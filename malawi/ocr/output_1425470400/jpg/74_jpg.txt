. Objectives

The overall objective of IFMSL phase II: “T o contribute to the reduction of poverty and the
conservation of forests in Malawi. "

The programme purpose of IFMSL phase II is: “To improve the livelihoods of forest dependent
communities through the participatory management of forests both in forest reserves and on
customary land by implementation of the National Forestry Programme .

IFSML II is based on the premise that participatory forest management will improve the
incomes of forest dependent communities through the sustainable use of both timber and non-
timber forest products, which in turn will lead to a reduced rate of deforestation, and hence the

conservation of forests in Malawi.

Both environmental sustainability and good governance are core components of the project.
Other cross cutting issues such as gender, HIV/AIDS, nutrition and civic education have been
fully integrated into the design and have also been allocated a speciﬁc FA budget line in order
to ensure that these issues are not overlooked in implementation of the project. Furthermore,
programmes on cross cutting issues will be a standing agenda item at FMB / Steering
Committee meetings. Where relevant and possible indicators will be disaggregated by gender.

Expected results

IFMSL H will first seek to clarify actors‘ respective roles in the sector and deﬁne the FD’s core
role. It will also help raise the importance of forestry in Malawi and forests’ linkages to
agricultural production and climate change mitigation. It will further clarify the roles and
responsibilities of actors with regards to participatory forest management in both forest reserves
and on customary land and build the capacity of both FD and communities to play their
respective management roles. By allowing communities to sustainably use forest products it will
reduce poverty and food insecurity which leads to unsustainable exploitation of forests. And
lastly, it will help the FD and GoM to establish more predictable funding from Treasury and
help move away from a dependency on periodic donor project funding by developing a clear
implementation schedule for the current NFP with a matching financing mechanism.

IFMSL II is expected to deliver the following results (links to the relevant NFP strategies are
show in brackets):

1) Institutional change and optimisation of policy inﬂuences on forest and livelihoods
(NFP strategies 1 and 2). The Forestry Department will be more skilled, professional and
client focused with a clearer structure suited to today’s liberalised economy. Decision
makers and Malawians will better understand the value and importance of forests. A clear
and effective M and E system for the NFP will be operational and a mapping of the forest
cover and its condition will be produced and updated periodically.

2) Local forest governance and community based forest management will be enhanced
including forest reserves (NFP strategies 3, 4 and 9). Management plans and agreements
for forest reserves and village forest areas will be functioning in all IFMSL II impact areas.
Communities will be better able to play a greater role in the management of forest reserves

and village forest areas.

3) Individual smallholder livelihoods will be improved (NFP strategy 5). Incomes of
smallholders in IFMSL H impact area will be increased by the sustainable use of forest
reserves and village forest areas, which in turn, will also ensure the sustainability of these
forest resources.

4) Forestry extension will be strengthened (NFP strategy 6). The FD extension will be
realigned and be capacitated so that it fully plays its role in PFM. FD extension will be
better coordinated with other line ministries. Individual forestry officers will be better
