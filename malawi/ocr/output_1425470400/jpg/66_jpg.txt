2. Institutional reform of the forestry sector, including the Department of Forestry.

Despite the need for institutional change being highlighted in the sectoral policy documents and
an initial attempt, in practice it has not happened. The NFP highlights the respective roles of the
four main actors in the sector (central government, local government, private sector and civil
society) and clearly indentiﬁes which actor should take the lead role in speciﬁc activities. For
the Forestry Department (FD) this needs to be intemalised and further detailed through the
revision of detailed job descriptions, individual annual objectives and a performance review
system which leads to prioritised training and capacity building. This was recommended by the
ETR of the Social Forestry Programme and the process started but needs to be revisited.

The current use of resources with the vast majority of GoM human resources (estimated to be in
excess of 7,000 people) employed on the plantations needs to be critically reviewed, particularly
in light of the MGDS and various sector documents’ recommendation of greater private sector
involvement in the sector. However, it is not simply a matter of transferring forest workers from
the plantations to the reserves as participatory forest management requires extension workers
with elevated capacities and skills (see points 4 and 5 below). Implementation of the
institutional change process will be explicitly supported by IFMSL II.

3. Better and more coherent data and information (M and E).

In the ﬁrst annual review of the MGDS only 3 out of the 7 forestry indicators had any data
whatsoever. The criticism of poor data and information systems has been made not only of the
forestry sector but also of the projects within the sector with both the Social Forestry ETR and
MTR of IFMSL I highlighting the need for better information systems. This lack of information
also severely hinders the ability to convince policy makers to take action on issues related to the
sector. Given that the FD does not have an accurate assessment of either the current forest cover
or the actual rate of deforestation, there is also a need to conduct a comprehensive national
inventory of Malawi’s forest areas.

The FD has drafted an M and E system for the National Forestry Programme but it has yet to be
ﬁnalised. IFMSL U will prioritise this activity which should be done with the full cooperation of
the National Statistics Ofﬁce, other relevant line ministries, Districts Authorities and the FAO
given their expertise in forestry statistics. Any such system needs to be compatible with no;
only the NFP but also the MGDS and Malawi’s international commitments in the sector.

4. Forest management needs to be more community driven

Although IFMSL I has made substantial progress on participatory forest management (PFM -
see section 1.2), the [FSML MTR concluded that PFM should strive to be more community
driven. While communities have participated in the elaboration of co-management plans and are
represented in the respective committees, forest management is often perceived as a ‘top-down’
approach with community ‘consultation' rather than their ‘active participation’. The day—to-day
implications of forestry policies, management plans and corresponding agreements are often
unclear to much of the community and need to be better explained. In addition, NRMCs are not
fully operational in many areas.

One of the underlying reasons is that forest extension services have been slow to adapt from
their previous role of ‘preserving and protecting’ forest reserves to a more participatory
approach of ‘forest management and use’ where they coordinate and facilitate activities. This
role requires forest extension workers with markedly different capacities and skills.

IFMSL second phase will seek to establish partnerships and collaboration with NSAs for
community mobilisation and empowerment.

5. More efﬁcient project implementation.

Numerous reviews have highlighted the need to improve project implementation'at various
levels through a number of actions. The ﬁrst is the need for continued capacrty building of both;
central government staff and district staff, with emphasrs on the forestry extepsron workers at}d
communities. One of the assumptions that IFMSL I made was that the Socral Forestry wou
