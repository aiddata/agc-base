Sector analysis

Forests and trees play essential roles in ensuring the continued productivity of the natural
resource base which underpins much of economic activity in Malawi. More than 89% of
households in Malawi depe

‘ nd on income derived, wholly or in part, from the exploitation of the
natural resource, mainly through agriculture, forestry and ﬁsheries.

Between 1972 and 1992 the Malawi‘s forest cover is estimated to have fallen from 46 % to

20%4 at a deforestation rate of 2.8% per annums. If this rate of deforestation continues, then in
10 years only 75% of today’s forests will remain and by 2020 only a little more than half will
remain. Such a change would impact Malawi’s forest based communities but would also
severely impact Malawi’s hydrology. soil fertility, biodiversity and undermine agricultural
production, which in turn would lead to major macro economic impact in a country where
agricultural production is directly correlated to GDP growth and export earnings.

The main underlying drivers for deforestation are fourfold, with the causes of these problems
lying outside the forestry sector itself. First, is increasing population pressure; Malawi’s
population is increasing at a rate of 2.8 % per annum (2008 Malawi Census) and Malawi
already has one of the highest population densities in Africa of which 85 % is rural. This means
that the average smallholder holding is less than 0.8 hectares. As population increases, forested
areas are increasingly cleared for agricultural production. It is estimated that currently a third of

 

Plans demarcate the areas or forest blocks (a single forest reserve can be divided into a number of forest blocks with
each forest block can have its own management plan and agreement) that are to be considered under the management
agreement, which in turn details how the forest area or block will be used and managed. It is necessary to have a plan
before having an agreement although in reality sometimes these are done simultaneously.

The area of Malawi is 118,484 km2 of which 20.6% is water, giving a total terrestrial area of 94,076 kmz. The
Department of Forestry estimates that Malawi‘s forest cover in 1972 stood at 4.4 million hectares in 1972 (equivalent
to 44,000 kmz) and this was reduced to 1.9 million hectares in 1992 (equivalent to 19,000 kmz). This loss represents a
decline of 2.8% per annum.

It should be noted that the MGDS estimates current forest cover to be 27.2%. This divergence in data reﬂects the fact

that no national forest inventory has been conducted for a number of years and that recent individual studies have
estimated deforestation to be between 0.9-3.5‘3/6.
