4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

4.1. Performance monitoring

The TCF'2 requires an integrated monitoring system to ascertain that it will contribute
to achievmg the goals of the NIP.

Through the selection of a short term Technical Assistant, the NAG will develop a
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system in order to ascertain that each and every
initiative undertaken under the TCF2 “ill be assessed by the beneﬁciaries in
accordance with (i) the original terms of reference, (ii) the overall contribution of the
initiative to assisting GoM in achieving the goals set in the NIP and (iii) the
crosscutting issues relevant to the initiative (gender, HIV/AIDS, environment etc).

lntemally, the Steering Committee will develop speciﬁc monitoring mechanisms to
supervise the ﬁnancial execution of the programme.

4.2. Evaluation

Complementing the provision for internal monitoring, the budget of the Programme
also includes provisions for external evaluation planned as follows: (i) a mid-term

review after a year and a half from the start of the programme implementation; (ii)
ﬁnal evaluation at the end of the implementation period.

Evaluation and audit contracts are always concluded by the Commission on acting for
