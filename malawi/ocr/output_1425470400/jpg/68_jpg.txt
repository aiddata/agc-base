From an environmental perspective the MGDS acknowledges the current weak management
which, exacerbated by increasing population pressure, chronic poverty and encroachment, has
led to a high rate of deforestation in Malawi (estimated to be currently 2.8% per annum).

In order to enhance the dual role of forests (income generation and pr0vision of environmental
services) in Malawi the MGDS calls for the reforestation of key areas, better coordinated and

improved forest management, the enforcement of existing forest regulations, and greater private
sector participation in the sector.

In short, while the MGDS does not explicitly make forestry a priority in itself it does highlight
how forests play an important role in priority areas i) agriculture and food security, ii) irrigation

and water development, iv) energy generation and supply, and vi) prevention and management
of nutrition disorders, HIV and AIDS as well as thematic areas a) sustainable economic growth,

b) social protection, and e) improved govemance. Examples of how forestry contributes to the
MGDS are given in attachment 4.

A number of high quality policy documents exist at sectoral level; these include the Forest
Policy of Malawi in 19962 and the Forestry Act in 1997. Both these doouments marked a shift in
policy from a protectionist approach towards a participatory forest management approach that
gives communities greater rights and responsibilities in forest management.

The Forest Policy provides the basis for communities to conserve and sustainably use forest
resources in order to generate income and reduce poverty. The policy also highlights the need

for major institutional change in the sector and the need to include the private sector in forest
management, particularly in the plantations.

The Forestry Act reﬂects the policy and outlines the roles and responsibilities of each actor in
different type of forest areas. For example, with regard to forest reserves it is the Department of
Forestry that must propose management plans with the agreement and participation of the
adjacent forest communities. Whereas on customary land the onus is on the village headman
and Village Natural Resource Management Committee (VNRMC — where one exists) to develop
a management plan with the assistance of Department of Forestry. In short, while the actors in
forest management are the same in both forest reserves and on customary land in the former the
FD has greater responsibility while on the latter it is the communities. The Act also details the
need for the creation of a Forest Management Board to advise the Minister on all matters
relating to tree and forest management in Malawi.

The Policy and the Act were subsequently followed by the National Forestry Programme (NFP)
in 2001, which was meant to openationalise both the Forest Policy and the Forestry Act by
‘translating good intentions into real results '. The programme was developed following
extensive consultations and clearly outlines how participatory forest management can help
alleviate poverty while at the same time ensuring the sustainability of the resource base. It

highlights 12 strategies each with a set of prioritised actions and sets out the roles each of the
main actors should play.

In the agriculture sector the recently adopted Agricultural Development Programme (ADP),
which has now be renamed the Agriculture SWAP (ASWAP), has three main pillars; food
security; natural resource management; and agro-processing. The ASWAP acknowledges the
essential role that trees and forests play in natural resource management and the importance of
fruit trees as a means of improving nutrition and mitigating food insecurity.

Current situation

However, since the adoption of the framework documents mentioned above (Policy 1996, Act
1997 and Programme 2001) there has been a significant ‘implementation gap’. Since 2005 the
main vehicle for implementation of these policies has been IFMSL 1. After three years ‘of
implementation of [FMSL I a number of important achievements have been reached With
regards to the policy framework including the following points.

 

A supplement to the National Forest Policy 1996 titled ‘Community Based Management” was published in July 2003
