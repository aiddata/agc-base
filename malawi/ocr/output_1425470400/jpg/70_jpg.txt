)onor coordination

Overall there is a clear division of labour between the EC and Member Sates (UK, DE, FR,
IRL) and other donors in Malawi with the EU taking a leading in agriculture, food security and
natural resources and other member states mainly focusing on the social sectors.

While coordination structures exist in the agriculture sector — notably the Donor Committee on
Agriculture and Food Security (DCAF S) — they seldom deal with forestry, partly because few
donors are active in the sector. An initiative to set up a DCAF S sub-group on environment and
forestry has not worked. Only the EU supports the sector directly, while a number of other
donors (Norway, WB, USAID, UN) have either ad hoc projects of limited size or projects with
forestry components. More recently, the FAO has established an NFP facility and the UNDP is
assisting in establishing a carbon unit within the FD to assist with implementation of projects on
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) activities under the
UNFCCC. The FD in liaison ’vn'th the Department of National Parks and Wildlife, the
University of Malawi, the Malawi Environment Endowment Trust (MEET), and with ﬁnancing
from USADD through COMPASS II. have put in place an institutional framework for

coordination of REDD projects in Malawi As a result two REDD projects, one in a forest

reserve and another in a national park. are ready for implementation depending on interest from
international carbon buyers.

Given the clear need for better coordination and stronger political dialogue in the sector, IFMSL
11 Will support the operation of the high level FMB and the reconvening of the National Forest
Forum (NFF) at a more operational level. The National Forest Forum will include central and
local government, NGOs,

' private sector and all cooperating partners in the sector. The NFF will
glsodconstitute the Malaw1’s liaison group to the African Forest Forum, which is supported by
we en.

In addition, IFMSL U will assist the FD to update the NFP, create a clear strategy and realistic
timetable for its implementation, and the set up the necessary ﬁnancial structures for sector
budget support. It is highly likely that this would bring back other donors to the sector.

)ESCRIPTION

IFMSL phase II builds on the achievements of IFMSL I and supports the implementation of the

Forest Policy and the Forestry Act by supporting the strategies and actions highlighted in the
National Forestry Programme.

IFMSL II is an interim step between IFMSL I ‘project’ - whose result areas and activities,
although in line with the NFP, did not map entirely on to those of the NFP - and sector budget
support. IFMSL II is not as broad as the NFP, it supports 8 of the 12 NFP strategies. It should
also be noted that IFSML II does not necessary support all the activities listed in the NFP under
each of these 8 strategies.

For the sake of coherence, at times two or more NFP strategies have been mergedinto one result
area under IFMSL 11 (see overview in attachment 5). However, in order to maintain a strong
link with the NFP the wording of the results areas, and corresponding activities, has been kept
identical to the NFP. Attachment 5 maps IFMSL H result areas against the NFP strategies and
shows the NFP activities that will be supported under each IFMSL II result area.

For ease of reference an initial logical framework is attached. It may be updated or adapted in
the Overall Work Plan, to which it will be annexed, without this necessarily requiring an
amendment to the financing agreement.
