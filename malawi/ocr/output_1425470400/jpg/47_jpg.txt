have improved the capacity of staff of the FD to the necessary level for efﬁcient project
implementation; the IFMSL I MTR found that assumption to be incorrect. Previous reviews
(Social Forestry) found that capacity building was more effective if done ‘on the job’ rather than
through academic courses. Capacity building should not just focus on PFM issues but also
include modules on the policy framework, management, planning, M&E, and ﬁnancial control
for all staff, although recently there has been a marked improvement in the latter.

The second is better coordination with other line ministries, particularly at central government
level, and also with other stakeholders, especially NGOs, in the sector. In order to assist high
level coordination IFMSL U will support the operation of the Forest Management Board (F MB),
which will also be used as the Steering Committee of IFMSL II. The FMB brings together
numerous government line ministries and other non state actors and was originally created by
the Forestry Act but has yet to be fully operationalised. In addition, IFMSL will support the
reconvening of the former National Forestry Forum, which will assist coordination at an
operational level. This approach is in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness on
reducing transaction costs and supporting ownership. Furthermore, IF SML II will support
activities under the NFP to improve coordination of extension services between ministries.

6. Further integration of cross cutting issues.

All projects in Malawi must intensify efforts to better integrate cross cutting issues on
HIV/AIDS, gender, nutrition and civic education. To ensure that these issues are considered
during implementation a speciﬁc FA budget line has been created for cross cutting activities.
Progress on cross cutting issues will also be a standing item on the agenda of the Steering

Committee which will use the jointly developed guidelines (projects / ECD) for integrating
HIV/ AIDS - attachment 7, in addition to COM policy.

Complementary

There are a number of ongoing ECWEL' funded complementary actions. These include: Farm
Actions Income Diversiﬁcation Programme (FIDP) Phase I (9lh EDF € 16.2 million; phase 11
10th EDF, €203 million). FIDP is an integrated agricultural programme that looks to improve
natural resource management (soil fertility, water availability); diversiﬁcation of produce
(including fruit trees); and agric-business (including irrigation). In a number of cases IFMSL I
impact areas protect catchments areas of FIDP I irrigation schemes.

The GoM / EU 9th EDF National Initiative for Civic Education (NICE), part of the Promotion of
the Rule of Law and Civic Education project in Malawi (9Lh EDF, € 28 million) has four main
components one of which is forestry. l’ﬂCE operates through a network of over 163 rural

libraries and information points and delivers key messages through all forms of media including
dramas.

A number of NGO projects funded by the EC budget lines also have forestry components
including three Concern Universal projects"); The Mkhumba Boundary Communities'
Improvement Project has adopted the co-management model developed by the IFMSL I With
communities‘ surrounding Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve.

A number of other GoM/EU funded related projects such as; the 4th Micro Project Programme
(8 ACP MAI 41); the Income Generating Public Works Programme (9 ACP MAI 17) and the
support for the Implementation of Malawi's Land Reform Programme (9 ACP MAI 12) all had
forestry components or dealt with related issues But Will have ended by the time that IFMSL II
starts. The feasibility study for the remaining 10 EDF prOJects 1n the agriculture focal area, €
80 million Community Based Activities and Small-scale Irrigation Programme (COBASSIP)
and the 6 15 million Capacity Building Programme (CBP) has been undertaken but the
programming exercise is still on going.

 

Msamala Environmental Rehabilitation and Livelihoods Improvement Project (€ 982,990), Mkhumba Boundary
Communities‘ Livelihoods Improvement Project (6 1,173,541), Kasumbu Food Security Improvement Project (€

1,236,060) as well as MALEZA's Participatory Sustainable Management of Forest and Natural Resources of
Lilongwe River Watershed PrOject (€ 624,516).
