existing agricultural land is marginal. Efforts to intensify agriculturalproduction by increasing
yields, such as through the EDF ftmded GoM/EU Farm Income DiverSiﬁcation Programme

(FIDP), may assist in mitigating some of this pressure.

Second, is the high incident of poverty and food insecurity. Despite'falling poverty rates and
three consecutive years of national food security - due to the COM input subsrdy programme
and good rainfall - Malawi had previously suffered cyclical food crises at national level.
However, even in years of national food security many households have insufﬁcient food to
feed themselves during the annual “lean period’ (December - March). Food insecurity leads to
the adoption of unsustainable coping strategies many of which result in deforestation and the
unsustainable exploitation of forests and trees. For example, increased charcoal production is
often seen as a proxy indicator for increased food insecurity. Although Malawi has yet to feel
the full impacts of the global food and credit crises, if it does then it is expected that food
insecurity will increase, and hence lead to further pressure on forests.

Third, is that 93% of the all energy used in Malawi is derived from biomass. The highly
ruralised population is dependent on fuel wood as a source of energy for cooking and heating as
there are few alternatives and access to electricity is both limited geographically and
economically. However, a number of efficiency measures can signiﬁcantly reduce the amount
of ﬁrewood neededé. In contrast, charcoal production — a 6 30 million industry per year — is
generally an income generating income for rural inhabitants sold to urban areas, where
alternatives often exist but charcoal is preferred.

Fourth, is the lack of secure land tenure and open access on customary land which has led to a
classrc tragedy of the commons ’ situation. The passing of the new Land Bill will allow for the

surveying and registering of customary land, which in turn will he] ensure '
communities and individuals. p property ﬁghts 0f

In short, the National Forestry3Prograrmne estimates that overall aggregate annual demand for
forest products is 15 million m , double what can currently be sustainably produced (7-8 million

m ) under current management systems. To achieve sustainability demand must be reduced and
/ or supply increased through more productive forest management.

The main weaknesses in the sector include; weak and uncoordinated management both within
government and between government and other actors in the sector; inapprOpriate institutional
structures and use of human resources, with the vast majority of human resources (estimated to
be 7,000 persons) being employed on the plantations; and the constant movement of the

Depa1)’tment of Forestry between different line ministries (it has changed 6 times in the last 13
years .

However, the recent move in February 2009 of the Department of Forestry from the Ministry of
Energy and Mines to the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources also represents an
opportunity to reenergise the programme and to make the changes necessary to achieve
progress, as well as assisting with the issue of land tenure. The potential for change maybe
further enhanced by the formation of a new Government and Parliament, following the elections
in May 2009.

Further momentum can be created by underlining the strong links between the programme and
other international and national political priorities. The first is climate change, which is one of
the highest priorities of the international community. Proper forest management will help to
mitigate the impacts of climate change in Malawi as well as to contribute to the storage of
carbon. A second and related issue is that of irrigation, currently one of the highest political

 

In 1996, the GTZ Integrated Food Security Programme developed an improved portable stove called “Chitetezo
Mbaula” (meaning the ‘protecting stove’). Participatory tests in public cooking demonstrations have given an average
of 60% firewood saving compared to the traditional three-stone fire. The use of improved “rock stoves” reduces
ﬁrewood consumption by 70-90 %. Further advantages of using the improved stoves are reduced health risks from
smoke inhalation or burns.

The ‘tragedy of the commons' was described by Hardin in 1968 as a dilemma in which multiple individuals acting
independently in their own self-interest can ultimately destroy a shared natural resource even though it is clear that it
is not in anyone's long term interest for this to happen.
