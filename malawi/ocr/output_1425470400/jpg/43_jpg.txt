priorities in Malawi with the President‘s soon to be announced ‘Green Belt Initiative’. Water
availability and sustainability is highly inﬂuenced by forests. And third is the issue of nutrition,
which is also a high national priority given that chronic level of malnutrition in Malawi which
has changed little over the past 50 years. The importance of forests for livelihoods and nutrition
is often underestimated. Non-timber forest products as wild ﬁ'uits, roots and mushrooms

supplement agricultural production, especially in times of food insecurity where wild foods
serve as a buffer for communities.

However, a number of risks to progress in the sector are apparent. So far many structural
changes proposed by the Forest Policy, Forestry Act and the National Forestry Programme have
not happened, despite being explicitly stated as necessary.

Summary

IFMSL phase II (IFMSL II) will build on the achievements of IFMSL I and seek to support the
implementation of the Forest Policy and the Forestry Act by supporting many of the priorities
and actions highlighted in the National Forestry Programme, including: i) manage the process of
institutional change and optimise policy inﬂuences on forests and livelihoods; ii) enhance local
forest governance and community based forest management including forest reserves; iii)

improve individual smallholder livelihoods; iv) strengthen forestry extension; and iv) develop
forest sector ﬁnancing.

Lessons learnt and complementarity

The EC has considerable experience in the forestry sector in Malawi which started in 1997 with
the former GoM / EU Social Forestry project (7 ACP MAI 65). This was followed by IFSML
phase I, which was subjected to a number of reviews including a ROM in 2007 and a MTR in
2008. The overall conclusions of the two reviews were broadly positive, awarding 6 83 (good)
and 4 Cs (problems), but they also highlighted a number of issues. These issues arose from the

insufficient implementation of the policy documents (Policy, Act, NFP) in certain areas, rather
than missing elements from the policies themselves.

1. Need for greater advocacy to increase political support for both forestry, and in
particular, for participatory forest management (PFM).

There is a need for greater, and broader, political will to both publicise and follow up on the
implementation of the existing policies (Policy, Act, and NFP). Currently politicians and key
decision makers are unaware of the real value — in economic, social and environmental terms —
of forests in Malawi. This is partly due to the fact that current methods fail to reﬂect forestry’s
true contribution to GDP by excluding a number of products such as ﬁer wood and charcoala.
Charcoal trade alone was estimated at 6 30 million per year in 2007 by a joint GoM/EU/U SAID
studyg. These issues of under reporting are compounded by the Forest Department’s reporting
systems that are not compatible with those of the National Statistics Ofﬁce (N SO). Economic
evaluations of the environmental value of forests can serve to highlight linkages to other sectors.

While IFMSL I included the drafting and implementation of a communication strategy this was
done by the FD itself which, given that it is part of the hierarchy that it is trying to influence,
made it less effective. Advocacy is now a key result area and the number andambition of
communication activities under phase H has been signiﬁcantly increased. In addition, phase II
will recruit non state actors (NSAs) who are often more effective communicators and able to
operate with greater independence than government departments.

consumption, trade and production in Malawi. The estimated value of the charcoal industry in the four largest urban
areas of Malawi is approximately MKW5.78 billion (equivalent to € 30 million). This puts the value of the charcoal
on a similar level as that of Malawi’s tea industry. and accounts for about 0.5% of the country’s GDP.
