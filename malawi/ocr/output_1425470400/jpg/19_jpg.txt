. Economic and social situation

Malawi has a population of approximately 13 million of which 52.4 % live below the poverty
line and 22.4 % are classiﬁed as ‘ultra-poor’ meaning that they are unable to meet their basic
necds'. It ranks 164 out of 177 countries on the 2007/8 Human Development Index with an
annual GDP per capita of USS 265. Malawi covers an area of 118 500 km2 and is one of the
most densely populated countries in sub-Saharan Africa with average land holding of 0.8 of a
hectare per household. Approximately 88 % of the population live in rural areas and the
majority of them depend heavily on the natural resources base for their livelihoods.

Maize surpluses in the past three years. due to favourable rains and the GoM/donor input
subsidy scheme, have helped raise real GDP from 2.1% in 2005 to an average of approximately
8% over the past three years, a record for Malawi. In addition, both inﬂation and interest rates
have decreased signiﬁcantly over the past three years. These improvements in the macro
economic situation are expected to have a positive impact on private sector investment and
growth.

However, notwithstanding the remarkable progress of the last few years, Malawi’s economy
remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, such as the recent spike in oil and fertiliser prices.
The very recent deterioration in terms of trade is in the order of 4% of GDP (or approximately
USD 160 million) with a very negative impact on foreign exchange reserves

A GoM report on progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) issued prior to the
recent oil and fertilizer shocks, suggested that poverty had recently decreased from to 52.4 % to
45 % meaning that Malawi had been on track to achieve the MDG 1 target. Progress on other
MDGs was mixed.

Policy context

Malawi’s overarching policy document is the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS), a second generation PRSP which was ad0pted in 2006 for the period 2006-11, it seeks
to transform Malawi from a "predominater importing and consuming country to a producing
and exporting nation It has a very high level of national ownership and commitment.

The MGDS identiﬁes six key priority areas where progress is considered critical for poverty
alleviation in Malawi. These six areas are i) agriculture and food security, ii) irrigation and
water development, iii) transport infrastructure, iv) energy generation and supply, v) integrated
rural development, and vi) prevention and management of nutrition disorders, HIV and AIDS.
In addition, the MGDS also identiﬁes ﬁve thematic areas in which progress must be made if the
strategy is to be successful. These thematic areas are; a) sustainable economic growth, b) social
protection, c) social development, (1) infrastructure development, and e) improved governance.

The MGDS highlights the dual roles of forestry in both income generation — and hence potential
for poverty alleviation — and in providing essential environmental services, particularly for
agricultural production. It suggests that greater income generation can be achieved by ‘better’
consumptive use, that is, by increasing forest productivity and increasing added value on forest
products, as well as by the non-consumptive use of forests, such as tourism.
