THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
Title : Malawi Backlog Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Programme
(MABARM)
Accounting N°: 9 ACP MAI 021
Identiﬁcation N°: MAI/006/04

 

Transport infrastructure is a focal sector of EC intervention in Malawi and the government, at the
time of the 9th EDF mid—term review, has restated the critical importance of road infrastructure.

This country is land-locked and good Internal and cross~border road links are vital. Assistance

Road Sector Programme has been launched (January 2005), with the objective of harmonising
donor input and updating and improving investment and maintenance planning.

The MABARM project provides support to the NRA and MOT PW in tackling the backlog of
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation that the Road Fund has not been able to cover. This
assistance is vital to protect assets that would otherwise deteriorate rapidly. The road sections
selected are those identiﬁed as highest priority by NRA and for which Economic Internal rate of

participate. Simple technical solutions will be adopted. In parallel with this project, training
courses will be conducted through the National Construction Industry Council (NCIC) for both
contractors and consultants. A separate 9[11 BDF programs of capacity building in the transport
sector will provide technical assistance to transport public bodies, from which MABARM will

encouraged.

The cost of the MABARM programme is E 38 million from the Malawi 9th EDF NIP allocation.
The implementation period ends on 31 December 2010.

 

2. Intervention
2.1 Overall objectives

_ The overall objective is to improve mobility of goods and people. The Logical Framework is
given in Annex 1.

2.2 Project purpose

The project purpose is sustainable improvement of the road network
2.3 Results

The main results of the programme will be:

A) Backlog maintenance reduced (661 km of road to be improved);
B) Increased road maintenance competence in NRA and MoTPW;
C) Increased capacity of local contracting and consulting industry;
D) Road safety improved on repaired sections;

E) Accompanying measures for increased HIV/AIDS, gender, environmental, road safety
awareness.

 

2.4 Activities

- Backlog maintenance on main and urban roads: Karonga-Songwe M1, Bwengu- Chiweta
M1, Lilongwe-Nsipe M1, Chikwawa—(Nchalo)—Bangula M1, Chiromo Washaway including
rail embankment 8152, Chikwawa-Nchalo Ml, Balaka-Salima M5, Mzuzu~Bwengu Ml,
Mangochi-Liwondwe M10, urban roads in Lilongwe, Blantyre and Mzuzu (144 km of fog
spray i.e. bittunen rejuvenation, 254 km of reseal, 145 km of asphalt overlay, 98 km of base
improvement and reseal, and 20 km of sub-base improvement - see Annex 2; ‘

0 Training of GoM engineers and administrative staff: Improvement in capacity of NRA
personnel in technical design, tender dossier preparation, tendering, tender evaluation,
contract administration: This will be achieved under the guidance and supervision of
consultants already active within the NRA (under the Lakeshore Road Inﬁastructure Support
Programme, 8 ACP MAI 30 or new consultants to be hired under the 9th EDF project
Capacity Building of Transport Public Sector Bodies). Ministry of transport technical
capacity will be assisted by the possibility of secondment of engineers to the work sites to
assist the consulting engineers engaged for the supervision. Training will be made available
(under the 9th EDF programme Institutional Support to Transport Public Bodies);

- Promotion of involvement of Malawi contractors and consultants: Technical solutions
and contract sizes will be designed to facilitate local involvement. Training will be made
available (under the 9‘h EDF programme Institutional Support to Transport Public Bodies);

0 Road safety improvement actions: These will be incorporated in the designs and addressed
at institutional level;

0 HIV/AIDS, gender, and environmental actions: These themes will be addressed through
dedicated studies and will be built into works contracts as appropri ate.

2.5 Indicators

Indicators relevant to the execution of the work, to the capacity building component and to the
Cross-cutting actions will be used (see Logical Framework, Annex 1).

 

 

  

 

25 Lessons from past experience

The experience of many years of donor intervention in the road sector is that investments in road
inﬁastmcture should be Considered together with capacity for management, maintenance and
sustainability. Failure to do this often results in rapid deterioration of the roads, which do not
reach their design lives and a loss of the investment. In practice, this means that interventions in
poorer countries are often restricted to protecting the existing network rather than extending it
and thereby increasing the maintenance burden. This is the concept adopted in Malawi.

To more efﬁciently identify maintenance needs, provide adequate funding and carry out timely
maintenance work, governments adopted a philosophy that road users should bear the full costs
of road maintenance and work should be organised and implemented through an autonomous
Road Authority, as described in the SADC Protocol on Transport, Communications and
Meteorology, 1996. Malawi has followed this route, in cooperation with donors, with the
creation of the National Roads Authority in 1997.

Recent history also shows that, although the Malawi road network is in reasonable condition
compared with that in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, the government does not have adequate
resources to protect and maintain it. This has been compounded by declining revenues, in real
terms, over the three years to September 2004 with no change to the Fuel Levy, decreasing value
of the kwacha and the introduction of a 17.5% surtax on road maintenance activities, though the
surtax burden was offset by revenues from road user charges being directed to the road fund. The
government has been sensitised to this issue of insufﬁcient revenue, though a drive is needed to
correctly assess the revenue requirements based on appropriate standards for road maintenance
interventions. Lack of data and effective analysis has been identiﬁed as a major constraint to
. effective planning of maintenance and development in both the short and longer term in the
roads sector.

The establishment of the NRA in 1998 was accompanied by a migration of staff from the
MoTPW and a reduction in capacity at the ministry, with the leading role in the road sector being
effectively assumed by the NRA. Current developments include a separation of the functions of
Road Fund revenue collection and operations, the reorganisation of operations departments of
NRA and strengthening of the policy-making role of MoTPW. This should lead to a clariﬁcation
of roles.

2.7 Linkage with other operations

The European Union is the largest single donor in the road sector and the EDF is currently
funding or planning a number of complementary actions (total about €130 million) in support of
rehabilitation and maintenance works, rural access, axle load control, road safety, network
monitoring, development of the contracting industry, and the improvement and restructuring of
public bodies in the transport sector. Technical assistance for MABARM will be provided under
the current Lakeshore Road Infrastructure Support Programme (8 ACP MAI 30) and the
proposed 9th EDF Institutional Support to Transport Sector Public Bodies. MABARM targets
bituminised roads forming part of the primary network. Other programmes e. g. the 8th and 9th
EDF Public Works Programmes, the 9th EDF Rural Feeder Roads Project and the multLdonor
funded Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) tackle other unpaved road categories down to-
district and rural access level.

The World Bank and Nordic Development Fund have a current ($40 million) Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Programme (ROMARP) that includes: road sector policy development and
studies for Ministry of Transport and Public Works; systems development and equipment for

 

 

 

NRA; technical assistance and studies for the National Construction Industry Council (NCIC)
and road rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance. Other donors in the sector, who have

contributed to road and bridge construction and training by loan or grant funding include Kmt,
JICA, Kuwait/ OPEC/BADEA and ADB.

The only other donor with a major stake in the transport sector is the World Bank (together with
NDF) through the ROMARP programme. Coordination meetings are arranged during regular
WB missions to the country. The ﬁrst steps have recently been taken towards establishment of a ‘

.2.8 Results of economic and cross-sectoral appraisal

The road sections included in this project are those identiﬁed and considered by GoM to be the
highest priority sections for which backlog maintenance is outstanding. Based on economic
analysis, economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were initially estimated solely on the basis of
pavement rehabilitation of certain main roads and results are shown in the table below. The
appraisal has been carried out using HDM4 over a 10-year economic life (to cover the period

between major periodic maintenance interventions) with intervention taken to be implemented in
2006.

*Net present value

[EIRR] are above the Opportunity Cost of Capital [OCC], taken to be 12 percent. The high EIRR
value calculated for the Lilongwe-Nsipe Rd is as a result of the much higher trafﬁc on that road.
It would be similarly expected that urban roads with high trafﬁc volumes would also attract a
high internal rate of return, and be manifestly viable. Additional data collection and analysis is
required to ensure that urban project roads are prioritised in economic, strategic and social term 5-

It is expected that the EIRR based on periodic maintenance (for those roads now considered for
that intervention standard) will be similar or higher. Tables of Vehicle Operating Costs (V DC)
have been prepared for paved, gravel and earth roads for different vehicle classes and at varying
road roughness conditions. These will be used to estimate the VOC savings and to assist with the
conﬁrmation of intervention standard and the prioritisation of the project roads.

 

 

Where necessary, environmental impact assessments (BIAS) will be carried out and their ﬁndings
taken into account during project implementation. The Environmental Affairs Department has

already advised that the Lilongwe-Nsipe, Bwengu-Chiweta and KarongaSongwe road sections
will not require ELAs.

The project will provide employment opportunities to men and women and works contractors
will be encouraged to adopt gender equitable employment policies wherever practicable.

Works tender dossiers will include speciﬁcations covering environmental management during
the construction phase and maintenance period. Key focal areas will include the management of
contractor’s equipment, facilities and personnel; extraction of construction materials and
reinstatement of borrow pits; and waste disposal. HIV/AIDS awareness, road safety awareness
and social interventions will also be included, where appropriate, in. either the works tender
dossiers or as activities closely linked to the implementation of the works contracts.

3. Implementation
3.1 Physical and non-physical means

The project will be carried out through works contracts of modest size, facilitating the
participation of Malawi consultants and contractors.

3.2 Organisation and implementation procedures

The project will be executed through decentralised management with the NAG acting as
Contracting Authority and the NRA or new road agencies acting as supervisor. Where possible

maintenance is carried out. Each of the sections identiﬁed will be divided into segments and
appropriate intervention will be made for each segment. The types of intervention, which are
well known in Malawi, will fall into the following categories:

1. Patch and seal, chip seal or patch and fog spray

‘ 2. Asphalt overlay

3. Base improvement, double surface treatment
. Sub-base improvement, base replacement, double surface treatment

This method of maintenance will not necessarily restore each section to its original condition, but
represents the most cost effective intervention. Such an approach is necessary in view of the
overall volume of backlog maintenance necessary.

it is not intended to widen or realign the existing roads, though it is considered beneﬁcial to
Improve and/or seal the shoulders. This has a dual purpose, ﬁrstly it ensures a more durable road,

and secondly it will reduce road trafﬁc accidents by moving bicycle and pedestrian trafﬁc away
from the fast moving trafﬁc. The widths of the target roads are generally in eXcess of 6m with
1.5m Shoulders. This is considered satisfactory for the standard of service needed. Generally, the
designs will follow the SATCC design guidelines.

Particular attention will be paid to drainage, as insufﬁcient or poorly designed drainage results in
premature degradation and relatively modest investments in this respect can contribute
