Dear Ms Rocharebello

Following completion of the documentation between Valid Nutrition and Irish Aid covering funding of
€75,000 (part funded also by Gorta) for establishing a laboratory at the factory in Malawi, the purpose of this

letter is to formally request that you disburse the funds into the account as indicated in the recent MOU dated
18th October 2010.

Can you please kindly confirm when these funds have been paid into the account as the project is due to start
shortly.

Valid Nutrition appreciates the support of Irish Aid on this important project.

Yours sincerely,

Derek Staveley
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer

 

With

 

 

Progosal for the establishment of food] cherriistryI
microbiology and physical testing laboratory

gt the UN Factory in Malawi

1. CURRENT STATUS

There are no testing facilities within the Malawi Factory at present. The Factory thereiore uses the services of

external laboratories for analytical testing of raw materials, finished products and environmental
microbiological monitoring.

 

Testing is an essential part of the quality assurance and hygiene monitoring programmes and is aiso used to
facilitate positive release of ingredients into the manufacturing process and finished product to customers.
Quality Assurance testing is particularly critical given that the Malawi Factory manufactures Ready to Use

Therapeutic Food which is used in the treatment of vulnerable children suffering, from severe acute
malnutrition.

2. CQRRENT TESTING ARRANGEMENTS

The availability of testing services in Malawi is very limited and the oniy provider offering; a wide range of
physical, chemical and microbiological tests is the Malawi Bureau of Standards {MES}. They area government
~run institution within the Ministry of Trade, Commerce 8i industry providing the services oi analysis,
inspection, calibration and training as well as being the National Standards institution for Malawi. MES are
currently used by VN Malawi to provide most of the testing requirements for its Factory.

Other available laboratories include:

565, an international laboratory service with a local office in Lilongwe using regional laboratories in
South Africa St Kenya.

- NASFAM (A small farmholders association) in conjunction with ICRJSAT lCrop research Nltitiii have
aflatoxin testing equipment.

University of Malawi, Chancellor College conducts laboratory testing and can offer some services.
ADMARC is a commercial para-statal organisation which promotes trade in smallholder agricultural
commodities and has an ability to test for aflatoxin.

3. THE NEED FOR CHANGE

 

3.1 Control & Reliability

Over the last few months there have been numerous probiems with the reliability oi testing from MES. This
includes minerals, vitamins, and other chemical testing such as protein; more recently the testing and related
results have caused some major issues for both VN Malawi and their customers because of the. unreliability of:
aflatoxin testing. ADMARC can also offer allatoxin testing but there are. concerns about: the reliability of
results due to the methodology in place. They are also situated in a remote area which creates further
difficulties

i.

3.2 Lime

The external testing process from sampling through to raising a purchase order, collemion/despatch of
samples, analysis and then final reporting can take a considerable amount of time depending; upon the specilic
test and the laboratory involved. However the shortest lead time from MESS is around one weelt for the
simpler tests, but considerably longer for more complex analyses. Further delays occur it a laboratory runs
out of chemicals or standards, which is a relatively regular occurrence.

3.3 Cost

Whilst cost is not the major driver for this proposed investment project, its implementation will result in
substantial cost savings on a number of tests including aflatoxin testing which currenth costs €55 per test: with
565 and £15 from NASFAM compared with an average cost of 4510—15 per test in—house depending on the
number of tests conducted at any one time.

35 Benefits
The primary benefit of the project will be in terms of strict control over the testing, process winch will both
enhance and improve confidence and reliability in the results and related quality assurance.

 

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Factory will have the ability to conduct more frequent testing as required, thus improving knowledge oi
both product and process.

Reduction in time to obtain results will be equally beneficial in a number of other areas:

0 Raw materials — approval of samples prior to purchases as well as ongoing quality monitoring;

0 Process — monitoring of factory hygiene through environmental swabbing as well as product: quality;
Page 2

‘ a Product — Testing and approval for release of finished product to customer.

There will also be an overall reduction in analytical costs.

4. RANGE OF PRDPQ§ED TESTING FACILITIES

d.1 Range of proposed testing ability

A - Chemical
Aflatoxin, Fat, Peroxide Value, Protein

8 - Microbiological

Coliforms, Mesophillic aerobes, Salmonella spp., Yeasts 8: moulds, Stapylococcuc so.

Q. - Physich

Moisture, Particle size, Microscopy
a Other testing requirements

. The ability to undertake non-routine testing of vitamins and minerals is not covered in the scope of this;
proposal. These tests will continue to be outsourced to external laboratories including 5565 and can be
included in a follow up phase.

5. QQ§T ESTIMMES
5.1 Building works

An area of the existing Malawi Factory of approximately 25 square metres over tl‘iree rooms has; been:
identified as suitable to house a general testing laboratory, a microbiological testing areal, together with an
office and a small store. The area needs to be converted before it is; fit for purpose and that process will
involve some internal building 84. fabrication, plumbing, wiring, lighting, tiling, of walls, painting and the.
installation of work benches, cupboards and shelving.

5.2 P rsonn I, trainin

. It is envisaged that the Quality Assurance Officer will manage the laboratory as part of the (In function and a
Laboratory Technician will be recruited to carry out testing procedure. A Laboratory "l"'echnician will likely be
appointed at Grade 5 and have experience of a wide range of laboratory procedures. Full job training; will be.
provided including a potential offer of training from an accredited Ull< lab-oratory.
