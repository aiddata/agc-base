1. Introduction.

The prominent Mount Mulanje lies alongside the Mozambican frontier in the south-eastern corner
of Malawi and stands as the highest montane feature between the Kilimanjaro complex in
Tanzania and the Drakensberg in South Africa. This rugged mountain environment rises to 3,002
metres above sea level and covers an area of 650km2 across the two administrative districts of
Mulanje and Phalombe. Typical of inselberg geomorphology, this mountain is strikingly impressive
as its sheer cliffs rise out of the surrounding plains at 550m a.s.l. up to an extensive undulating
plateau level at over 2,000m a.s.l. with this area then interspersed by the heights of over 25 peaks.

The mountain is home to a diverse vegetation profile and with the addition of exotic plantations,
has maintained the protected area status of Forest Reserve since 1927. The Department of
Forestry is the mandated government agency responsible for the professional management of the
mountain resources and environment. The varied miombo, riverine, rain and cedar cloud forests
are home to a unique plant and animal life. Over fifty plants are endemic to Mt Mulanje as are a
number of mammals, reptiles and amphibians, fish and insect species.

In addition to its forests, the mountain has value to many, offering a significant watershed, unique
genetic resources, varied livelihood requirements and an attractive tourism destination. Mulanje is
surrounded by an intensive population density where local densities of over 200 people / km2 are
not unusual and therefore the economic importance of the area requires careful consideration to
enable a sustainable resource use regime. Receiving the highest rainfall in southern Africa at over
4,000mm per annum, the water resources of Mt Mulanje offer enormous potential in various ways
to benefit commerce and the local communities.

Management of the Forest Reserve by the Department of Forestry follows the guidance of a
prevailing management plan which is developed with the assistance of MMCT within the context of
existing forestry policy, legislation and procedures. The department has a number of offices
around the mountain to support activities and many additional forestry staff members are based at
village level with the responsibility to regulate resource use.

The Department of Forestry has also maintained a role to manage the tourism accommodation on
the mountain. Whilst most of the tourism facilities around the mountain are commercially owned or
managed, the facilities on the mountain are managed largely by the department. There exists
across the mountain top a network of nine department managed huts of good standard that are
available for the use of tourists. These huts are accessible by fifteen paths from below and
interlinked by trails over the mountain provided for some of the best hiking and climbing in
southern Africa. Of note, is that the Chambe peak west-face at a vertical height of over 1.7km, is
the highest rock climb available in Africa.

2. Background to the Issues.

2.1 Deteriorating Management Capacity.

The management authority, the Department of Forestry, has steadily experienced a reduction in
budgeted expenditure for operational costs and lacked the leadership to dynamically adapt to
reorganize itself based upon the commercial potential of its plantation resources. The operational
ability of the management authority has degraded, the staffing levels have become inadequate,
professional and technical skills have deteriorated, and inevitably the execution of management
responsibilities has declined. The state of the national economy and the impact of HIV-AIDS were
contributing factors to this demise.

Concern over the state of conservation management increased substantially over the 1980’s when
the prevailing situation showed widespread wildfire damage over all the mountain habitats and
deteriorating mountain infrastructure, and a sharp increase in encroachment into the Reserve and
the illegal harvesting of resources. Additional effects of this dire situation were the rapid spread of
invasive pines across the mountain as the department had no capacity to maintain the Chambe
and Sombani pine plantations to an adequate standard of silviculture. In the early 1990’s, Mr Jim
Chapman a forester with great expertise and experience on the mountain, scribed a ‘Plea for Mt
Mulanje’ which focused wide attention to the deteriorating plight of Mt Mulanje.

2.2 The establishment of the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust.

During the 1990’s, efforts were consolidated through an extended process to develop an
organization with the objective to specifically address the concerns on Mt Mulanje. Concerned
individuals and organizations led by the National Herbarium & Botanic Gardens (NHBG) and the
Wildlife & Environmental Society of Malawi (WESM) developed a forum that was able to attract
and consolidate interest in the plight of Mt Mulanje.

Consultations were ongoing over several years to determine the most appropriate manner of
establishing support to Mt Mulanje as it was apparent that the capacity of the management
authority would continue to decline. Those involved were stakeholders from district level such as
the traditional authorities, district assemblies and smallholder farmers, to the other mandated
government departments representing the environment, water and tourism sectors; to scientific
organizations such as Forestry Research Institute of Malawi, Chancellor College and the NHBG,
and those organisations with special interests such as WESM and the Mountain Club of Malawi.

In 2000, these efforts culminated in the official registration of the Mulanje Mountain Conservation
Trust under the Trustees Incorporation Act with a constitution that specified representation at a
governance level to most of those organizations involved in the formation process. It is of note
that MMCT was not structured or designed to function as an implementing organization and was
also highly unusual in its make-up of having strong governmental representation. The Trust rather
had a mandate to source and channel financial and technical assistance to the Department of
Forestry and other organizations that were directly responsible for management of the mountain’s
environment and natural resources. Now the challenge was to source the support so desperately
required.

2.3 Implementation of the Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project.

During the period of MMCT establishment, the World Bank had expressed interest to support
conservation work on Mt Mulanje specifically with assistance from the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF) established after the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. With support from GEF and the
British Government Department for International Development, a concerted pre-feasibility study
was carried out over two years in the late 1990’s to ascertain the situation on and around Mt
Mulanje and a full project proposal was then developed for GEF consideration.

Through the project developmental process, it became apparent that the newly established MMCT
provided an ideal organizational vehicle within which to host the operational support that the
MMFR required. This proposal titled the ‘Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project’

received GEF Council approval and after processing the necessary administrative preparations the
project was initiated on 1st September 2002 (refer to Appendix 1).

Unlike most World Bank projects that were operationalised through a project implementation unit
or project office, this GEF project was to be implemented by an independent agency. With the
broad representation of government departments and agencies on the MMCT Board of Governors,
the government was comfortable with this implementation arrangement. The GEF project was
contracted by a Project Agreement between World Bank and the Malawi Government, a
Subsidiary Agreement between the Malawi Government and MMCT, and a Trust Fund Agreement
between MMCT and the World Bank.

The first phase of the project sought to test MMCT as a viable agency to disburse the necessary
financial and technical support for addressing the key MMFR threats. This phase was evaluated
as positive and the endowment funding of US$5.45m was released to MMCT in April 2005. As of
July 1st 2005, MMCT has been functioning on draw-downs on the endowment. The available funds
were not comparative to the project period expenditure where MMCT had also been largely
supporting all MMFR management costs in the absence of any treasury funding to the Department
of Forestry district offices. This funding constraint sharply decreased the scale of field activities.

As a mitigating measure, a series of proposals were generated for donor financing primarily of a
wide range of livelihood projects and these have now largely been approved. MMCT provides an
ideal agency for project financing with the core administrative costs being covered and a well
qualified and experienced management team available for facilitation. Other donor support for
MMFR and surrounding area activities has now been received from European Union, USAID,
Dle, Irish Aid, Beit Trust, Scotland, Malawi Environmental Endowment Trust, EarthWatch, Coca
Cola Foundation and others. This support has principally enabled a range of highly qualified and
experienced local and international organizational partners to become involved in the holistic
approach to the mountain’s management.

3. Justification for the Proposal.
3.1 A Globally Unique Site.

Mt Mulanje is the most significant mountain in southern tropical Africa. This montane environment
may be small in size and isolated but it is a physically impressive geomorphologic feature. The
mountain hosts over 250 unique species of plant and animal life that are not found anywhere else
internationally. These plants and animals are therefore of global significance. There exists a clear
and common understanding of the principal challenges that are threatening the ecological habitats
and a renewal of effort to address these is appropriate.

The ecology and biodiversity of Mt Mulanje has gained significant international recognition. This
status came early with numerous scientific expeditions from prestigious academic and research
institutions exploring the montane environment. IUCN proclaimed Mulanje a International Centre
of Plant Diversity, UNESCO granted Global Biosphere Reserve status and Conservation
International has included the mountain in the Eastern Afro-Montane Biodiversity Hotspot. Of
particular importance is the current process with technical support from UNESCO and funding
from the Spanish Government, to pipeline Mt Mulanje for World Heritage Site status consideration
within 2008.

Whilst the mountain has the protected area status of a Forest Reserve, this is primarily intended to
protect the forest resource and as a result most of the endemic species unique to the mountain do
not receive any special conservation attention despite the fact that this represents Malawi’s most
significant terrestrial endemicity. The Department of Forestry largely also has a production bias
and is not oriented towards ecological management. Forestry policy and legislation only
recognizes one form of protected area status, and so there is no priority profiling within the
government estate of over eighty forest reserves. This is unlike the wildlife sector where a two tier
system exists with national park areas receiving priority attention and wildlife reserves receiving
lower status. Unless there is a change in approach it is unlikely that Mulanje will receive the
attention it deserves with its resident unique ecology and endemic biodiversity. There will
hopefully be an opportunity to redress this at the next policy review.

The current national budget priorities are all focused upon provision of social services and the
management of natural resources receives low level support. The Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity
Conservation Project was established by three separate contractual agreements and a
commitment of increased budgetary support to Mulanje for capital and operational funding was
agreed to. That support was calculated to be MK2.6m on an annual basis but this commitment
has unfortunately never been forthcoming. As a result, the Trust has to realize the additional
funds to address the un-financed costs affected by this shortfall.

3.3 Defining a Collaborative Future Management Framework.

The MMBCP partners’ joint mid term review acknowledged that although aspects of project
implementation were showing positive results, there could be no sustainable improvements at
MMFR until the management situation was redressed. FD stated that the Memorandum of
Understanding was too loose an arrangement to effectively work and the recommendation was to
move towards developing a more comprehensive application of the public private partnership
model to seek a solution.

The process of developing the public private partnership contractual arrangement is well
developed with the MMCT Board of Governors, FD, World Bank and local MMFR stakeholders
having had the opportunity to offer their advise and support, and this has been legally reviewed
and drafted into a contract document. It is anticipated that the arrangement should be finalized
shortly and then there is a need to pursue the agreed mid-term review action plan to complete the
MMFR management planning and MMCT strategic planning processes, establish the working
regime and source the seconded FD staff, and establish the mechanisms for accommodating
other key stakeholders into the management arrangement. A fundamental understanding to this
change is that the financial commitment exists to capacitate the process now.

4. The MMCT Endowment at the C_urrent Prechament.

MMCT was capitalized with an endowment fund of USD5.45million in April 2005 and this is
currently managed in a highly professional manner by UBS, the global investment banking leader.
The investments policy of the Trust seeks a 7.5% return on investment, with 2% reinvested to
counter inflation and a 5.5% drawn-down to finance operations of MMCT and mountain
management activities. The endowment has grown by financial year end June 30th 2007 to
US$6,28m which represents an extraordinary increase enabled by a strong bull market over the
past year. The 2007 June 30th year-end fund statement in Annex 3 comprehensively details the
overall endowment performance to date, which can only de described as exceptional.

However, the current endowment draw-down rate cannot satisfy the current budget requirements
with the unanticipated additional demand to accommodate for standard forestry management
interventions that were supposed to be covered by recurrent government expenditure. The
pressure on government to focus budgetary finance on social priorities to the alienation of
integrated environmental management expenditure realizes the fact that this global treasure is
extremely vulnerable unless a concerted effort is taken at an international level to provide for
holistic support.

There is a crucial need to enable this endowment model to function adequately by seeking a
substantial increase in capital that will in turn provide in future the desired income stream. The
endowment based environmental action model is an exciting new sustainable financing innovation
that is realizing significant conservation gains internationally but it is reliant on a realistic initial
capital investment. There are two options available, either an increase to the capital of an
appropriate amount or the alternative funding of the primary costs so that the draw-down rate is
sharply reduced to enable substantial reinvestment. The World Bank / Global Environmental
Facility are not in a position to add an additional amount and the process of attracting bilateral
partners to contribute capital is also prolonged. To seek support for funding annual expenditure
appears more viable as an immediate prospect.

Determining the appropriate future draw-down amount cannot be accurately assessed as there are
many key factors to consider that are outside of MMCT control. However, there is an experience
of supporting core mountain management costs that can give some indication as to the
requirement. Based upon that experience, the anticipated broader partnership commitment and
the understanding that with ongoing concerted efforts some current costs will reduce in the short-
term future, an annual budget of US$450,000 could be deemed ideal. To generate this on a 5.5%
draw-down basis there would be a need to have an endowment base of US$8.0m. Should the
endowment reinvestment be enabled on the compounding factor of 7.5% return on investment,
this ideal total would be attained in a period of just 4 years. However, although a rate of return of
7.5% has been achievable over the past three years, there can be no guarantee that this trend
shall continue as such. Based upon a current endowment value of US$6million and a 7.5%
compounding return, the potential endowment growth can be seen as follows:

 

Endowment Anticipated Endowment
Year Start Value Rate of Return End Value

2007 — 2008 US$ 6,000,000 UD$ 250,000 US$ 6,250,000

 

 

2008 — 2009 US$ 6,250,000 US$ 468,750 US$ 6,718,750

 

2009 — 2010 US$ 6,718,750 US$ 503,906 US$ 7,222,656

 

2010 — 2011 US$ 7,222,656 US$ 541,699 US$ 7,764,355

 

2011 — 2012 US$ 7,764,355 US$ 582,326 US$ 8,346,668

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Proposed Action.

The proposed action will renew the efforts to achieve the stated Project Appraisal Document
objectives necessary to be implemented for the ecological well-being of the mountain environment.
These supported interventions will counter the principal threats facing the conservation of the
globally important endemic biodiversity on the mountain. As specified in the Detailed Project
Description (Appendix 2), the phase II after the mid-term review would significantly renew the
efforts to address the core priorities as determined by the initial MMBCP design. These priorities
described in summary below shall be implemented through the three MMCT programmes based
upon the work-plans detailed in Appendix 3 and the budget in Annex 1. The Royal Norwegian
Embassy support would enable this fundamental core work to be achieved.

The MMCT is based upon a model functional upon a sustainable financing mechanism. Due to
the negligible financial contributions by government to the Department of Forestry, the cost to
MMCT for ensuring implantation of activities has exceeded the original budgets and therefore
places a heavier than anticipated demand on the endowment income stream. To consolidate the
viability of the endowment model, there is a need for additional donor finance to directly support
priority administrative and programme actions, to enable the endowment capital growth to be
compounded by the generated returns.

5.1 The key management interventions that are proposed to be supported are:

5.1.1 Eradication of invasive alien plants. There is an urgent need to renew the efforts to clear
the invasive alien plants that are displacing the native vegetation. To date, support from MMCT
has enabled the eradication of about half the rogue pine forests on the mountain which has
realized successes such as the total elimination of the Sombani pine plantation. The Chambe
plantation of over 800 hectares has been reduced by half and as this had little silvicultural
management, the remainder has minimal economic value and should also be destroyed as a
matter of urgency. With the distortion caused to the soil chemistry and structure by the pines,
there is need to carefully manage these areas so that re-growth of seedlings does not succeed.
To complete the pine eradication exercise, there is also a need to destroy a number of
inaccessible pine patches and isolated trees on the rock slabs of some of the peaks. In addition,
there are a range of other invasive plants that require attention soon. These include the
Himalayan raspberry, bracken fern and cypress on the mountain heights and others on the lower
slopes that are steadily penetrating the boundary areas.

5.1.2 Fire prevention. Fire is the most natural destructive force that negatively impacts this
environment. The management authority has put in place an extensive firebreak network that
prevents the extensive spread of fire across the mountain. Fires originate in many different ways
but the ones purposely set on the heights are particularly destructive of the cedar forest patches.
There is a need to continue to improve the systems to both the pre-emptive measures and the
response action. Priority forest areas should receive higher prevention attention. MMCT and the
Department of Forestry have to refine the fire-fighting early warning procedures and mechanisms,
and develop the capacity to retaliate against fires on a timely basis. This requires establishing
standby team accommodation, better communications, appropriate equipment, and a better
trained work-force.

5.1.3 Mountain infrastructure. There is a need to improve the accommodation on the mountain
for the workers who carry out management work to eradicate aliens, clear firebreaks, replant and
carry out law enforcement. The mountain is a difficult working environment as it is very wet during
the rains and then has cold temperatures in the dry season. It is proposed to renovate and
construct new accommodation at appropriate points around the mountain.

5.1.4 Law enforcement. Natural resource management worldwide requires regulation, monitoring
and enforcement action to ensure sustainable use. Mt Mulanje is no exception and this capacity
has been established in the past but due to capacity and corruption problems, has not been
utilized in an adequate manner. There is a need to organize and equip this capacity efficiently,
and to plan its application more effectively to deter the illegal elements on the mountain that deny

a broader community use of the resources. The approach is also to increase local modalities such
as community policies.

5.1.5 Environmental education and communication. There will be a concerted campaign
launched to involve and inform all local leaders and the broader public about the process of
seeking to establish a wider stakeholder based management arrangement for the MMFR. It is
critically important that an understanding exists that the management has not been handed over to
MMCT but has in effect been transferred to a partnership arrangement that more positively
enables the involvement of local stakeholders. A campaign strategy shall be developed to guide
this awareness. Additionally, a key aspect of the conservation work here is to generate an aware
and educated population that understands the ecology of the mountain, the potential of what
sustainable resource use allows, and the action that is required to maintain this responsibility.
MMCT manages a programme that specifically works to achieve this. Awareness is required to be
more focused on the key issues to inform better decision-making and enable change towards
more sustainable solutions.

5.1.6 Reforestation. The clearance of pine plantations and the chance to expand existing
indigenous forest patches creates the opportunity for the replanting of endemic tree species such
as Mulanje cedar upon the mountain heights. This is crucial to securing and expanding those
unique high altitude habitats where the endemic biodiversity is threatened. The exotic plantations
around the lower slopes of the mountain were of significant importance to the timber industry of
the southern region of the country. However, once again these have largely deteriorated and
there is a need to prepare to reforest these areas so that can be productive and contribute
financially in future towards the overall management of the mountain.

5.1.7 Administrative cost support. To reduce the draw-down impact on the endowment capital,
it is appropriate to finance the administrative overhead of MMCT. This is the current core aspect
of financing from the endowment’s return on the investment.

5.1.8 Management authority capacity improvement. The Department of Forestry has a
mandated role to manage the mountains forest resources but the capacity of the district offices
prohibits this responsibility from being adequately executed. MMCT continues to support the
steady improvement of facilities, skills and operational costs. There would be an approach to
improve the current situation based upon the priority needs of the district staff within the context of
improving the direct management capacity.

5.1.9 MMCT capacity improvement. The recent period has seen MMCT channeling its
available limited income to supporting the management action required on the mountain. The
financial constraint experienced has prohibited the procurement of replacement capital items to
capacitate the normal functioning of the MMCT. There is a need to replenish transport,
communications and field equipment that has had heavy use over the past five years.
Additionally, there is a need to expand the offices in anticipation of the broader management
arrangement currently under discussion.

5.1.10 FD & MMCT Infrastructural support. In order to host the anticipated additional capacity
and other organizations expected with the implementation of a broader management situation,
there is a need to expand and renovate office accommodation around the mountain to cater for
this. The existing office capacity of the Department of Forestry and MMCT will be improved at
Mulanje Boma, Likhubula valley, Fort Lister, Eastern Outer Slopes and Nanchidwe.

6. Implementation Arrangement.
6.1 MMCT Operational Capacity

MMCT has been designed as an effective and efficient support facilitation organization, offering a
project management service at a limited administrative overhead cost and the availability of a well
managed professionally staffed agency. The MMCT management team was designed to be small
in number, highly qualified and cost effective. Support is rendered through the three priority
programme areas of biodiversity conservation, community collaboration and environmental
education to assist a range of other implementation agencies carry out the work on the ground.

This proposal is seeking support to enable MMCT to adequately cater for their core administrative
costs, mainstream management activities and continued capacity building assistance. As such
this core project support shall be implemented through the standard organizational approach and
procedures that the MMCT operates within.

In order to address the priority challenges realized by the mid-term review, there is planned a more
comprehensive approach through the development of a broader public private partnership
management arrangement. This in the first place shall consolidate the complimentary capacities
of the Department of Forestry within a newly defined MMCT capacity, and thereafter incorporate
the management mandates and skills of other stakeholder government departments and technical
service agencies. This consolidation of a broader range of working professionals will enable the
more holistic adoption of the PPP model within MMCT that exists at governance level to be
extended to the working management level.

MMCT has the principal role of channeling financial and technical resources to the most
appropriate organizations or associations available in the local area whom can implement the
required work. That was the original design modality for the organization, one where the capacity
and operational effectiveness of a wide range of local organizations is financially enhanced to
achieve improved mountain management. This approach should ensure that there is consistent
work effort, that no one individual agency is over-extended, and that relevant capacity can be
steadily improved.

The work of MMCT is based principally guided by the project appraisal document of the Mulanje
Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project. The legal contracts that determine execution of this
project are the Project Agreement signed between the World Bank and the Malawi Government,
the Subsidiary Agreement between the Malawi Government and the MMCT, and the Trust Fund
Agreement between the World Bank and MMCT. Within the recent mid-term review, MMCT has
made a commitment to support the process of developing the new MMFR management plan for
the period 2007 to 2012 and based upon this, to redesign a strategic plan for MMCT for the same
period. The MMFR management and MMCT strategic planning processes are broadly
consultative in nature to address the interests and issues at stake, and to incorporate the
commitments of potential working partners in the operational activities.

The mandated management of the mountain lies with the Department of Forestry, an organization
that at district level has very limited capacity and motivation. The challenge is to explore the
policy-enabling collaborative management arrangements to develop a broader participation and
sector- based management system that works for the dynamic situation. The increased frequency
of corruption experienced within the department also needs to be pro-actively tackled in order to
renew the public respect of this organization as a viable management organization.

The relationship between the Department of Forestry and MMCT to-date was previously
established through a memorandum of understanding, although this emerged as a one-sided
partnership with the incapacity of the department. The process of collaboration works on the basis
of the management plan whereupon annual work-plan and budget are jointly developed, and then
the subsequent quarterly work-plans are fine-tuned at meetings dependent upon prior reports of
period progress and the particular seasonal activities scheduled. This routine has in practice been
erratic due to the staff turnaround within the Department of Forestry but there is good reason to
now expect the re-establishment of this routine.

Following the mid-term review, there is a dynamic process ongoing to develop a more holistic
private-public partnership management arrangement for Mt Mulanje. Regardless of the eventual
manifestation of this process, there is a very clear need currently for a much broader arrangement
to prevent the negative impacts that are now taking effect without any controls. This PPP model
has now partially started at management level with the seconding of a staff person from the
Ministry of Tourism to assist the operations of InfoMulanje, the availability of a plant taxonomist
from National Herbarium & Botanic Gardens, and experts from a variety of other national and
international agencies.

The approach of MMCT and the current Forestry Policy is to broaden local district and community
involvement in the holistic approach to Mt Mulanje management. The approach seeks to expand
community based co-management arrangements, the formalization and regulation of resource
user groups, the investment by commercial sector in viable business, the collaboration of
neighbouring landowners in joint ventures, an increase in local NGO and CBO action to address
social priorities, and the participation of district government in development action.

This potential support will enable a new opportunity for MMCT to understand, adopt and engage
the mainstreaming of key issues to address gender and HIV & AIDS impact considerations.
MMCT itself has accommodated leading edge thinking towards HIV & AIDS within the office
situation, but there is a need to contract expertise to advise upon the mainstreaming of these
issues within the work and approaches undertaken by the wide range of partner agencies.

6.2 Additional donor support.

MMCT directly and indirectly solicits funding support for a wide range of projects on and around
the mountain. These projects do not necessarily finance core MMCT responsibilities but they do
develop aspects of the mountain’s potential that compliment the whole picture and do respond to a
local stakeholder’s expressed need. MMCT lends itself as an agency to give confidence to
potential donors either by providing a financial management service, project implementation
oversight or a simple monitoring role.

Mkhumba Boundarv Livelihoods Improvement Proiect: This project combines the technical skills
of two other non-governmental organizations, namely the food security services of Concern
Universal and the community based natural resource management ability of the Wildlife &
Environmental Society of Malawi, together with a monitoring capacity from MMCT. Based at the
Phalombe boma, the project with a staffing of twelve introduces new livelihood skills and strives to
motivate local organizations and commerce to support improved community livelihood activities.
The €1.2million project is financed by European Union and Irish Aid.

Chisonqoli Watershed Partnership Proiect: This is a local agency partnership project focusing on
mountain water management activities that is being financed initially by a US$250,000 USAID
Coca Cola award through the services of the USAID DAI COMPASS II project. It is hosted at
MMCT with a contracted project coordinator and administrative assistant

GTZ Forum for Dialogue & Peace - Encroachment Reduction Process. MMCT working with GTZ
support through the collaboration of local community leaders and the encroachers themselves, are
reducing the settlement and agricultural encroachment impacts within the MMFR.

Biodiversity Monitoring of Mozambican Mountains in South East Africa: This three year £295,000
joint Kew Royal Botanical Gardens / MMCT project financed by the prestigious UK government
Darwin Initiative is based at MMCT in Mulanje. Across the border, are a number of unknown
mountain environments with an eco-system comparative to Mt Mulanje and a range of UK based,
Mozambican and Malawian expert agencies are exploring these areas to understand their ecology
and resident biodiversity. The project has been staffed by experts, a biodiversity monitoring
specialist and a highly experienced field plant taxonomist, and these two and other visiting
scientists also give generously of their time to Mt Mulanje

 

 

E-Mindset & Micro-hydro Power Development Proiect: These two energy focused projects seek to
build the local capacity of organizations at district-level to develop initiatives to sustainably provide

11

for the future needs. These are both multi-million Euro projects spearheaded by Practical Action
(formerly the Intermediate Technology Development Group ITDG) that focus on three countries in
the region and Mulanje is the Malawian site and MMCT is the local partner.

Mt Mulanie Tourism Support Proiect: This Beit Trust US$60,000 funding will be channeled
through MMCT to support the priority needs and improved standards of the membership of the
Tourism Association of Mount Mulanje and the Mulanje Tour Guides & Porters Association.

EarthWatch Ecological Monitoring Support: Financial and technical support has been made
available on the on-going basis from the international ecological expertise agency EarthWatch
towards the operationalising the MMFR ecological monitoring programme. This project enables
visits from numerous international experts to work alongside staff from mandated local agencies to
build their knowledge within the MMFR context.

 

Additional proposals are currently in negotiation to seek support for the development of the
potential smallholder production locally to the Mulanje Peak Foods processing factory, develop the
establishment of skills training centres at existing facilities around the mountain with Scottish
support, and the integration of local neighbouring community interests in the economic
development, livelihood use, and routine management activities on the mountain with committed
French GEF support of €1 .6million.

7. Sustainabilitv & the Mitigation of Risks.

The primary risks to project achievement are lack of cooperation from the management authority,
the prevalence of corruption frustrating the establishment of sustainable natural resource use, and
conflict with the mountain’s neighbouring communities. An additional risk is the impact of the
urban demand for resources upon MMFR with the recent development of good quality access
roads in the area.

The standard expression of concern on the sustainability of a project’s implemented activities has
been addressed within the specific design of MMCT as an endowment based institution and the
core involvement of stakeholders within the execution of activities. The unique aspect of the
MMCT model is that its endowment will ensure a sustained flow of funds towards the defined
MMFR priorities. There is a need to apply support initially to reduce and where possible eliminate
the prevalence of threats and therefore reduce the required costs, and then to focus the funding on
enabling local capacity and benefit sharing regimes.

The proposed public private partnership management arrangement is being developed chiefly to
address the difficulties experienced to date within the project by consolidating MMFR management
capacity under one roof. The improvements being sought with this stronger FD cooperation are a
comprehensive planning and reporting system, efficient supervision of management interventions
on the MMFR, management being effected by professional and motivated staff, the application of
effective law enforcement against illegal activities, and the incorporation of more diverse resource
management expertise.

A key aspect of MMFR management to be analysed and adapted is that of ensuring that activities
are carried out by organizations and groups that have a core-business and appropriate capacity to
do so. Conflict arises with neighbouring organizations, groups and communities when they are
denied access and involvement in management, economic and livelihood benefit activities. The
approach of MMCT has been to broadly enable the participation of all stakeholders and to work
with them to engender a regime of care and responsibility over the resources.

The immediate way fonNard is to finalise the partnership contract currently at hand and then to
move forward to define a more dynamic MMFR Management Plan and then determine a broader
strategic plan for MMCT within the short-term. The development of these key guidance
instruments will involve a process of broad national and local consultation, and this has already
been initiated. MMCT does have extensive goodwill through its approach of cooperation and
consultation to-date, and so the synergy of closer collaboration is attainable as a logical next step.

Corruption has unfortunately manifested itself within the sector as a whole and also on MMFR. A
concerted effort is required to address this that will originate from the motivations of political,
traditional, faith and business leadership around the mountain. Direct assistance will be sought
from the local police and judiciary through the formation of a forum to oversee all law enforcement
and justice activities. The consolidation of motivated professional FD management staff within
MMCT to direct law enforcement and operational activities shall greatly assist to displace those
with corrupt tendencies. As has been done recently, with the assistance of an extensive informer
network, those FD staff directly involved in corrupt activities will be reported to their leadership for
disciplinary action. Local illegal activities will be addressed through a new initiative to assist the
development of local community policing capacity that has proved to achieve results in other
sectors.

13

8. Reporting. Monitoring & Evaluation Systems.

MMCT is steadily developing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system that reports on
the progress of MMFR activities that will accurately assist the dynamic response from MMCT.
This is based upon the Performance Monitoring System table in Appendix 4. The system is based
upon a variety of methodologies from the usual reporting responsibilities within that monitoring
framework to a sophisticated geographical information system based monitoring programme that
captures both ecological and social data. Whilst some indicators are regularly and effectively
tracked, there remains a challenge to source accurate data to report on other activities such as
those reported on Department of Forestry responsibilities. The design of an innovative
participatory socio-economic monitoring system has recently been finalized by the MMCT
Monitoring & Evaluation Officer with support from the EU.

MMCT has many levels of monitoring on-going. The financial support extended to other
organizations to implement action is reported upon regularly by the recipients and verified by the
responsible programme officer. On a monthly basis, the achievements and constraints are
reported at an organizational management level, and then consolidated to report progress against
the prevailing work-plans on a quarterly basis to the Board of Governors. Prior to the Governor’s
meeting, the Finance & Administration Sub-Committee reviews quarterly expenditure and then
analyses the plans and budgets for the coming quarter. The Board meeting focuses on ensuring
that the activity being undertaken to achieve objectives is meeting targets and if not will direct
courses of action for this to be done. A final comprehensive quarterly report is then compiled
inclusive of the minutes of the Board meeting, which is then circulated to appropriate Government
Ministries, World Bank offices, UNESCO and the key donors to MMCT. This will be the principal
means of regular reporting that is anticipated to be submitted to the Royal Norwegian Embassy.

The various projects and organizational developments that MMCT collaborates with, involves the
organization in a variety of roles that oversee project guidance and/or management. Some of
these relationships are contracted, some are informal regular committee responsibilities, and other
positions are appointed by forums where MMCT is seen to have expertise or responsibility that is
of direct relevance.

Despite MMCT having broad representation within its governance, there is a need to present to a
public forum the progress achieved on a regular basis and to this end an annual stakeholders
meeting is hosted at the end of the third quarter each year. At this open forum, the chairperson
and executive director give detailed annual reports, a printed comprehensive annual report is
circulated and the financial expenditure statements for the prior annual period are presented by
the auditors. MMCT is audited annually to special World Bank standards by the accounting firm
Graham Carr & Co and a management report is also generated to advise improvements to
financial management and administration procedures.

MMCT, though an independent institution, operates within the context of a World Bank supported
Malawi Government project. A project inception report was completed and more recently, a mid-
term review was completed to ascertain the progress achieved against the project indicators. On
a regular basis, supervision missions visit MMCT to ascertain project progress and financial
discipline. The evaluation analysis of these missions involves the Department of Forestry, Ministry
of Energy & Mining, Ministry of Finance, and all levels of the MMCT organization. The aide-
memoirs generated from these missions provide to the key agencies involved a regular
understanding of progress and issues at all levels of project implementation.

9. Financial Support Reguest.

The requested funding support will specifically cater for the principal MMCT expenditure for priority

MMFR management activities anticipated over the next year. This financing will realize

a

significantly lower MMCT draw-down requirement on the endowment fund as the Trust would

anticipate covering costs from financial year-start July 15‘ until the flow of this requested support
received.

The proposal seeks funding for the following cost centres for the period 2007 — 2008:

 

Budget Item US$
Programme Activities:
a) Invasive species eradication 127,650
b) Fire management activities 73,500
0) Mountain infrastructure 10,000
d) Law enforcement 69,500
e) Environmental education 37,500
f) Forestry resource management 80,500
Administrative Costs:
g) MMCT administration to June 30‘“ 08 162,300
July 15‘ - Dec 315‘ 08 112,700
h) MMCT capacity increase 150,500
i) New infrastructure 85,000
Total funds requested US$ 909,150

Refer to Annex 1 for more detailed breakdown per cost centre.

is

Budgeted amounts above may not accurately correlate to the sub-total amounts specified in the
attached working annual budget, as this does detail anticipated expenditure in the MMCT financial
period July 15‘ 2007 to June 30‘“ 2008 and the above proposed support is potentially expected
towards the end of 2007. MMCT endowment funds reinvestment will be limited this year 2007 -
2008 to about US$250,000 as MMCT will finance administrative and projects costs for the period

until Norwegian funds start flowing.

MMCT as the implementation agency for the MMBCP has duty-free status on vehicles and other
key imported assets. MMCT also retrospectively claims surtax refunds on purchases made from
the Malawi Revenue Authority.

Appendix 2: Detailed Project Description.

The project has five major components (including capitalization of the endowment itself) which will
benefit from GEF financing. Each component will provide the necessary technical and financial
assistance to develop institutional and management capacity within MMCT, within the Forestry
Department and, through the Program Officers and collaborating NGOs, within the local
communities.

The following provides a more detailed description of the financing structure of the project, i.e. the
objectives and activities of Phase I and Phase II, as well as the preparatory phase which was
financed partly by the GEF and partly by DFID and others:

2.1 Preparatory Phase: Activities to establish the MMBCP project were undertaken. The
expenditures reflected in the budget for this (US$300,000 from GEF plus an equivalent amount
from DFID, University of Malawi, National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Malawi, and the
Wildlife & Environmental Society of Malawi) generally represent one-time, ground-laying costs
including technical support. During the preparation period, the MMCT Board of Governors, with
the assistance of a program coordinator and contracted specialists, developed an investment
strategy and guidelines, prepared a proposal for selecting an asset manager and establishing
financial audit and control systems to international standards. Other preparation activities
included: (1) completion of an administration manual to define/clarify procedures and operations
for the MMCT and its bodies; (2) formalization of cooperative working relationships with key
national and local governmental entities; (3) studies including community consultation and
participation, forest productivity, timber utilization, non-timber forest products, ecotourism, and
institutional development and organizational strengthening. These studies were undertaken to
support the preparation of the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve Management Plan and were
financed primarily by DFID.

The consultative preparation of the management plan, the first one for MMFR, included the
following activities:

0 identification of the significant biological resources of Mulanje Mountain and the threats and
trends on these resources;

0 development of appropriate management objectives from information collected;
0 development of strategies for habitat management, including a proposed zoning plan;

0 development of a proposed implementation program involving activities such as pilot co-
management projects, environmental education, livelihood enhancement, ecological
research and monitoring, essential infrastructure and equipment for FD, and strengthening
FD management capacity and external relations.

2.2 Phase I Project Financing: Phase I of the MMBCP project has supported capacity building
activities at various levels to develop and strengthen an enabling environment for project
implementation. Some important aspects of implementation that took place include the completion
of the Environmental Monitoring Programme and several baseline data collections under the
biodiversity component and the facilitation of a number of pilot projects under the forest co-
management and livelihoods component. The budget for phase one totaled US$1.25 million.
Phase I commenced later than expected with a project effective date of September 1 2002 and
was completed in three years. The following activities were undertaken:

0 Trust Administration: this activity included procurement of office accommodation, staffing
and training. Project offices were rented during the first two years, and in the third year the
construction of offices was completed. The staff members recruited were the Executive
Director, three Programme Officers, an Accountant, a Secretary and support staff. The
administrative arrangements for the implementation of the project will also be established
under this component, including the finalization of criteria for disbursing and supervising
sub-grants to the FD and collaborating NGOs as approved by the Board. The
administration manual will provide guidelines for all MMCT procedures. Training activities

2

were provided to the Board, management team and the FD staff with the skills needed for
implementation of the project.

0 Biodiversity Conservation, Research and Monitoring: During Phase I, the emphasis will be
on development of capacity, strategies and action plans, and implementation of some
urgent actions on the ground. Activities will include: recruitment of the MMCT Biodiversity
Programme Officer; carrying out a detailed baseline biodiversity and ecosystem survey
and development of a practical long-term monitoring plan, including indicators and methods
of data collection and analysis; implementation of urgent conservation actions identified in
the Reserve Management Plan (e.g., maintenance of boundaries and firebreaks, clearing
of exotic plants at priority sites, improved patrols, etc.); in collaboration with the FRlM and
other local partners, developing a research strategy focused on generating the information
and tools needed to improve biodiversity conservation and management in the Reserve.

0 Environmental Education and Communications: The Environmental Education and
Communications Programme Officer will develop and implement an environmental
education and communication program in collaboration with other stakeholders.

0 Forest Co-manaqement and Sustainable Livelihoods: Studies undertaken during project
preparation indicated both the need for greater community participation in the management
and benefits of the Reserve, and the difficulty of achieving this given the weak local
institutional capacity and structures to support collective decision making and action.
Implementation of the Government’s co-management policy is also constrained by limited
capacity within the Forestry Department, at national, district and local levels. In view of
this, the priority during Phase I will be to recruit the MMCT Forest Co-management and
Livelihoods Programme Officer, who will then identify specific needs and opportunities and
develop a strategy for supporting communities and the FD in these areas, to complement
work being carried out under other Government and donor-support programs. The strategy
will involve MMCT supporting local implementation partners, who will work with local area
institutions such as the Village Natural Resources Committees and/or resource-oriented
user groups. A few target groups and areas/resources will be selected for intensive
support, including the initiation of pilot co-management activities by Year 3. These pilot
areas should be linked as directly as possible with improving the management of
biodiversity resources which are currently under substantial threat. In order to demonstrate
immediate, concrete benefits of MMCT to local stakeholders, the Co-Management and
Livelihoods Program Officer will work with the Biodiversity Program Officer and the FD to
ensure that implementation of direct conservation activities generates as much local
employment as possible.

0 Establishment of the Endowment Fund and fund-raising: During Phase I, the MMCT will
put in place the necessary legal and institutional instruments for establishing an
Endowment Fund. The Management Team (with assistance from the World Bank) will
actively seek donors, such as the Norwegian Government, and contributors to complement
the GEF contribution to the MMCT. Once the agreement is made that GEF funds for the
endowment will be released (based on agreed “readiness” indicators), MMCT will contract
a professional asset manager and approve a low risk broad-based investment strategy.

 

Indicators that informed project implementation that Phase I had been successfully completed and
that Phase II could be initiated included the following: (i) successful establishment and functioning
of the management team; (ii) establishment and functioning of the Board of Governors; (iii)
completion and initial implementation of the MMFR Management Plan; (iv) development and
launching of a fund raising strategy; (v) demonstration of adequate FD presence and activity on
the mountain; (vi) adequate allocation of operating funds by Government of Malawi to FD and by
FD to MMFR and that (vii) adequate progress had been made towards restructuring the FD.

2.3 Phase II MMCT Endowment Financing: The duration of Phase Two of the project will
represent the period during which the World Bank will actively supervise MMCT project
implementation after receipt and investment of the endowment funding. This is the current project
phase for which financial support is being sought for implementation of activities through this

proposal. In fact, however, “Phase II” continues in perpetuity, as the annual investment income
from the endowment fund (estimated at the outset at US$300,000-350,000 per year) is utilized to
maintain the MMCT and implement its core activities, as follows:

0 Trust administration and support functions. Income from the Trust will support general
administration, financial asset management, outreach and external relations (local, national
and international), fundraising, and institutional overheads. Emphasis will be on achieving
the minimum ratio of administrative costs to program costs that is compatible with good
governance and achieving the Trust’s objectives;

0 Continuation and Expansion of Core Program Activities. Income from the Trust will support
the continuation of the three core operational programs (Biodiversity Conservation,
Monitoring and Research; Forest Co-Management and Sustainable Livelihoods; and
Environmental Education and Communication). These programmes will be continued,
modified, reduced or expanded, based on the information and experience gained in Phase
I. The proposed Norwegian support shall enable this expansion of activities to take place.
It is expected that:

o the nature of direct biodiversity conservation activities should evolve from urgent
protection towards maintenance and restoration, and from species and site-specific
intervention to broader ecological management. Research and monitoring activities will
also emphasize support for and evaluation of management practices and strategies;

0 the pilot co-management and livelihoods program will be expanded to broader
geographic/community coverage and greater diversity of activities; and

o the environmental education and communications program will move from a focus on
identifying and delivering key messages to target audiences through MMCT activities,
towards institutionalizing the messages within existing educational and media
structures for ongoing impact.

For all programs, as for the MMCT overall, an adaptive management approach will be used to
ensure that information from internal monitoring and evaluation and from independent reviews is
fed back to decision-making processes. Key indicators of success vs. need for change will be
improvements in biodiversity and ecosystem status and trends and reduction in threats, and
stakeholder satisfaction as expressed through the annual stakeholder forum and formal and
informal opinion surveys. Depending on needs identified and funds available, additional capital
investments may be considered (e.g., an EE Centre or other infrastructure).

The GEF Grant Agreement will specify that the income from the GEF investment will continue to
support the incremental cost of activities that directly enhance biodiversity protection, including
both direct conservation activities and assistance for development of environmentally compatible
alternative livelihoods for rural populations who would otherwise bear the opportunity costs of
enhanced biodiversity protection. The GEF grant therefore will not substitute for, but will remain
complementary to, continuing support from GOM, DFID and others to meet the ongoing costs of
meeting sustainable development objectives such as improving management of the reserve and
its surroundings as a forestry resource and watershed, general institutional strengthening for forest
management, and improving land use and management practices within the project area.

NOTE: It should be appreciated that for the past two years, Forest Protection (which includes Firebreak maintenance, fire fighting/control, forest patrols etc) have not

been funded adequately resulting into serious fires. Invasive species eradication has also stalled because of non-availability of funds. These are key activities
