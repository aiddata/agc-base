Dear Sir,

RE: MWI-07/017 NORWAY — SUPPORT TO NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE (NAO)
Reference is made to your letter dated 9th November 2009 giving the Ministry’s consent to the
Draft Agreement for ﬁnancial support for Institutional Strengthening of National Audit Ofﬁce
(NAO) in cooperation with the Ofﬁce of the Auditor General in Norway (OAGN).

Please ﬁnd enclosed the ﬁnal agreement for the ﬁnancial grant not exceeding NOK 18 million
for the period 2009/ 10 — 2011/12, ready for signing.

May we kindly request the Ministry to explore the possibility for arranging a short signing

be present.

We look forward to your reply.
Yours sincerely,
