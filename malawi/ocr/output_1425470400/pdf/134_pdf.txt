Sugar Fortification Proposal 2010-2015 Page 1

 

 

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) has been a public health concern for many years in Malawi.
Results from the 2001 Micronutrient Survey indicated that the level of VAD in the country
was 57% based on the prevalence among women. The prevalence among under-five
children was 60%. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines VAD in a population as
moderate if the prevalence is 10-20% and severe when the prevalence is more than 20%. In
order to address this situation the Government of Malawi and lllovo Sugar Malawi Limited,
have long been discussing the possibility of fortifying sugar in with Vitamin A. An agreement
has now been reached and the program is to be implemented based on terms stipulated in a
Memorandum of Understanding2 between the Malawi Government and lllovo that was
signed at the end of September 2010. The Malawi National Nutrition Policy and Strategic
Plan (NNPSP) which was launched early 2010 also identifies the prevention and control of

micronutrient deﬁciency disorders as a key priority area of action with emphasis on Vitamin
A Deficiency, anemia and Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD).
Since the late 1990’s many meetings have been held and letters exchanged between
interested parties namely the government ministries of Health, industry and Trade on the
one side, and lllovo on the other. As a result of these discussions it was agreed in July 2005
to conduct a technical feasibility study to assess the potential for fortifying sugar at the
Nchalo and Dwangwa sugar factories. Following this feasibility study a major consultative
meeting was held in December 2007 where representatives from the sugar fortifying
countries of Zambia and Nigeria were also invited to share their experiences and provide
guidance for Malawi. The objective of the meeting was to take on board all the different
perspectives and concerns regarding fortification, including those of lllovo, and to take
decisions about the next step for the fortification process in Malawi. The major outcome of
this meeting was that both the Government of Malawi (Department of Nutrition HIV and

AIDS) and lllovo agreed to conduct sugar fortification trials to determine the feasibility of
producing fortified sugar in Malawi.

A fortification trial programme was developed and funding secured from Irish Aid and
USAID to support the various components of the trials, including the engagement of a
consultant to facilitate the work. Vitamin A fortificant was provided by two major suppliers
(DSM of Switzerland and BASF of Germany) and used to fortify both raw and refined sugar
sold on the market. The fortified sugar was then subjected to laboratory tests locally and
overseas where the tests assessed the levels of vitamin A levels in the fortified sugar, the
extent to which the expected concentration was realized and the homogeneity of the
fortified sugar. Two local laboratories were used to test the samples, namely Department of
Chemistry at Chancellor College under the University of Malawi and the analytical
laboratory at the Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS). To provide verification for the local
results, duplicate samples of the fortified sugar and premixes were sent to BASF (Germany)
and DSM (South Africa) laboratories as well as the Zambia Food and Drugs Laboratory

(FDCL) in Lusaka. The local and international results were compared and found to be
consistent.

The trials were designed to assess consumer acceptance of the fortified sugar, determine
stability of the vitamin A in fortified sugar, determine distribution channels and provide
estimation of the cost implications to lllovo. The work to determine consumer awareness
was conducted between September and December 2008 whereas studies to determine the
stability of vitamin A in sugar were conducted from between June 2009 and June 2010.
Reports from the trials indicated that the consumers found the fortified sugar acceptable
when compared side by side with non—fortified sugars. Furthermore, consumers did not
detect any change in the taste and visual properties of the fortified sugar.

Stability studies indicated that there are manageable losses if the sugar is stored
appropriately over long periods away from direct sunlight and high humidity. This is
encouraging since sugar is reported to sell fast on the market with a turnover of 2 weeks in
many cases. The review of the distribution channels for sugar in Malawi demonstrated the
fact that sugar from lllovo reaches all corners of the country, though the volumes of
distribution vary depending on populations and economic status of the various regions
studied. It implies that the fortified sugar would be able to reach a significant part of the
Malawi population and help reduce the vitamin A deficiency in the country. A new Vitamin A
fortificant supplied by DSM, which does not require preparation of a pre—blend, was also
assessed and proved to be superior to the traditional forms of the fortificant in terms of
mixing properties. lllovo has settled for this form of vitamin A for its fortification program in
Malawi.

Apart from the local trials, fact finding visits were made to Zambia and Guatemala by staff
from lllovo Sugar Company, Malawi Bureau of Standards, Department of Nutrition HIV and
AIDS, Ministry of Industry and Trade, and UNICEF. The aim of the visits was to learn from
the two countries which are implementing the sugar fortification programmes with varied
success. A number of key lessons were learnt from the study tours which currently guide
the scale up of sugar fortification in Malawi. It was noted that there is need to intensify
sensitization of the public on the micronutrient status of the population and the importance
of sugar fortification. This would help create and sustain demand for fortified sugar because
the people appreciate the importance of fortifying sugar and the problem that it is
addressing. Secondly it was noted that adequate laws need to be in place to support food

fortification in general so that monitoring and inspection can be conducted based on
appropriate legal instruments.

It was further noted that for sugar fortification to succeed, there is need to ensure
stakeholder involvement so that all players can play their roles adequately in support of the
fortification program. It was emphasized during the visits that the development of
information, education and communication (IEC) materials on sugar fortification would have
to be done in a language that most of the population can understand. Preparation of these
IEC materials includes the development and use of a fortification logo for easy identification
of fortiﬁed products on the market including fortified sugar. The materials will be developed
with technical expertise from the Department of Nutrition HIV and AIDS with the purpose of
transferring information on the benefits of fortification for good nutrition. The publicizing of
the materials is aimed at increasing demand of the fortified foods when people attitudes
towards use of fortified foods are changed. Lastly, it was noted that key institutions that
support sugar fortification are the Malawi Bureau of Standards (M88) in terms of
development of appropriate legislation and enforcement as well as the Consumers
Association of Malawi (CAMA) which, apart from educating the consumers at various levels,

will play the policing role on the market in order to protect the consumers from inadequately
fortified sugar and unfavorable pricing practices.

Therefore, the conclusion drawn from these initial steps is that it is possible to fortify the
Malawian sugar with current forms of vitamin A used internationally and supplied by either
DSM or BASF and that the public health benefit in Malawi would be considerable. lllovo
Sugar Malawi Limited, currently the sole producer of sugar in Malawi, has already agreed to
support government in its efforts to control vitamin A deficiency through sugar fortification
starting in 2011. A Memorandum of Understanding between lllovo and the Government of
Malawi has been signed and included as Annex 2. This proposal seeks funding to support
the roll—out of sugar fortification at the two sugar plants belonging to lllovo Sugar Malawi

Limited and a detailed budget breakdown is provided in Annex 1 for supporting activities
expected to run from 2010 to 2015.

Preliminary results from the 2009 Micronutrient Survey show prevalence of vitamin A
deficiency among under-five children at 54% which is a decrease of 6% from 2001 to 2009.
The decrease may be attributed to a successful supplementation programme where the
coverage reached 69% of the target population in 20083. However, more needs to be done
to accelerate the reduction of any forms of VAD from the population.

A number of complementary options for addressing VAD exist which include Vitamin A
supplementation, fortification of staple foods such as sugar, oil, flour and dietary
diversification. Among these, fortification of staple foods with vitamin A is increasingly
becoming a leading method for addressing VAD within communities. The Malawi National
Fortification Alliance (NFA), which is a multi-sectoral organization mandated to promote food
fortification in Malawi, has proposed the fortification of oil, flour and sugar for the
management of vitamin A deﬁciencies.“ This is because the fortification of staple foods with
vitamin A is a sustainable strategy for managing VAD. Fortifying staple foods transfers most
of the cost of providing vitamin A from public resources to households. More importantly, the
cost of fortification is a fraction of the resources used for supplementation activities. A recent
report5 from the World Bank estimates that the cost of supplementation of children is $1.2
per child per year whereas the cost of providing micronutrients through fortification of staple
foods is $0.2 per person per year for the case of iron. The fortification of vitamin A would be
higher than iron by a factor of two as a maximum.

Criteria for choosing a food vehicle for fortification are provided in Table 1. In general, food
fortification aims at providing adequate nutrients to vulnerable people in the society through
popular food vehicles that are consumed consistently. Sugar is centrally processed at a
national level and as such, addition of vitamin A would be easy to manage and monitor.
There is no observable change to the colour or taste of the sugar. Among foods that are
commonly consumed in Malawi such as maize flour, wheat flour, edible oil and sugar, it is
only sugar that satisfies all three conditions outlined in Table 1. Table below compares the
fourfoods.

Fortification of several foods with micronutrients is more desirable than using one vehicle to
provide the needs of the population. This strategy takes into account the varying eating
habits within the population and avoids high costs of the fortified food resulting from high
levels of nutrients that are used in one single food item. Oil is cheap to fortify but
consumption is not adequate to address VAD and so complementing the provision of vitamin

A through fortified oil is desirable and this can be accomplished through the fortification of
other foods such as sugar. Sugar consumption per capita is higher than oil and so it Will act
as the main provider of increased vitamin A intake among the population based on the
existing consumption patterns and distribution. The micronutrient survey results of 2001 and
preliminary results for the 2009 survey show that sugar is popular across the country as
shown in Figure 1, and it is consumed in significant amounts to make impact.

The number of individuals reporting consumption of sugar on a given day is likely to be lower
than the general coverage in the population since sugar may not always be available on a
daily basis in all household. However, this fact supports the need for complementing
provision of vitamin A through the fortification of oil to provide adequate vitamin A on a more
continuous basis. Oil fortification is currently being practiced in Malawi on a voluntary basis
and UNICEF has a program to expand the program by supporting other existing producers
to fortify their oil. This expansion in oil fortification, coupled with increased advocacy for
fortified sugar, is expected to address the needs of the 40% that may not be addressed by
sugar fortification Based on data in Table 1. Furthermore, other interventions such as
supplementation with vitamin A and dietary diversification will likely to be required for some
portions of the society that may not be adequately covered by fortified sugar and oil.

Over the years there has been an increase in the proportion of people consuming centrally
processed foods with oil and sugar being high. Table 2 below, shows that 37% of women
reported consuming sugar the previous night in 2001 as opposed to 58% during the 2009
survey based on preliminary results from the 2009 Micronutrient Survey. There was an
increase of 15% for the children reporting consumption of sugar from 2001 to 2009 whereas
13% more men reported consuming sugar during the 2009 survey period.

Table 3 shows that people reporting consuming these common foods in 2009 is comparable
at 60% for sugar and oil but the amount of sugar consumed was about two times more than
oil. The average was 30 grams per day whereas for oil, the average was 14 grams per day.6
Table 3 shows that maize flour is the most consumed in the population, but the proportion
that is centrally processed is minimal. The amount of wheat consumed per capita is higher
than oil and sugar but the consumption at a national level is limited with only a third of the
population reporting consumption of wheat flour based products as shown in Figure 1.

The fortification of sugar is therefore a more attractive solution for increasing intake of
vitamin A among the population based on relatively high proportion of consumers within
the population and a high per capita consumption. This proposal therefore requests
support from Irish Aid and other development partners to extend support required to roll

out the fortification of sugar in Malawi at the two sugar factory belonging to lllovo Sugar
Malawi Limited.

The total amount of funding requested in this proposal to Irish AID is to partly fund the
total cost for the project of US$ 25.1 million required over 5 years. In the first year
(2010). the €1,000,000 (US$1.39 million)8 requested from Irish AID will go towards costs
of restructuring the sugar factories in readiness for fortification. The total requirements
for 2010 amounts to US$1.96 million and the difference will be met by contributions from
UNICEF (US$220,000) and USAID (US$350,000). Government contribution this year
will be in kind related to tax exemption benefits accorded to the equipment imported into

Malawi for installation at the sugar factories. These figures are presented in Section 17
under expenses for 2010.

Fortification is expected to commence in April 2011 and vitamin A fortificant will have to
be purchased at the beginning of 2011 to be available for use by April 2011. The budget
shows that in 2011, total expenses are estimated at US$44 million of which US$23
million will go towards the cost of procuring the vitamin A fortificant. The summary of
committed funds is provided in the budget in Section 17. Irish AID has committed
€1,000,000 (US$1.39 million) every year until December 2013, subject to periodic
review of progress and commitments being met by other partners. USAID has pledged
US$15 million every year until December 2012 with this contribution reducing to
US$100,000 for 2013. The USAID contribution may be subject to upward revision if
conditions in Malawi justify the need to support the program with larger amounts.
UNICEF contributions from 2011 cannot be quantified at this point. However, UNICEF is

central to the management of this project and any financial contributions during the
period would be dependent on resources provided by various development partners for
the management of vitamin A malnutrition in Malawi.

The external support to lllovo will continue from 2011 to 2013 with lllovo contributing
about US$ 700,000 to the program in terms of repair and maintenance costs and costs
related to introduction of new product on the market. The Government of Malawi in-kind
contribution increases gradually as more vitamin A is sourced during subsequent years
for fortification. The combined contributions from lllovo and the Government, in the first
three years, amount to about US$ 12 million every year.

After 2013, lllovo will bear the major costs related to fortification which is estimated to be
US$ 4.5 million per annum from 2014 while the Government and development partners
provide lower complementary support for monitoring and evaluation as well as social
marketing of the fortified sugar. The relative contributions during the five year period are
presented in Section 17 as the 2010—2015 Summary Budget.

Support from development partners in 2010 will go towards the cost of equipping and
restructuring of the two factories of Nchalo and Dwangwa to accommodate fortification
needs in preparation for the commencement of sugar fortification by April 2011. Further
financial resources will support the purchase of vitamin A for the fortification of sugar
from 2011 to 2013. Beyond 2013, lllovo will bear the costs of fortification when the
donors will have scaled down their financial commitment except for behavior change
activities and social marketing. This take over by lllovo is based on an agreement whose
details are described clearly in the Memorandum of Understanding with the Government
of Malawi and it is attached in Annex 2.

The sustainability of the program is based on lllovo recovering the cost of fortificant from
consumers which is estimated at 2% of the cost sugar. Based on current trends where
lllovo increases the price of sugar by 20% or more on an annual basis, the relatively low
percentage increase due to vitamin A fortificant should be manageable. More
importantly, discussions are underway to make sure that the fortification of sugar in
Malawi will be mandatory and lllovo will have to accommodate the fortification in their
production costs from 2014.

The activities outlined in this proposal will be implemented through collaboration with the
Government of Malawi. The sugar fortification program in Malawi is being managed by
the Department of Nutrition HIV and AIDS (DNHA) in the Office of the President and
Cabinet (OPC) and lllovo is a cooperating partner. The nature of this partnership is
clearly outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding between DNHA and lllovo. Apart
from Irish Aid, DNHA is working in close collaboration with development partners like
UNICEF and USAID. There is close collaboration in the provision of financial and

 

9 Production at the plant is in 3 shifts and so it is expected that supervisors from each shift will be trained
making 6 factory operators. Six laboratory personnel are expected to be trained from the two plants with follow
up on site training planned after the formal training at Chancellor College laboratory.

1” At least six inspectors from MBS will be trained

technical assistance for this project and the role of the Secretary for Nutrition, HIV and
AIDS is to provide leadership in terms of project direction, policy issues, sourcing of
funding and coordination of various players involved.

The Malawi National Fortification Alliance (NFA), under the Micronutrient Technical
Working Group, is closely linked to the program as part of its mandated to design,
advocate, implement, monitor and evaluate food fortification programmes in the country.
The NFA comprises a variety of experts including economists, nutritionists, industry
experts, chemists, quality control and assurance experts, statisticians, consumer
watchdogs and the business fraternity. It should be pointed out here that the Secretariat
continues to work closely with UNICEF and DNHA in discussing the implementation plan
with lllovo Management. Meetings and factory visits to lllovo will be conducted with
representation from MoIT as the secretariat. DNHA recently presented the latest
information on the sugar fortification proposal to the NFA meeting conducted in on
September 30th and 1 October, 2010. Four major working groups make up the NFA with
multiple organizations supporting work of various working groups. The four working

groups all report to the Secretariat, which is the Directorate of Industry as shown in the
Organogram in Figure 2.

The roles and responsibilities outlined here are based on the various roles that
organisations play in the National Fortification Alliance. The NFA Secretariat plays the
role of managing activities of the various stakeholders in relation to the national
fortification agenda. The NFA organises national NFA meetings, participates in working
group meeting and advocates for fortification and financial resources to support
promotion of food fortification in Malawi. This includes advocating to industry to adopt
fortification. Their inclusion in the alliance is based on their government or civic mandate
at a national level and relevance to the fortification work. The sugar fortification program
is one of those activities supported by the NFA and so various players will conduct their
duties as part of their responsibilities within the NFA stipulated in the organogram above.

GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI (DNHA and MINISTRY OF HEALTH)

DNHA will contribute to the program financially by removing import taxes related to
imported vitamin A and equipment to be used for sugar fortification. This contribution as
outlined in Section 17 (2010-2015 Summary Budget) amounts to 10% of the programme
costs. DNHA will provide support to the program through removal of surtax charges for
fortification sugar on the local market. DNHA will work closely with the Ministry of Health
(MoH) and the Consumers Association of Malawi to educate the public on the benefits of
consuming fortified sugar for better nutrition. The education program will help in creating
demand for sugar based on the Nutrition Communication and Education Strategy. CAMA
leads the activities as a consumer watchdog and an organization that has the credibility
of the people in the country. However technical support for appropriate messages will be
led by the DNHA in consultation with the Ministry of Health Nutrition Unit.

DNHA will continue to advocate for the use of fortified foods beyond the activities
outlined in the five year program as part of its mandate to promote adequate nutrition in
Malawi. Inspectors from the Ministry of Health will implement programs to monitor quality
of fortified sugar on the market. The two organisations and DNHA will also work hand in
hand to publicise the fortification logo and raise awareness of preferred handling habits
for fortified sugar at household level. DNHA will lead monitoring and impact evaluation
work among the population to determine consumption of fortified foods at community
level and impact of the program to the vitamin A status within the population. In addition,
the government will contribute in kind through personnel working in the food control
program for fortified foods. DNHA will also continue to lobby within government and with
other development partners to secure the additional funding required to implement all the
activities outlined in this proposal.

DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS (IRISH AID, USAID, UNICEF)

Development partners will support the government with financial resources and technical
assistance to roll out the sugar fortification programme for the first four years but then
this support will diminish as 60M and lllovo assume more responsibility.

In addition, UNICEF will manage financial resources for the program by channelling
funding to implementing agencies, to suppliers of equipment as well as facilitate the
timely purchase of vitamin A fortificant. UNICEF will identify and support provision of
technical assistance to lllovo through recruitment of appropriate consultants to train
personnel at lllovo and build national capacity in the area of enforcement of legislation
for fortified sugar and social marketing for the product. UNICEF will monitor the progress
of the sugar fortification work and report appropriately to the development partners
through donor reports and inform other stakeholders through the Micronutrient Technical
Working Committee.

 
 
 

  

 

ILLOVO: will provide personnel to implement the necessary restructuring within their
factories and install equipment for fortification. lllovo will also be responsible for
maintenance of equipment once it is installed and will continue to implement quality
assurance procedures to ensure that adequately fortified sugar is marketed at all times.
lllovo will finance work related to rebranding of the fortified sugar and management of
any changes on the market related to introduction of a new product. This includes the
changes to their packaging materials and any surveillance work on the market to be
responsive to changes so that demand for sugar is not compromised in anyway due to
the introduction of the fortified sugar. The company will undertake these activities and
will assume the full cost of purchasing vitamin A fortificant after 2013 in accordance with
the articles of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government of
Malawi and lllovo.

THE MALAWI BUREAU OF STANDARDS (MBS): will provide quality control and
inspection services specific to sugar fortification over and above their current quality
scheme arrangements with lllovo sugar.

 

Provision of adequately fortified sugar for local consumption to improve vitamin A status
for under— ﬁve children and the general population in Malawi

 

1. Dwangwa and Nchalo restructured and capable of fortifying both raw and refined
sugar by April 2011

2. lllovo personnel trained in fortifying sugar and analysis of vitamin A in sugar within
the lllovo factories by April 2011

3. Adequately fortified sugar available for consumption in Malawi at household level

4. Increased awareness on the benefits of fortified foods in combating malnutrition to
improve nutrition among the population

5. Provision of fortified sugar to consumers in Malawi. All sugar consumed in Malawi will
be fortified from April 2011 and so it is expected that 60% of the population will be
covered based on current information“. The coverage is expected to reach 90% in 5
years as a result of continued advocacy for consumption of fortified sugar Interim
results will be based on household surveys conducted in conjunction with other
assessments in identified sites such as urinary iodine sentinel site surveillance to be
conducted on a yearly basis

6. Increased vitamin A intake of at least 50% of the Estimated Average Requirement
(EAR) as a result of consuming sugar that is adequately fortified.

7. Contribution to the reduction of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) in Malawi by lowering
VAD prevalence among under-five children and the general population by 5% over 5
years. Studies12 have shown that the reduction is dependent on initial VAD levels and
absolute vitamin A intake based on daily per capita consumption and vitamin A
concentration in the sugar consumed. The reduction is found to be non—linear and the
extent of the VAD reduction will be closely monitored through specific evaluation
studies in identified areas.

- DHNA to enter into agreement with Illovo on responsibilities of the Government and
Illovo in preparation for implementation of the sugar fortification program. The
agreement to be formalized in a signed Memorandum of Understanding for activities
to be conducted from 2010 to 2015. Illovo commitment to fortification beyond 2015
will be as a result of legislation for fortification that is being formulated to make sure
that all sugar for local consumption in Malawi will be fortified.

o ILLOVO will supervise the restructuring of their sugar plants and installation of
appropriate equipment by March 2011 to ensure that fortification takes place in April
2011. The monitoring of the program will continue on a regular basis through review
of production figures and percentages of adequately fortified sugar on the market in
Malawi.

- Illovo management will provide the specifications for restructuring to be clone and the
equipment required. The plans and equipment will be independently verified by a
consultant to ensure that the equipment to be bought is compatible with the
suggested design. UNICEF will facilitate the purchase of appropriate equipment from
suppliers by reviewing equipment details and facilitating purchasing of equipment for
both factories. Equipment will be procured and delivered to Malawi through UNICEF.

o UNICEF working in conjunction with DNHA will assess the plans developed by Illovo
for the restructuring of the sugar factories and procurement of equipment described
in Tables 4 and 5. UNICEF will ensure that these plans are technically sound and
that sufficient financial safeguards are in place before transferring Irish Aid funding to
Illovo.

o UNICEF will purchase Vitamin A fortificant for the first 3 years which will be donated
to the Government through DNHA for use by Illovo. The vitamin A fortificant for the
2011 production is to be delivered to Illovo for fortification by March 2011. The
sourcing of vitamin A fortificant through UNICEF will continue as a donation to DNHA
for fortification of sugar up to 2013. Illovo will take over the procurement of required
fortificant as a donation to Government (DNHA) after 2013.

0 With support from partners, the programme will provide technical assistance to Illovo
and the Government in terms of capacity building. For Illovo, this will be in terms of
requirements for sugar fortification and quality assurance and quality control related
to fortified sugar production. Training will also be provided to the personnel in the
laboratories of the two factories to enable them test for vitamin A in fortified sugar. A
key piece of laboratory equipment (UV Spectrophotometer) for use in testing vitamin
A at the factory has been procured for this reason. The inspectors at MBS will be
trained in monitoring fortified sugar at Illovo factories and any fortified sugar that is
imported into Malawi. This training will include factory audits and laboratory testing
skills. Food inspectors at district level, from the Ministry of Health, will be trained on
appropriate monitoring of fortified foods at the market in terms of packaging. labeling
and presence of vitamin A. The training will also include household monitoring of
coverage and use of fortified foods in the country. UNICEF will support training of
Ministry of Health laboratory staff in the analysis of fortified sugar to complement
skills available at Chancellor College and M88 laboratories so that samples of
fortified sugar can be tested readily from inspection programs of the Ministry of
Health.

 

Sugar Fortification Proposal 2010—2015 Page 14

 

o UNICEF will work with the Malawi Bureau of Standards to ensure that the factories
are Visited on a quarterly basis to conduct auditing and inspection of the fortification
process to determine adherence to the local sugar fortification standard and the costs
for the inspection are within the budgets provided.

0 Provision of support for social marketing of the sugar through collaboration of DNHA
with the Consumers Association of Malawi. DNHA will ensure technical quality of the
education materials to be distributed while CAMA will manage the dissemination
process. The development of IEC materials will be supported through complimentary
funding from Irish Aid whereas the dissemination has been budgeted for in this sugar
fortification budget from 2011. The messages will link the consumption of fortified
foods with improved health benefits for the consumers. The materials will use locally
produced fortified foods such as sugar, oil and other flours to market the fortification
logo for easy identification of the foods and link the logo to nutrition. The social
marketing preparation will include the following:

media briefing sessions on fortification

sensitization of community leaders and politicians

TV and radio programs

Panel discussions and phone-in programs on the radio
dissemination of IEC materials like posters, fliers and brochures
launching of the fortification logo and

Marketing of the logo.

0 DNHA will lead monitoring and evaluation activities to determine the success of the
program on a yearly basis to ensure that the fortified sugar is consumed by the target
population for better impact. DNHA will use existing assessments in identified areas
to follow progress on the consumption patterns such as sentinel sites surveillance for
urinary iodine to be set up by the Ministry of Health to assess effectiveness of
consuming iodized salt. The amount of fortified sugar available will be determined
through reports provided by the industry on production volumes and the Malawi
Revenue Authority on vitamin A procured and Malawi Bureau of standards on the
amount vitamin A fortificant used in the factories.

The monitoring of the contribution to the reduction in VAD among the target population,
as a result of sugar fortification, will be conducted as impact evaluation surveys to take
place in representative areas of the population after three years. A more extensive
assessment is expected after five years such as the MlCS assessment scheduled for
2015. During the five years, it is expected that mini assessments will be conducted as
part of surveillance work in sentinel sites to monitor the consumption patterns. The
Malawi Bureau of Standards as part of its quality mark monitoring scheme, will provide
information on compliance at the factories and this will indicate the percentage of fortified
sugar samples produced with adequate levels stipulated in the Malawi standard for
fortified sugar.

The provision of sugar to the household will be assessed by determining the percentage
of sugar on the market that contains adequate levels of vitamin A expected at household
level. This will be done through surveys in which sugar samples will be collected and
tested in a laboratory. This work will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Health
Environmental Health Section where District Food Safety and Hygiene (FSH) Officers will

11.

be involved. Plans are already underway to train these officers in the monitoring of
fortified foods at the market. The inspectors will visit retail sites and collect samples for
testing to determine the percentage of sugar on the market that is adequately fortified.
Materials for training the inspectors are available and the training will be conducted
before the end of 2010 with technical support from UNICEF. The inspection by District
FSH officers is part of a national food control plan that is being put in place in
collaboration with Malawi Bureau of Standards, MOH, the Malawi Revenue Authority and
other stakeholders to monitor quality of fortified foods in Malawi. Quarterly reports to the
NFA are expected with an annual aggregation of all inspection reports to provide a
national situation report for use by program managers within DNHA and the Ministry of
Health.

The programme will also determine the percentage of people among the target
population that are consuming fortified sugar. This will be done through household
surveys where DNHA will play a leading role to determine coverage. These surveys will
determine percentage of households that consume sugar by identifying those that have
fortified sugar in their households. Awareness among the population of the benefits of
fortified sugar will be determined through household surveys among consumers.

Factory visits will be conducted to ensure resources are used for its intended purpose
and to support implementation. Monitoring of the activities within this proposal, such as
training of personnel and supply of vitamin A fortificant will be carried out by UNICEF in
collaboration with the relevant implementing partners following the Log Frame provided
in Section 11. Most of the proposed activities build on existing programmes and thus will
benefit from the same monitoring and evaluation systems. Key monitoring and evaluation
indicators are indicated in the log frame.

Information gathered will be submitted to the National Fortification Alliance (NFA) which
a national is working group mandated to design, advocate, implement, and monitor and
evaluate fortification programmers. The NFA is one of the committees under
Micronutrient Technical Working Group of the National Nutrition Committee which is a
sub-committee chaired by Ministry of Industry and Trade. The NFA meets on a quarterly
basis, and when the need arises.

The detailed five year budget is presented in Annex 1 and is preceded by a summary in
Section 17. The detailed budget is divided into 3 sections, Initial Costs for Restructuring,
Operating and Maintenance Costs and Vitamin A Fortificant costs. The final total
provided incorporates these three costs and project support and recovery costs for
UNICEF to manage the program on behalf of Government and development partners.
The initial costs for restructuring include costs for buying equipment and funds for
redesigning of the two factories. These funds are required as soon as possible in 2010 in
order to prepare the factories for fortification to take place in April 2011. The Operating
Costs include costs for quality control at the factory, inspection at commercial level and
monitoring of consumption at household level by DNHA. It also includes costs for factory
inspection by MBS costs for maintaining and repairing fortification equipment. Illovo will
fund maintenance costs and depreciation costs. The total costs include contribution from
government in kind.

A summary of the costs is provided in Section 17 indicating the breakdown of the costs
for the five year period. The total project expenditure indicates financial resources
required to pay for expenses during the five years. The need will increase from US$1.96

 

Sugar Fortiﬁcation Proposal 2010-2015 Page 16

million dollars to US$ 4.36 million by 2015. As presented in the budget, the major costs
from 2011 will be related to vitamin A fortification where the estimated cost in 2011 is
US$3 million. Taking into account an increase in production of 5% every year, the cost
for vitamin A fortificant is expected to reach US$37 million by 2015.

The funds so far committed for these costs in 2010 are provided as Committed Funds. It
should be noted in the table for committed funds that the 2010 figures include funds
provided by USAID amounting to US$350,000 and from UNICEF amounting to
US$220,000. Irish AID is committing 1 million Euros for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013
subject to satisfactory progress reports and other partners maintaining their
commitments. USAID has committed US$15 million for 2011 and 2012 with the
contribution in 2013 set at US$100,000 but subject to upward revision if the conditions at
the time warrant increased support to the program. Government contribution in terms of
tax exemptions is provided in the table. It is shown in the table that the contribution will
increase from US$17.325 in 2010 to US$618,000 in 2015. Apart from these figures,
government will contribute in the form of other services provided by the Ministry of
Health, Ministry of Industry and Trade as well as DNHA in support of the sugar
fortification program.

There is a financial gap of US$873,000 million in 2011 which is expected to rise to
US$27 million based on current commitments if the Government of Malawi or no other
development partners contribute financially to the program .The total cost of needs will
increase as more sugar is fortified. In 2014, when lllovo takes up all the costs related to
fortification, the gap is reduced to about US$297,000 which is mainly related to
inspection costs at commercial level and household level and project support costs for
UNICEF. DNHA will continue discussions with development partners and the
Government to provide for resources to cover this gap. The contribution by government
will continue to increase over the years in terms of financial incentives by exempting
import taxes for vitamin A fortificant sourced.

In summary, the total funding sought from Irish Aid is €4,000,000 over the next 4 years
as indicated in the summary budget attached. This funding will be used in particular to
cover the initial refurbishment of the two sugar factories through the purchase of
equipment between October 2010 and March 2011. After 2010, lrish Aids funds will be
used to contribute to the purchase of vitamin A fortificant for 3 years. An overview of the
use of Irish Aid funding is as follows:

Illovo will contribute significantly from 2011 through costs related to internal programs for
product development and marketing of the fortified sugar. These costs are expected to
increase from US$ 191,000 in 2011 to US$437,000 in 2015 as shown in Annex 1 under
Operating and Maintenance costs. The work involves activities related to changing of
packaging in terms of labelling information and design, as well as surveillance on the
market. Illovo will also promote the fortified sugar using its own resources as stipulated in
the Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Malawi.

The funds provided by Irish Aid, USAID and other donors will be managed by the
UNICEF accounting system. Management of the funds will follow UNICEF procedures
with the Nutrition Section taking charge of the expenses related to this budget and
accountability. And Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT) is a common
operational frame work United Nations system for transferring cash to government and
non-governmental Implementing Partners. HACT uses macro and micro assessments to
determine risk, as well as assurance activities such as audits and spot checks. It also
introduces a new harmonized format for implementing partners to request funds and
report on how they have been used. The macro assessment is a desk review of the
existing assessment of the national public financial management system that takes place
once per programming cycle. The micro assessment looks at the soundness of the
implementing partner’s financial management system. Spot-checks are the resultant
work after micro-assessments of Partners. The spot-checks as a follow-up to micro
assessments looks at the financial, accounting, administrative and programme
processes governing funds received by IPs in order to assess the soundness of the
implementing partner’s financial management system, Spot-checks will be conducted to
Illovo to ensure prudency in the financial utilization.

Procedures are already underway to conduct such an assessment for Illovo so that when
funds are available; these will be transferred to Illovo with appropriate documentation for
monitoring expenditure. It is expected that early in 2011, a review of the expenditure will
be conducted to determine the use of the funds scheduled for expenditure in 2010 as per
budget information in Table 4 and Table 5. Funds disbursed to partners is supposed to
be liquidated within 6 months and so UNICEF will obtain regular reports from Illovo for
expenditures within specific periods to satisfy this requirement and no addition funds
would be provided without liquidation. Apart from these measures UNICEF conducts
spot checks of organisation where funds have been sent to determine appropriateness of
use and this happens.

The success of this project will be dependent mainly on adequate financing for the
procurement of vitamin A fortificant during the first years of fortification and the adoption
of all vitamin A costs by lllovo at the end of donor supported period, which ends in
December 2013. The gaps for the financing needs will have to be covered and DHNA is
committed to work with other development partners to make sure this happens. in 2010,
provision of funds to lllovo would have to be done in a timely manner to ensure that
fortification starts in 2011. Delayed disbursement of funds would be a cause of concern
as it will not allow for adequate time for importation of equipment and refurbishment of
the plants. This aspect would risk delayed implementation of the program. To accelerate
the processes, the MOU has already been signed and the micro—assessment of lllovo by
the independent institution is being given the priority it deserves at UNICEF to enable
transfer of funds when available.

The support to lllovo over the next three years provides lllovo with adequate time to
prepare financially for taking up the cost of vitamin A fortificant after 2013. The cost of
Vitamin A fortificant typically contributes more than 80% of fortification related costs. This
has been described by lllovo as a high one—time cost and that is why the initial costs for
vitamin A is being borne by development partners and government to ensure that the
program does not fail due to lack of vitamin A for fortification. Relative to the final cost of
sugar from the factory, the cost of fortification is typically close to 2% of the cost of
unfortified sugar. The consumer acceptance of the product will also be important in
creating demand and ensuring the success of this program. This area is being
addressed through the programs being planned for social marketing to ensure that the
population demands fortified foods and there a change in mentality to opt for fortified
foods on the market by 2013. The implementation of mandatory fortification of sugar is in
Malawi expected to in place when fortification commences in 2013.

 

., " ii ii iii i l i llxy

The request for funding will ensure that lllovo undertakes fortification of sugar
consistently for the first five years by allowing lllovo to take up the cost of fortification
after 3 years. This arrangement is based on the agreement between lllovo and
Government of Malawi in past discussions where lllovo requested Government to take
up the initial costs of starting fortification as lllovo prepares to take over all the costs. The
first two years are capital intensive because of the restructuring and purchase of vitamin
A. In the following years, the increase in costs will be dependent on the amount of sugar
that will be fortified during each of those years. Although the initial costs are high, the
investment is cost effective in that it will ensure that lllovo would be in a position to take
up the costs of fortifying sugar without outside support after December 2013. The cost to
lllovo is related mostly to the purchase of vitamin A fortificant and quality control at the
factory. The continuity of the program is legally assured based on the commitment from
lllovo stipulated in the Memorandum of Understanding. Furthermore, adherence to sugar
fortification by lllovo will be a result of the fact that the standard for sugar in Malawi is
being replaced one where fortification is mandatory as any food standard in Malawi.
Furthermore, the Department of Nutrition HIV and AIDS is working on documentation to
ensure that vitamin and mineral premixes imported for fortification programs in Malawi
should be exempted from Government taxes.

UNICEF will manage the collection of various reports related to sugar fortification from
stakeholders under the National Fortification Alliance. The NFA meets quarterly where
reports from various bodies implementing fortification initiatives submit latest data for
review. UNICEF is a member of the NFA and it will seek and provide relevant data to
Irish AID on the progress ofthe program. DNHA, MBS, MOH inspectors will be involved
in the monitoring of the program and a summary of their reports will be submitted to Irish
AID from time to time. In the event that the NFA has not met, UNICEF will be responsible
for providing relevant reports sought from stakeholders for activities outlined in the
budget. A report for the preparations conducted in 2010 would be provided in January
2011 as a single report to development partners. The midyear report for 2011 is
expected to report on the full scale implementation of the sugar fortification program.
The annual reports will be provided by the end January each year whilst the midyear
reports will be due on 31 July every year for the duration of the program.

The annual report will be compiled to provide the financial status of the program and
reports on various components of the program based on the periodic reports. The report
will describe the success in terms of the indicators such as the level of vitamin A in
fortified sugar produced at the factory and on the market. The report will also present any
significant findings related to consumer awareness, coverage of fortified sugar on the
market and activities to promote consumption of fortified foods in general including
sugar. Any training activities and inspection visits will be defined in the report and all
challenges highlighted. The report will outline the financial situation of the program. At a
national level, DNHA will report to the Micronutrient Technical Working Group on a
quarterly basis on the progress. These reports will be based on individual reports from
implementing agencies and field visits by partners. It is expected that any impact studies
conducted in representative areas within the period will contribute to the annual reports.
