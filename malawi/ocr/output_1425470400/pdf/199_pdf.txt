Strategic Objective Grant Agreement
August 20, 2001
Between

The United States of America, acting through the United States Agency for
International Development (hereinafter referred to as “USAID”)

and
The Government of the Republic of Malawi (hereinafter referred to as “the Grantee”)

WHEREAS, the Grantee and USAID (“the Parties”) hereby express their continued
commitment to the goals of Reduced Fertility and Risk of HIV/AIDS and Improved Child
Health and the Key Intermediate Results of Increased Distribution of Health Supplies through
Social Marketing, Improved Knowledge of Health Practices and Own HIV Status, Increased
Community Participation in Health and Orphan Care, Quality Health Services Expanded,
Flaming and Management Capacity Strengthened, Human Resources Recruitment and
Management Strengthened, and Health Reform Implemented;

WHEREAS, in order to focus and strengthen the efforts of the Parties in raising the health
status of all Malawians;

WHEREAS, the Grantee and USAID reafﬁrm their intentions regarding ﬁnancial and other
commitments contained in Project Grant Agreements which support and/or are
complementary to the Strategic Objective purposes such as the Project Grant Agreement for
Support to AIDS and Family Health (STAFH) and the Community Health Partnerships
(CHAPS) Project;

THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
Article 1: Purpose

The purpose of this Strategic Objective Grant Agreement (hereinafter referred to as
“the Grant Agreement" or “Agreement") is to set out the commitments and understanding of
the parties named above (the "Parties") about the Strategic Objective described below.
Article 2: Strategic Objective and Results

Section 2.1 Strategic Objective

The Strategic Objective is “Behaviors adopted that reduce fertility and risk of
HIV/AIDS and improve child health” (the “Objective”). The development hypothesis that
underlies the Objective is as follows:

As described in the Malawi National Health Plan for 1999-2004, the analysis of

constraints suggests that many of the problems are highly correlated. Service delivery is
constrained by an inadequate system for supplying drugs and other needed materials. Quality

 

Stir/legit? Obferfiw (II/“(ml Agnﬂrmmil ill-i'rugjrtn It

 

services are constrained by personnel shortages — a massive problem ---- -- and poor knowledge
and skills of health care providers in disease prevention. Improvements in the quality of
service depend upon the ﬂow of new, well trained personnel into the health, care system,
adequate supervison of service providers, and the provision of drugs and other supplies to all
levels throughout the system. These constraints are also impacted when equipment and
vehicles sit idle, sidelined because they are in need of repair. Lying behind many, but not
all, of these problems are: a) a basic scarcity of resources; b) a less than optimal system for
analyzing and allocating the resources; and c) ﬁnancial constraints.

Intrinsic to health care reform is the rationalization of policies and practices and the
efﬁcient use of resources. Many basic policies need to be addressed, not simply those related
to HIV/AIDS and health care ﬁnancing. Integrated planning for prevention. and care services
across provider lines (MOHP, CHAM and private facilities) is urgently needed. Intake into
schools that train health care personnel must be increased. The national policy of
decentralization will be implemented during the period covered by this agreement, and
signiﬁcant preparation will be required for the transfer of health facilities and responsibilities
to district level government. Efforts to provide quality health care services to the general
population (and target groups) should be addressed in a systematic and organized fashion.

The cause and effect model implicit in the National "Health Plan posits that adoption
of behaviors necessary for improving the health status of Malawians depends upon the
availability of health services and the ability of Malawians to access them. There are also
behavioral changes that can improve health which require no delivery of services, e.g.,
abstaining from sex, practicing safer sex, improving basic sanitation practices, and providing
adequate nourishment to pregnant mothers and babies.

The Strategic Objective and the Intermediate Results are designed to address the
national health problems on a number of fronts simultaneously, in. order to improve the
health delivery system and the overall health of Malawi’s citizens.

Section 2.2 Results

In order to achieve that Objective, the Parties agree to work, together to achieve the
following Results:

(a) Increased Distribution of Health Supplies through Social Marketing;
(b) Improved Knowledge of Health Practices and Own HIV Status;

(0) Increased Community Participation in Health and Orphan Care;

(d) Range and Quality Health Services Expanded;

(e) Flaming and Management Capacity of GOM and NGOs Strengthened;
(f) Human Resources Recruitment and Management Strengthened; and

(g) Health Reform Implemented.

These Results, and indicators by which achievement of the Results will be measured,
are further described in Annex 1, Ampliﬁed Description, to this Agreement. Within the
limits of the deﬁnition of the Objective in Section 2.1, this Section 2.2 may be changed by

written agreement of the authorized representative of the Parties without formal amendment
of the Agreement.

Annex I: Ampliﬁed Description

I. Introduction

This Annex describes the activities to be undertaken and the results to be achieved with
the funds obligated under this Agreement. Nothing in this Annex I shall be construed
as amending any of the deﬁnitions or terms of the Agreement.

11. Background
A. The Shared COM and USAID Strategic Plan

In May 1999, the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) published Malawils National Health
Plan (NHP) for 1999 to 2004. The NHP identifies four key health problems for attention:

High child mortality and morbidity

High maternal mortality and morbidity

High HIV seroprevalence and deaths due to HIV/AIDS related illnesses

High morbidity and mortality in the general population due to infectious diseases

PP’NI‘

The MOHP followed a participatory and analytic process in developing this comprehensive
plan. The USAID results framework for the health, population and nutrition (HPN) strategic
objective (SO) was built on its foundation, taking into consideration the areas of USAID
priorities and expertise and the results that could be achieved given the amount of funds that
might be available. The most crucial problems to be addressed are: l) lowering the risk of
HIV/AIDS, because of the epidemic’s tremendous impact on human resources and
productivity; 2) reducing fertility and population growth, which are essential for attaining
broad based economic growth; and, 3) lowering infant and child mortality rates, which if left
unchecked will continue to foster high fertility as parents try to compensate for under—ﬁve
mortality. These inter-related elements comprise USAID Objective No. 8: “Behaviors
Adopted That Reduce Fertility and Risk of HIV/AIDS and Improve Child Health.”

B. The Problem Analysis

The MOHP is the dominant provider of health care in Malawi, accounting for 600 o of
services delivered. Facilities managed by member institutions of the Christian Health
Association of Malawi (CHAM) account for 30% of service delivery, but they are not private
sector institutions in the conventional sense. The MOHP has a policy oversight role with
respect to CHAM Institutions. More important, perhaps, the GOM is their major source of
funds. The Ministry of Finance transfers to CHAM the resources that cover the base salaries
of all local CHAM personnel. In addition to MOHP and CHAM facilities there are only a
limited number of private medical practices in the country. Outside the framework of
modern preventive and curative medicine, traditional healers ~ including herbalists - still,
have a large following throughout the country.

slum-1t I  Amplified Descripn‘rm

 

There is no question about the fundamental condition of the nation’s health: for most
Malawians, death is often very close at hand. A large portion of the deaths of children, under—
ﬁve result from largely preventable or treatable diseases. Disease prevention and the use of
simple treatments are inhibited not only by lack of knowledge and the unavailability of
relevant supplies but also by an inadequate basic infrastructure. Estimates indicate that 97%

of all Malawians do not have adequate sanitation facilities and 53% lack access to a safe
source of water.

Malaria prevalence among under-ﬁve children was estimated at 40% in 1992 and 45% in.
1996, suggesting that the situation may be growing worse. Half of all Malawian children are
stunted (chronically undernourished) and a third are underweight. The problem, starts at
birth, with 20% of infants registering a low birth weight. Exclusive breastfeeding to six

months of age, a key means of ensuring adequate nutrition as well as disease protection for
infants, is rarely practiced.

The impact of HIV/AIDS on people’s lives is catastrophic. Presently over 700 0 of hospital
beds on medical wards are occupied by patients with HIV/AIDS-related conditions. The
health care system does not have the capacity or supplies to care for such a high number of
patients with serious medical problems, and referral of many of these patients to Home—based
Care (HBC) simply means that they die at home with little or no medical care. In addition to
directly affecting the health care system, the AIDS epidemic has already had a profound
impact on the health care human resources of Malawi. At present, 40% of posts in the
Ministry of Health are vacant and severe shortages of health personnel can be observed at
every health care facility in the country.

It is estimated that over 300,000 children have lost parents to AIDS, and this is projected to
increase to over half a million children by the year 2005. These children’s lives are severely
traumatized by experiencing the death of their mothers, and in many cases the deaths of their
fathers, and their subsequent deprivation as orphans. USAID’s 1998 Cliilctlren on the Brink

study estimated that in Malawi 36% of children under the age of 15 have lost one or both
parents.

AIDS is now the leading cause of death in adults. More than, 80,000 die annually ~ double
what the number would be without AIDS. This ﬁgure is projected to rise to over 100,000
adult deaths annually by 2005. The National AIDS Control Program with assistance from the
POLICY Project indicates that annually there are already about 70,000 new cases of AIDS.
The high rates of HIV/AIDS infection and the magnitude of adult deaths have a profoundly
negative impact on all sectors of Malawian society. Life expectancy has dropped over the
last decade and fewer adults are working to support the young and the elderly.

Dealing with this overwhelming problem requires emphasis on both prevention of new HIV
infections and mitigation of the impact of the epidemic. Most studies indicate that there are
high rates of knowledge about AIDS in Malawi, with over 97% of adults of both sexes being
aware of AIDS. Knowledge of how to prevent transmission is not as high, however. In
1996, women cited sex with multiple partners as a means of transmission more frequently
than did men (72% versus 49%), but far fewer women than men identified use of condoms as

 

Sim reg/r ' ( 9} 1f UM \ v: (f); wzr dig/1261714272( .1 34152.31? .3'

Anna l —-9 Amplifier! [)c’sr'l‘iplir'ui

 

a way to avoid getting AIDS (23% versus 47%). There are also anecdotal reports of
misconceptions and incorrect beliefs that air, water and witchcraft spread HIV.

Since knowledge of AIDS is high in Malawi, the next step is to deliver speciﬁc services and
commodities to prevent new infections and to bring about behavior change. These services
include voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), which has been well documented to help
people adopt risk reduction behaviors. Testing of pregnant women with the aim of reducing
the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) will also be introduced in combination with
improved labor and delivery services, infant feeding counseling and, when approved and
available, anti-retro viral (ARV) drugs. Although VCT is available in a few locations in
Malawi, to date these services have not been well funded, and supplies of HIV test kits have
been erratic. USAID-funded VCT centers in Blantyre and Lilongwe are attracting an
increasing number of clients; but for this intervention to be more effective, signiﬁcantly more
clients need to be served. Newer testing technologies are resulting in HIV testing that is done
outside of laboratory settings, and thus can be extended to rural areas. Increasing the
availability of and access to VCT and MTCT services are high priorities, and are
interventions in which USAID in partnership with US. Center for Diseases Control and
Prevention (CDC) has a comparative advantage in supporting.

The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) rose from 7.4% in 1992 to 14.4% in 1996 to 26% in
2000, while the fertility rate declined from 6.7 in 1992 to 6.3 in 2000. Candid and effective
sex education for young people is also needed, and although primary and secondary school
curricula have been developed, by and large they are not being taught. Most school teachers,
like many others in the society, are uncomfortable discussing HIV/AIDS or acknowledging
AIDS as the cause of family or neighborhood death.

The direct involvement of Malawi’s President in efforts to halt the spread of AIDS is a
welcome step. The National AIDS Control Program completed its Strategic Framework for
the years 2000 - 2004, and has begun the process of mobilizing resources to implement the
Framework. All of the USAID interventions for HIV/AIDS are included within the
framework and directly support the GOM program to respond to the AIDS epidemic.

III. Financial Plan

The ﬁnancial plan for the Program is set forth in the attached table which presents the HPN
SOS Behaviors Adopted That Reduce Fertility and Risk of HIV/AIDS and Improve Child
Health Program Financial Plan by program activity and source. Amounts shown are in US.
Dollars. Obligations for the Program will occur in FY 2001 —FY 2005 with implementation to
occur through September 30, 2006.

Changes may be made to the ﬁnancial plan by representatives of the Parties without formal
amendment to the Agreement, if such changes do not cause (1) USAID's contribution to
exceed the amount speciﬁed in Section 3.1 of the Agreement, or (2) the Grantee's
contribution to be less than the amount speciﬁed in Section 3.2 of the Agreement.

IV. Results To Be Achieved/Results Framework

USAID’s Objective is “Behaviors Adopted That Reduce Fertility and Risk of HIV/AIDS and
Improve Child Health.” This Objective will be met through four key intermediate objectives
and three supporting intermediate objectives:

Increased distribution of health supplies through social marketing;
Improved knowledge of health practices and own HIV status;
Increased community participation in health and orphan care;
Range and quality health services expanded;

Flaming and management capacity strengthened;

Human resources recruitment and management strengthened; and
Health reform implemented.

This Objective includes the same three components as the previous HPN Strategic Objective
for 1995-2000, but places greater emphasis on HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation. It also
incorporates the new health reform activities that are underway in the MOI-1P by emphasizing
the delivery of the Essential Health Care Package, Decentralization, Hospital Autonomy and
Quality Assurance. It directly supports activities under the National Reproductive Health
Strategy, the National HIV/AIDS Framework and Agenda for Action, the National Health
Plan and District AIDS and Health Plans in target districts.

V. Indicators of Achievement

Achievement of this Strategic Objective will be measured by the following indicators:

(1) increase in modern contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) to 32% among married women;
(2) increase in couple-years of protection (CYP) to 700,000; and,

(3) increase in the total number of clients served annually at HIV voluntary counseling and
testing (VCT) centers to 55,000 by September 2006.

The Summary Performance Data Table that follows summarizes the performance monitoring
indicators, baseline, intermediate and ﬁnal results to be achieved under the S08 Program for
the Strategic Objective, the Key Intermediate Results and supporting Intermediate Results.
These indicators will serve to inform the Government of Malawi and USAID with regard to
program performance and will be employed to assist the parties in determining the allocation
of resources in future years.

VI. Indicative Activities
On-going Activities

The Strategic Objective 8 builds on the continuing success of initiatives under two on-going
bilateral agreements under SO 3: Support to AIDS and Family Health, (STAFH) and
Community Health Partnerships (CHAPS). The STAFH project supports social marketing of
condoms, behavior change communication for HIV and reproductive health, community—
based distribution agents and health services related to reproductive health and. HIV/AIDS. It
also supports training activities and provides technical assistance to strengthen management
of the Reproductive Health Unit, the National AIDS Secretariat, and local. NGOs. The
CHAPS project focuses on social marketing of ORS and bed nets, on improving knowledge
of good health practices and increasing community-level involvement to improve the health
of mothers and children. CHAPS also supports the expansion of quality health services for
mothers and children and improved management capacity of District Health Management
Teams (DHMT) in targeted districts. Both projects are implemented through government
agencies and NGOs and focus on strengthening the partnership between these two sectors.
Activities under STAF H and CHAPS will be completed by September 2002. As funds for
STAF H and CHAPS activities are expended the activities under 808 described below will

come on line to provide continuity and avoid breaks in technical assistance and provision of
goods and services.

New Activities: Key Intermediate Results (KIR)

The overall Objective 8 and the key and supporting intermediate results will be achieved
through a series of activities that are being collaboratively developed by GOM, USAID and
implementing partners. These activities are being ﬁnanced by USAID through the transfer of
ﬁeld support funds to projects and cooperating agencies that are working directly with
partners in Malawi, and through the obligation and commitment of funds through the
Agreement for SO 8. The list of planned activities presented for each intermediate result
includes those bridging activities that are ﬁnanced under the on—going STAF H and/or
CHAPS projects and are also programmed to receive ﬁeld support funds for FY2001. For
those activities that will be funded directly from this Agreement, USAID will provide
technical assistance, training and other required support to design and implement these
activities in a cost—effective and sustainable fashion.

A. KIR 8.1 Increased Distribution of Health Supplies through Social Marketing

Since 1994, Population Services International (PSI) has been socially marketing Chishango
brand condoms throughout the country. Annual sales of between 6 and 7 million condoms
are complemented by marketing campaigns and HIV prevention behavior change messages
that are disseminated through radio, print material, and mobile video units that travel around
the countryside Visiting rural communities. In addition to C hishango, PSI markets Thanzi
oral rehydration salts (ORS) nationwide and Chitetezo Insecticide-treated Nets (ITN) and the
retreatment kit, M ’bwezero Chitetezo, in the district of Blantyre and through major
distributors to other selected urban areas. In collaboration with, Project HOPE and Save the
Children/U S, PS1 has also piloted a small activity to socially market exclusive breast feeding
(EBF) in three districts. At present the activities for condoms and HIV prevention are funded
under the STAF H project, while ORS and EBF are supported under the CHAPS project. The
marketing of ITN products in Blantyre has been funded through a grant from
USAID/Washington and expanded to limited urban areas with PSI’s own resources. Funds
from the CHAPS project will ﬁnance one additional year of the present ITN program.

In order to have a results activity for social marketing activities that is more streamlined and
cost—efﬁcient and easier to manage, a new results package (RP) that combines all of these
elements is being developed. The RP will include all of the on—going activities and will make
provision to scale-up marketing of ITN products in collaboration with the MOHP to achieve
Malawi’s targets for the Rollback Malaria Initiative (RBI). During development of the RP
the appropriateness for other socially marketed products will be explored. A draft RP for
Social Marketing will be reviewed with the MOHP and partner donors (Germany for
condoms, Japanese International Cooperation Agency (J ICA) and UNICEF for ITN products)
and approved.

This KIR for social marketing will be monitored through sales of the speciﬁc health products
to Wholesalers and distributors. In addition, information will be collected on the outlets
where products are sold including type of outlet and national coverage. Because the MOHP
runs parallel programs that provide free distribution of condoms and ORS and will sell ITN
products at special low prices, the distribution of the MOHP products will also be monitored
in order have a complete picture of national coverage and identify any stockouts or supply
problems.

B. KIR 8.2 Improved Knowledge of Health Practices and Own HIV Status

Knowledge of health, nutrition, family planning and HIV/AIDS is measured at regular
intervals through the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). These national level surveys
have been conducted in 1992, 1996 and 2000. The preliminary results from the 2000 MDHS
indicate that there is a high level of knowledge about family planning and HIV/AIDS and
lower levels of knowledge about appropriate child health practices. The traditional program
for increasing knowledge of better health practices has been through Information, Education
and Communications (IEC) programs. IEC programs were subsequently modiﬁed to focus
on Behavior Change Communications (BCC) with messages developed to lead more

 

Strategic ()birs'cfliw (ii/rm! rig/“(’t’tllt’lll 1’33"u".![tgtx' / .L"
Behaviors Advpmd that Reduce Far/lily amt Risk off/1 l'JH {[235

and Improve (' ‘lzi/r/ [Iva/(h
Allilti‘t I  Hip/{fiat ['h'scriprion

 

 

speciﬁcally to better behaviors. While this approach held merit, researchers also concluded
that there were other elements in the environment that were needed to reinforce and facilitate
the adoptions of new, and healthier, behaviors. This led to the development of Behavior
Change Interventions (BCI) that take into account the individual and household and the
community and environment in which they live. The activities to be supported under the KIR
should lead to the adoption of good behaviors that are indicated in SOB. They could also lead
to better use of quality health services (KIR 8.4), greater participation in community health
and orphan activities (KIR 8.3) and increased use of socially marketed products (KIR 8.1).
KIR 8.2, therefore, will feed into the Objective and the other Key IRs. During the design of
this KIR it was determined that the most critical knowledge that should be promoted was the
knowledge of one’s own HIV sero-status, be it positive or negative. This is because
individuals will adopt different behaviors to reduce transmission of HIV depending on
whether they are sero-positive or sero—negative. This KIR, therefore, will be monitored
through number and percentage of persons visiting HIV VCT centers and receiving their
results. These ﬁgures will be disaggregated by gender.

IEC and BCC messages are developed and transmitted through print media, radio, television,
video ﬁlms, drama, song, and lecture (in classrooms and informal settings). Indicative
programs through which BCC/BCI messages will be delivered. are listed below.

Workplace BCI Activities on HIV and RH with civil servants and private sector;
Activities in HIV/RH targeting youth;

Activities in HIV/RH targeting faith-based organizations;

Activities in HIV/RH targeting high—risk groups; and

Activities in maternal and child health, HIV and RH targeting communities through
village health committees and volunteers.

C. KIR 8.3 Increased Community Participation in Health and Orphan Care

Community members actively participate in identifying local health problems and developing
activities to address them. They participate in Village Health Committees (VHC) that
organize water system construction and maintenance and build latrines and hand—washin g
facilities. Community and Village AIDS Committees (CAC and VAC) organize task forces
for orphans, youth and home—based care. Villagers volunteer to serve as Community—based
Distribution Agents (CBDA) for family planning supplies and information on RH and
HIV/AIDS. Others volunteer to organize and run local Drug Revolving Funds (DRF) that
keep a supply of essential medicines like ORS and SP available at replacement cost for
treatment of infants and children with life-threatening illnesses. Ongoing activities are being
supported through District Partnership Grants to DHMTs and PVOs under the CHAPS
project and to local NGOs receiving sub—grants from Umoyo Network. Under KIR 8.3 there
will be a greater emphasis on HIV-related activities especially those that target orphans and
vulnerable children (OVC), and youth. There will also be an expansion of HBC activities
that focus on care and feeding of adults who are ill and provision of psycho-social. support for
family members who care for them. Progress will be monitored by keeping count of the
active community committees that are established and working to support orphans and other

AIDS related activities, and by tracking the number of active volunteers who have been
trained and are providing services as CBDAs and DRF volunteers.

Indicative Activities under KIR 8.3 include:

0 CBDAS: Both District Health Ofﬁces and NGOs train and supervise activities of
CBDAs who work at the community level providing family planning services and
information on family planning, STIs and HIV/AIDS prevention. Under this KIR
CBDAs will be encouraged also to provide more RH services to the youth, provide
more information on the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) of family planning,
and refer clients for new RH services including vasectomy and emergency
contraception. Focusing on the youth will support the National Reproductive Health
Strategy objective to provide adolescent reproductive health services. Information on
LAM should be given because it is not only a good method of contraception, but
research shows that exclusive breastfeeding for the ﬁrst six months can help prevent
mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS when compared to providing mixed
feedings to infants, a common practice in Malawi. CBIDAs should provide
information and education to community members on vasectomy because services are

becoming more accessible as more providers are trained in. non—scalpel vasectomy
(NSV) technique.

- DRFs: The establishment of DRFs at community and village level is being supported
by USAID through the CHAPS project as well as by other donors. Experience has
shown that DRFs are most effective in rural areas that are located farthest away from
formal health facilities, and must be well-supervised and supported by DHMTS to
keep them functioning. Since DHMTs organize and manage DRFs in different ways,
an assessment to determine which practices are most effective will be carried out as

part of the CHAPS project evaluation. Recommendations will be used in the design
of future activities.

0 CAC/VAC: District AIDS Coordinating Committees (DACC) in. several districts have
been actively involved in establishing AIDS Committees in communities and
corresponding villages with support from the Community—based Options for
Protection and Empowerment (COPE) project over the past five years. Lessons
learned from COPE will be scaled up through support to DACCs through District
Partnership Grants and to local NGOs through Umoyo Network sub-grants.

KIR 8.4 Range and Quality Health Services Expanded

Through support from the STAF H and CHAPS projects, reproductive health (RH) and
maternal and child health (MCH) services offered by the MOHP, CHAM and NGO service
providers have been expanded and improved. Policy guidelines, standards and training
curricula have been developed, health workers have been trained, supervision and logistics
activities have been developed and are being carried out. While reproductive health services
have been supported at the national level, MCH services have expanded and improved in

component that focuses on improving client satisfaction and providing the best service
possible with the resources available. Health workers and DHMTS are taught a team—based
process of problem identiﬁcation and analysis. They then explore solutions and identify the
best ones to implement and then measure the results. This process is being rolled-out to the
health facility level in eight districts, while Quality Assurance advisors are also working at
the national level to support a newly—establish MOHP QA Task Force.

KIR 8.4 will focus on the services included in the Essential Health Package (EHP), which is
one of the areas of Health Reform that is being fully developed under the joint MOHP-Donor
Implementation Plans (JIP). Since several of the services that are to be included in the EHP
are new and evolving USAID will provide technical expertise, training, supervision and
commodities to introduce and/or scale-up these new interventions. Several USAID/W
cooperating agencies that are already providing support will receive field support funds to
continue this work. Because the CDC receives separate and additional funding under the
USG LIFE Initiative, CDC technical assistance will be requested to collaborate and support
the introduction and scaling—up of speciﬁc HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities. By
providing technical support to the national level program units and using lessons learned and
best practices coming out of ﬁeld-based implementation in the districts with District
Partnership Grantees, USAID will support the national expansion of these services, all of
which are included in the National Health Plan and the National HIV/AIDS Framework. An
illustrative list of these services is described below.

Post Abortion Care (PAC): Complications from spontaneous and induced abortions are a
major cause of maternal death in Malawi where there is a high demand for comprehensive
PAC services. By training health care providers to offer PAC, the maternal mortality and
morbidity rates that result from unsafe abortion and preventable repeat abortions should be
reduced. Under this activity, USAID will provide support to the RHU to develop the national
strategy, guidelines, and training materials for PAC. With support from JHPIEGO and
EngenderHealth, services will be launched initially at three central hospitals and will be
incorporated into all the MOHP and CHAM district hospitals and selected health centers by
2006.

Long-term and Permanent Contraceptive (LTPC) Methods: LTPC methods which include
mini-laporatomy under local anesthesia (ML/LA), insertion of Norplant implants, and n0—
scalpel vasectomy (NSV) are currently offered at 29 out of 33 MOHP District and CHAM
hospitals. (A1129 are providing ML/LA and Norplant, while only six are also providing
NSV.) Support to scale—up LTPC services is being provided by EngenderHealth (formerly
AVSC). Through ﬁeld support funding to the USAID/W EngenderHealth project, this
organization is able to award sub—grants to the MOHP and CHAM and provide technical
assistance to support a system for training, supervision and monitoring of all LTPC services.
FY2001 ﬁeld support funds are programmed to provide equipment, supplies, and training in
surgical techniques and counseling, as well as limited renovations of operating theaters and
waltlng areas.

Infection Prevention (1P): Improving infection prevention procedures at all health facilities in
Malawi is an important priority for all USAID—supported health activities. Infection
prevention procedures include proper decontaminating, cleaning and sterilization. of
instruments and supplies, as well as proper disposal of hazardous wastes, hand washing with
soap and use of protective gloves. IP activities will be included in District Partnership Grant
and Umoyo Network sub-grant activities. IP practices will also be included in curriculum
development and training activities related to RH, HIV/AIDS and MCH services.

Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT): With the introduction of rapid HIV test kits and
same—day results, the Malawi AIDS Resource and Counseling Organization (MACRO) saw a
four-fold increase in the number of clients between 1999 and 2000. In, addition, the number
of clients who actually learned their sero-status increased from 70% in. 1999 to over 9.9% in
2000. Support for MACRO to expand from the two current centers in Lilongwe and Blantrye
to a third center in Mzuzu has already been included in funding from the Umoyo Network
sub—grant. Further expansion of MACRO through outreach activities and linkages with other
NGOS and GOM service providers is anticipated. In order to scale-up VCT activities in a
standardized manner, plans are being developed to prepare training curricula for counseling
and laboratory VCT activities and to establish uniform monitoring and logistics systems that
will be used nationally by the National AIDS Secretariat (NAS) and. the  to program,
track and evaluate services and to guarantee the adequate supply of rapid. HIV test kits. With
technical assistance from CDC, USAID will support the NAS to develop VCT policies,
guidelines and standards at the national level. Facilitated by Umoyo Network and in
partnership with NAS, the RHU, CDC, other donors, and implementing partners standardized
training curricula with be developed and piloted. With assistance from CDC, USAID will
support establishing a national monitoring system so that all organizations that offer VCT
services will report the designed information to the NAS following a standardized format. In,
a like manner, advisors from the JSI/DELIVER project will assist with the development of a
logistics system which will track procurement, distribution and reporting for HIV test kits.
This could be included as an element under the Reproductive Health Distribution, Logistics
and Management Information System (RHDLMIS) that is organized and operated by the
RHU and already includes condoms and STI drugs. All VCT and MTCT activities will be
fully developed and scaled—up under the leadership and direction of staff from the NAS and
RHU.

Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (MTCT): Services to reduce MTCT transmission of
HIV are being developed by the NAS in collaboration with the RHU and the MOHP
Nutrition Unit with technical assistance from LINKAGES, Umoyo Network, CDC and.
UNICEF. Activities to support MTCT will closely follow those programmed for VCT
including development of national guidelines, training curricula, and monitoring system.
Logistics system needs that need to be explored and supported include HIV test kits,
micronutrients and malaria drugs, and ARV drugs. In addition to working with CDC, Umoyo
Network and J SI/DELIVER, technical assistance and support will continue to be provided
from the LINKAGES Project.

Home—based Care (HBC): An assessment of HBC services that was carried out by Umoyo
Network in 2000 identiﬁed many deﬁciencies and made recommendations for improvements.
The COPE Project along with Umoyo Network has supported the redesign of the HBC
manual and the piloting of patient kits that include basic supplies like soap and basic
medicines such as ORS. District Partnership Grantees and Umoyo Network sub—grantees are
planning to scale—up HBC activities in their targeted areas. These partners will work under
the direction of the NAS Care and Support Unit to develop standardized training and
commodity procurement activities. Umoyo Network will facilitate this process. If additional
technical assistance is needed it can be requested through CDC and/or PHI/IMPACT. Future
activities will be guided by assessments of the activities presently underway.

 

Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI): IMCI is a holistic approach of
managing common and usually fatal, but easily preventable, childhood illnesses. IMCI aims
at reducing childhood morbidity and mortality by targeting speciﬁc childhood components of
primary health care and linking with other health services. The three components of IMCI
are: improving the skills of health workers in classifying, treating, and counseling the
caretaker; improving the health system to ensure availability of essential drugs, reorganize
patient ﬂow, improve triage and care at referral sites, and quality monitoring and supervision;
and, improving family and community practices to promote health, prevent disease and
establish strong links between the home and health care system. Activities to date have
included training and coordination of IMCI activities in the four pilot districts. With the
expansion of the program underway, the personnel are inadequate and the section is under-
equipped to carryout training, monitoring and supervision countrywide. There is need to
support the point person and the Task Force to train more trainers and expand support staff,
transportation, and printing of training and reference materials.

Because of the activities already undertaken by the CHAPS districts, the MOHP and the Task
Force intend to use them as models for scaling up of IMCI nationally. With technical
assistance from the USAID/W Quality Assurance Project, the lessons learned. in improving
and maintaining the quality of IMCI services will be documented and disseminated.

o Tuberculosis: USAID plans to support TB activities at the national level by providing
technical assistance and commodities through the KNVB (the Royal Netherlands
Tuberculosis Association) under the USAID/W TB Coalition Project. Additional funds
will be channeled through the District Partnerships Grants for training, service delivery
and supervision related to TB. Innovative BCC messages and community—based activities
will also be pilot—tested and best practices will be shared with other districts.

New Activities: Supporting Intermediate Results (SIR)

The four Key Intermediate Results described above directly contribute to the achievement of
the Strategic Objective and the adoption of improved health behaviors by the ultimate
customers at the village level. They focus on services to communities, households and
individuals. In order to provide social marketing of health products, information on behavior
change, increased participation of community members in health activities, and quality health

services, there need to be adequate support systems functioning at district and central levels
and adequate stafﬁng. In addition to this capacity to manage, the requisite policies and health
reforms are needed to reinforce and facilitate the implementation of the priority health
activities. The three Intermediate Results (IR) described in. this section focus on activities at
the district and central levels and are considered essential to the achievement of the four KIRs
and SOS.

E. IR 8.5 Planning and Management Capacity Strengthened

In order to deliver good quality health services at health care facilities and through
community and BCI interventions, the management capacity and the ability to plan,
supervise, monitor and evaluate activities and staff must be strengthened at all. of the partner
implementing agencies. USAID provides technical assistance and support to the NAS and
RHU, Planning Services Unit, and Community Health Services Unit (CHSU) at the central
level of the MOHP. District Health Management Teams and District AIDS Coordinating
Committees are supported in districts where CHAPS and COPE projects are working.
Umoyo Network provides speciﬁc institution building support to 12 local NGO sub-grantees
and also assists PVOs and the MOHP to improve their management capacity. Under IR 8.5,
USAID will continue to provide technical assistance and local cost support to improve
management and strengthen the institutional capacity of all the implementing partners.

Indicative activities described below include on-going activities that will be continued and
expanded depending on availability of funds.

0 Strengthening the RHU Reproductive Health Distribution and Logistics Management
Information System (RHDLMIS): USAID will continue to provide technical
assistance and support to upgrade the Contraceptive Distribution and Logistics
Management Information System (CDLMIS) to a more comprehensive, integrated
RHDLMIS. The ﬁrst upgrade, which is already underway, is the addition of STI
drugs to the system. Over the next few years other RH commodities such as HIV test
kits, antenatal supplies and ARVs might be added to the system. USAID funding will
support training and supervision of health workers who are implementing the
RHLMIS.

0 Strengthening the National AIDS Secretaiiat (NAS): Capacity building activities with
the NAS focus on technical assistance and support to fully develop and implement the
national Behavior Change Communication (BCC) Strategy with the BCC Unit and
the national HIV/AIDS Monitoring System with the Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) Unit. USAID/W cooperating agencies are providing long-term advisors for
BCC (FHI/IMPACT Project) and short-term advisors, training, and local cost support
for M&E (Measure 11) and analysis of HIV-related data from the 2000 Malawi DHS
(Measure 1). Following the assistance provided in the development of the National
HIV/AIDS Framework, the POLICY II Project will continue to provide technical
assistance to ﬁnalize the National HIV/AIDS Policy, and will support advocacy,
policy development and capacity building activities with the NAS and other key

partners in the government, non-government and private sectors. CDC will. provide
support for surveillance activities as well as technical assistance related to VCT,
MTCT, care and support activities. While CDC funding under the LIFE Initiative is
separate from and additional to those available from USAID, CDC technical advisers
will work directly with USAID to coordinate their support to the NAS.

0 Strengthening District Health Management Teams (DHMT): The District
Partnerships Grants under the CHAPS project will be extended under this IR to
continue capacity building activities with the partner DHMTs and to consolidate the
improvements being made in district management systems under the CHAPS project.
As the decentralization process unfolds through the Ministry of Local Government
and District Assemblies, additional needs will be identiﬁed and supported directly
through the NGO partners or with technical assistance from the USAID/G
Partnerships in Health Reform project.

0 Strengthening District AIDS Coordinating Committees (DACCs): The District
Partnerships Grants under the CHAPS project will provide support to the DACCs in
the target districts for planning and budgeting and design of HIV/AIDS activities
under the newly developed District AIDS Plans. The POLICY II Project will also
provide support to assess the needs of the DACCs and develop activities to improve
their management capacity and implementation effectiveness. As the DACCs gain
more experience in development, implementation and monitoring of district AIDS
activities, appropriate support and technical assistance will be identiﬁed and provided.

0 Strengthening NGOs: Umoyo Network will continue to award sub—grants to local.
NGOs to support provision of RH and HIV/AIDS services. These NGOs will
continue to need additional support for institutional development and capacity
building. Technical assistance and training in ﬁnancial management, administration,
monitoring and evaluation will be supported. Umoyo Network will. also support the
development of a network of local and international NGOs working in. health in
Malawi. They will target four Malawian HIV networking organizations (MANASO,
MANET+, NAPHAM and MACRO) to strengthen their capacity to provide assistance
to other local NGOs and CBOs.

F. IR 8.6 Human Resources Recruitment and Management Strengthened

Malawi’s health sector is currently experiencing what key sector representatives have termed
a “human resource crisis.” The present shortage of health personnel and acute deﬁcit of
nurses, in particular, is a major hindrance to the development and provision of quality health
care services in the country. In response to this critical situation, the MOHP developed a
Health Sector Human Resources Plan 1999-2004. This detailed document includes sections
on current personnel distribution, attrition rates, numbers of graduates from training
institutions, additional needs given current authorized and recommended establishments,
current human resource policies in place in the MOHP and CHAM, and recommendations for

further action. Under IR 8.6, USAID will provide technical support to assist the MOHP to
implement several components of its National Human Resource Development (HRD) Plan.
This technical assistance will focus on: strengthening the pre—service education system;
developing a national training policy and plan; developing a national deployment policy and
plan; and strengthening strategies to enhance perfomrance.

1. Strengthen Pre-service Education System

The MOHP’s immediate priority is to increase the number of human resources available in
the health sector, with a particular focus on the nursing/midwifery cadre. Indicative
activities include:

0 Increase the number of Dre-service institutions capable of preparing health personnel
to provide high quality RH services: USAID will, expand its current program to
include the remaining seven CHAM training institutions where support is not
currently being provided. Speciﬁc program activities will contribute to strengthening
CHAM clinical training sites, strengthening faculty clinical and teaching capabilities,
updating and revising curricular content and incorporating a competency—based
training approach for clinical training.

 

0 Strengthen program for preparing nurse tutors: USAID will support the nursing
education programs at Kamuzu College of Nursing and at Mzuzu University to
strengthen their clinical teaching methodology so that graduates have the necessary
clinical teaching skills to ensure quality health education for their students. In
addition, as an interim measure until the new nursing education graduates are
deployed, USAID will support training of selected nurse tutors in the competency-
based training approach.

0 Develop a structured clinical preceptor system: USAID will provide support to the
MOHP and other key stakeholders in the development of a program to institutionalize
the training of clinical preceptors to better prepare them to work with students during
their clinical practica.

0 Strengthen midwifery education: USAID will support an assessment of the
underlying causes of the current shortage of functioning midwives and why nurses do
not want to pursue midwifery education. Recommendations will be developed for
subsequent implementation by the MOHP. USAID will also support the development
of a one-year curriculum for upgrading enrolled nurses to enrolled nurse/midwives.
This program will include strengthening faculty, adapting materials, and upgrading
clinical training sites.

0 Provide educational technology for all nurse training institutions: USAID will
support the establishment of Technology Assisted Learning Centers within the

libraries of the two campuses of the Kamuzu College of Nursing and the three
campuses of the Malawi College of Health Sciences, and possibly at Mzuzu

University, so that faculty, postgraduates, students and other health trainers from
attached clinical practica sites have the opportunity to access the latest health
information and teaching methodologies for use in their daily work.

0 Strengthen capacity of professional institutions: USAID will support activities to
strengthen the capacity of key regulatory bodies such as the Nurses and Midwives
Council, the Medical Council, the Training Division of the MOHP (and perhaps
representatives from the Ministry of Education) in conducting support supervision and
quality improvement ﬁinctions. USAID will continue to support work with the
professional associations to strengthen the registration system for their relevant health
professionals and will explore the possibilities of establishing continuing
education/relicensure schemes.

2. Develop National Training Policy and Plan

USAID will support a participatory process to develop a national training policy and plan that
takes into account national health priorities, provider knowledge and skills to meet national
pn'orities, appropriate functional staff mix to meet those priorities, as well. as current training
initiatives. These must be determined within the current health reform initiative and
commitment to devolve responsibility for human resource decisions to the district level. The
development process will also entail a market analysis of public and private sector capacity to
absorb new human resources produced by training institutions, needs of current staff for
short—term in—service training and prospects for career development. The national training
policy and plan will provide the guidance for determining training priorities and the resources
necessary to support those decisions.

0 Conduct stakeholder and market analysis

0 Develop training policy and plan and disseminate: USAID will support the
groundwork necessary (consensus building activities at the central. and district levels)
for subsequent implementation.

0 Develop Training Information Monitoring System (TIMS): USAID will. support the
continued development of a computer-based tool to track, and monitor training efforts,
information that will supplement service information for policy decisions regarding
deployment, training and performance support.

3. Develop National Deployment Policy and Plan

USAID will support a participatory process to develop a national deployment training
policy and plan including elements of planning, performance support and dissemination.

0 Conduct planning activities for deployment policy and plan development: The
planning stage considers the national epidemiological. proﬁle, population profile and
distribution, and captures both central and district perspectives human resource needs.

A negotiated process (i.e. central and district perspectives) will determine placements,
incentive policies, promotion policies, and conditions of services (basic salary,
beneﬁts, and incentives). Advocacy activities including a stakeholder analysis to
determine whether strategies are in place to support a systematic deployment policy
and plan.

Identify performance support strategies for inclusion in the deployment plan: The
national deployment plan will identify strategies that strengthen the environment to
improve and support the performance of health personnel and thus put into place
mechanisms to increase staff retention and decrease absenteeism and wastage. Such
strategies include support supervision, in-service training, performance and quality
improvement processes, transparent performance appraisal system, and career
development. These strategies are particularly important given the reality of working
conditions and staff protection in light of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Develop and disseminate deployment policy and plan: USAID will support the
groundwork necessary (consensus building activities at the central and district levels)

for subsequent implementation by the MOHP.

4. Strengthen Performance Support Strategies

USAID will support the introduction of select performance support strategies on a very small
scale, and will most likely phase in its support beginning with those districts where USAID-
funded activities are currently ongoing.

Expand support supervision: USAID will work with the District Health Ofﬁcers,
nurse managers and clinical trainers to develop a systematic approach to supervision
focusing on the goal of providing high quality services.

Strengthen the in-service training system: USAID will support strengthening of the
in-service training system in line with the national training plan with an eye towards
developing a more effective and efﬁcient system that meets the needs of the health
sector at the local service delivery level.

Initiate performance and quality improvement processes: USAID will support an
initiative to strengthen service delivery sites to provide quality reproductive health
services consistent with established standards and guidelines.

G. IR 8.7 Health Reform Implemented

The National Health Plan of 1999-2004 set the stage for the rollout of several, health reform
activities and the introduction of the Sector—wide Approach (SWAp) for the health and
population sector. Although USAID will not be able to provide direct funding in a basket of
co—mingled donor funds, several areas of health reform will be supported. directly with
technical assistance, training and local cost support. Support for the Essential Health

Package and Decentralization are already included under the CHAPS project and these
activities which have been described earlier under KIR 8.4 and IR 8.5 will be continued
under S08. Human Resources activities are also an important health reform component and
USAID support for this element is described under IR 8.6. Hospital Autonomy is another
health reform area for which USAID has provided technical assistance for initial, studies and
planning. The next activities will focus on improving the management systems at two central
hospitals and plans are already being developed to fully address this issue with technical
assistance from Partnerships in Health Reform (PHR). As the Quality Assurance Task Force
becomes fully operational and develops strategies to include QA in the plans of the other
health reform groups, USAID will provide technical assistance, training and local cost
support to incorporate the principal and practices of QA as appropriate. Support will
continue to be channeled through the USAID/W Quality Assurance Project.

VII. Objective Criteria and Process for Activity Selection

The indicative activities described above are important but at this point are not all-inclusive.
The selection of activities to be funded under the 808 program must carefully consider the
relevance of activities to achieving results in such a way that contributes effectively to the
Objective. The following is a list of initial criteria for use in selecting activities to be funded
under this Objective.

1. Relative Importance of the Activity to Achievement of the Key Intermediate Result(s')

The Activities presented above may not necessarily be equal in terms of their contribution
towards achievement of one or more of the Key Intermediate Results. The SOS Program will
therefore consider the contribution of the various Activities to the achievement of the Key
Intermediate Results in the allocation of Program resources.

2. Ongoing Commitments

The process of democratic consolidation and entrenching a culture of accountability and
transparency is a long-term undertaking, and sustainable results are often. unachievable within
traditional short-term activity horizons. Further investment in activities initiated under the
STAF H and CHAPS Project Activities should be considered where these activities contribute
as much as alternative investments to the achievement of Strategic Objective 8.

3. Changing Priorities (USAID and GOM)

Both USAID’s and the GOM’s priorities in the democracy and governance sector will. evolve.
The 808 Program will be responsive to this evolution and adapt activities accordingly.

.4 1mm 1 -—- .4nzp/[fied De’SC'I‘UJINJII

 

4. Managing for Results

The Program will monitor activity performance and adjust selection criteria and Program
focus accordingly. Factors such as Program progress in achieving results, appropriateness of
technical approach, cost—effectiveness, etc, will be considered.

5. Linkages with USAID Activities

308 is one of four new Strategic Objectives addressed by USAID. Opportunities will be
available to promote and beneﬁt from linkages with the Objectives in the sectors of
Sustainable Economic Growth (SO6), Democracy/Governance (S07), and Education (809).

6. Linkages with Partner Donor Activities

The GOM and USAID have several other donor partners engaged in the achievement of the
in investment in the Objective and Key Intermediate Results. Activity selection will attempt
to capitalize on donor coordination and comparative advantage of the respective donors with.
a view to maximizing the total impact of donor investment in Malawi.

7. SOS Program Activity Selection Process

The $07 Team (See Section VIII) will deﬁne the broader priorities within the Results
Framework on an ongoing basis, and determine criteria for activity selection, how they will
be applied, and by whom.

VIII. Roles and Responsibilities of the Parties.

USAID: USAID will, with program funds, provide the technical and administrative
personnel required to implement the activities noted above. USAID will also provide, with
program funds, locally hired USAID staff required to manage and monitor the Program in
compliance with USAID regulations and procedures. USAID will also support long-term.
technical advisors who will work directly with GOM and NGO implementing agencies to
develop program activities and introduce new technologies for reproductive and child health,
and HIV/AIDS. USAID will also play a leadership role in coordinating the HIV/AIDS inputs
of other USG agencies including CDC, and the Departments of State, Labor, Defense, Health
and Human Resources, and Commerce.

GOM: The Program expects to work with a number of GOM entities, but principally the
Ofﬁce of the Vice President, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health and Population, the
National AIDS Secretariat and the Medical Council and Nursing and Midwives Council of
Malawi. The GOM will provide operating expenses for these and any other GOM entities that
USAID agrees to work with to accomplish Program results. Furthermore, the GOM will
ensure that appropriate staff of these entities provide appropriate levels of participation in

coordination and management of the Program (see below).

SOS Team: The SOS Program will form Results Activity Teams to guide, monitor and
advise in the implementation of activities. Initially, the SOS Team will be established
comprised of USAID personnel, two GOM representatives, and one PVO/NGO
representative. As the Results Activities are ﬁnalized and approved, RA teams will be
established with representatives from USAID, the GOM, PVO/NG-O partners, and
Cooperating Agencies.

IX. Monitoring and Evaluation

Performance Monitoring Plan: The SOS Program monitoring and evaluation system will be
deﬁned by a Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP) which the SOS Resident Assistant teams
will use to plan and manage the collection, analysis, reporting and use of the perfomtance
data. The PMP will be for internal use of the SOS Program, although parts of the system will
be used to report to outsiders (GOM, USAID/Malawi, United States Government) on
program performance and achievements. The SOS Team is responsible for the development
and implementation of the PMP. An SOS PMP should be in, place within six-months of the
signing of the Strategic Objective Agreement.

Data Collection and Reporting: Performance monitoring will be an important feature of
the contracts and grant agreements awarded under the SOS Agreement. The collection and
reporting of data will be a critical role performed by many SOS Team members and
implementing partners. Collection and reporting of data will be done by all parties in,
accordance with the PMP.

X. Other Implementation Issues

Coordination with $03 STAFH, CHAPS and COPE: The STAFH, CHAPS and COPE
Programs, while funded under separate agreements, will be managed in, conjunction with new
activities funded under the SOS Program Grant Agreement. The SOS Team will design the
modalities for this management.

Coordination with Other Donors: The importance of good coordination and collaboration
with other donors is a key to the successful implementation of SOS activities. Several
coordinating mechanisms are in place to assure that all donors are working together to
support the programs under the National Health Plan and the HIV/AIDS Framework and
Agenda for Action. USAID will actively participate in the quarterly meetings of the
Reproductive Health Coordinating Committee, and the Minister of Health and Population
Joint Implementation Plan (JIP) Reviews. The SO 8 Team Leader will attend monthly
meetings of the Donor Coordination Sub-group for Health and Population, while the
HIV/AIDS Team Leaders will participate in the monthly HIV/AIDS Technical Working
Group (TWG) meetings and in appropriate HIV/AIDS Task Forces.

(e) In the event of a disagreement about the application of an exemption, the

Section B.5. Reports and Information, Agreement Books and Records, Audits,
and Inspections.

(a) Reports and Information. The Grantee shall furnish USAID accounting records
and such other information and reports relating to the Agreement as USAID may
reasonably request.

(b) Grantee Agreement Books and Records. The Grantee shall maintain accounting
books, records, documents and other evidence relating to the Agreement, adequate to
show, without limitation, all costs incurred by the Grantee under the Agreement, the
receipt and use of goods and services acquired under the Agreement by the Grantee,
agreed-upon cost sharing requirements, the nature and extent of solicitations of
prospective suppliers of goods and services acquired by the Grantee, the basis of
award of Grantee contracts and orders, and the overall progress of the Agreement
toward completion ("Agreement books and records"). The Grantee shall maintain
Agreement books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles prevailing in the United States, or at the Grantee's option, with, approval by
USAID, other accounting principles, such as those ( 1) prescribed by the International
Accounting Standards Committee (an afﬁliate of the International Federation of
Accountants) or (2) prevailing in the country of the Grantee. Agreement books and
records shall be maintained for at least three years after the date of last disbursement
by USAID or for such longer period, if any, required to resolve any litigation, claims
or audit ﬁndings.

(c) Grantee Audit. If $300,000 or more of USAID funds are expended directly by the
Grantee in its ﬁscal year under the Agreement, the Grantee shall have ﬁnancial audits
made of the expenditures in accordance with the following terms, except as the Parties
may otherwise agree in writing:

(1) With USAID approval, the Grantee shall use its Supreme Audit Institution
or select an independent auditor in accordance with the "Guidelines for
Financial Audits Contracted by Foreign Recipients" issued by the USAID
Inspector General ("Guidelines"), and the audits shall be performed in
accordance with the "Guidelines"; and

(2) The audit shall determine whether the receipt and expenditure of the funds
provided under the Agreement are presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles agreed to in section (b) above and whether the
Grantee has complied with the terms of the Agreement. Each audit shall be
completed no later than nine months after the close of the Grantee's year under
audit.

(d) Subrecipient Audits. The Grantee, except as the Parties may otherwise agree in
writing, shall submit to USAID, in form and substance satisfactory to USAID, a plan
for the audit of the expenditures of "covered" subrecipients, as deﬁned below, that
receive funds under this Agreement pursuant to a direct contract or agreement with
the Grantee.

(l) A "covered" subrecipient is one who expends $300,000 or more in its
ﬁscal year in "USAID awards" (i.e., as recipients of USAID cost reimbursable
contracts, grants or cooperative agreements and as sub—recipients under
USAID strategic objective and other grant agreements with foreign
governments).

(2) The plan shall describe the methodology to be used by the Grantee to
satisfy its audit responsibilities for covered subrecipients. The Grantee may
satisfy such audit responsibilities by relying on independent audits of the
subrecipients; expanding the scope of the independent ﬁnancial audit of the
Grantee to encompass testing of subrecipients’ accounts; or a combination of
these procedures.

(3) The plan shall identify the funds made available to covered subrecipients
that will be covered by audits conducted in accordance with other audit
provisions that would satisfy the Grantee‘s audit responsibilities. (A. nonproﬁt
organization organized in the United States is required to arrange for its own
audits. A for-proﬁt contractor organized in the United States that has a direct
contract with USAID is audited by the cognizant US. Government Agency. A
private voluntary organization, organized outside the United States with a
direct grant from USAID is required to arrange for its own audits. A host—
country contractor should be audited by the Grantee’s auditing agency.)

(4) The Grantee shall ensure that covered subrecipients under direct contracts
or agreements with the Grantee take appropriate and timely corrective actions;
consider whether subrecipients‘ audits necessitate adjustment of its own
records; and require each such subrecipient to permit independent auditors to
have access to records and ﬁnancial statements as necessary.

(e) Audit Reports. The Grantee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to USAID an
audit report for each audit arranged for by the Grantee in accordance with this Section
within 30 days after completion of the audit and no later than. nine months after the
end of the period under audit.

(f) Other Covered Subrecipients. For "covered" subrecipients who receive funds under
the Agreement pursuant to direct contracts or agreements with USAID, USAID will
include appropriate audit requirements in such contracts or agreements and will, on
behalf of the Grantee, conduct the follow—up activities with regard to the audit reports
furnished pursuant to such requirements.

(g) Cost of Audits. Subject to USAID approval in writing, costs of audits performed
in accordance with the terms of this Section may be charged to the Agreement.

of the audit requirement.

(i) Opportunity to Audit or Inspect. The Grantee shall afford authorized
representatives of USAID the opportunity at all reasonable times to audit or inspect
activities ﬁnanced under the Agreement, the utilization of goods and services ﬁnanced
by USAID, and books, records and other documents relating to the Agreement.

(j) Subrecipient Books and Records. The Grantee will incorporate paragraphs (a), (b),
(d), (e), (g), (h) and (i) of this provision into all subagreements with. non-US.
organizations which meet the $300,000 threshold of paragraph (c) of this provision.
Subagreements with non-US. organizations, which do not meet the $300,000
threshold, shall, at a minimum, incorporate paragraphs (h) and (i) of this provision.
Subagreements with US. organizations shall state that the US. organization is subject
to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A- 133.
