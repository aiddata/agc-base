PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In 2007 the Norwegian Government signed an agreement with the Government of Malawi and
the Mulanje Conservation Trust (MMCT) to support MMCT’s implementation of the Mulanje
Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project (MMBCP) during 2008 to 2012. This mid-term
review (MTR) is carried out to assess progress towards reaching the objectives of the MMBCP to
date and to suggest measures for corrective action.

The MTR Team, Dr Poul Wisborg (Team Leader) and Dr Charles B. L. Jumbe, carried out the
review, primarily through meetings with key stakeholders and field visits to projects during the
period 13 to 24 September 2010. This report presents the observations and views of the
independent reviewers. The draft report was forwarded for comments by major stakeholders on 8
October 2010 and the comments received have been reviewed when completing this final report.

The MTR Team would like to extend its sincere thanks to all individuals, organisations and
communities who shared their insights and views with us during meetings and field visits. We are
particularly thankful to Executive Director Carl Bruessow and other MMCT staff for their
assistance in carrying our work, including an instructive and enjoyable hike on the Mulanje
Mountain. We also thank Augustin Chikuni of the Norwegian Embassy for helpful assistance
during the preparation of the programme for the review. Thanks are also due to the MMCT Board
of Trustees for allowing the Team to make a presentation of the preliminary findings at the
MMTC Board Meeting held on 23 September 2010. The Board gave the Team valuable feedback
on the initial insights from the review.

The MTR Team expresses the hope that the report will be a constructive contribution to the
learning and development process required to move towards fair and sustainable management of
the important and fascinating natural resources and environmental qualities of the Mulanje
Mountain.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Mulanje Mountain, located in south-eastern Malawi, is a unique mountain massif with highly
valuable environment, natural resources and biodiversity which play a signiﬁcant role in the lives
of the more than a hundred thousand people who live in its immediate surroundings and which
have received global recognition. Mulanje Mountain presents formidable challenges of
sustainable and equitable natural resource conservation and use.

The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust (MMCT) was established around 1994 by individuals
who were concerned about the environmental degradation of Mulanje Mountain forest resources
and biodiversity and saw opportunities for obtaining funding through the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF) created at the Rio Conference of 1992 for establishing an endowment fund to
support conservation activities on the mountain. MMCT’s main role is to undertake biodiversity
conservation, research and livelihoods activities related to the Mulanje Mountain. MMCT is
registered by the Government of Malawi as an independent trust and governed by a multi-
stakeholder board representing government and civil society.

The Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project (MMCBP) was approved in 2000 for
GEF funding through the World Bank and implemented from 2002 to 2008 with a budget of
US$6.75 million, of which US$55 million was for capitalising an endowment fund. The
objectives of the project are to (i) maintain the vital watershed of the Mulanje massif, head water
for nine rivers, (ii) beneﬁt local communities by establishing sustainable management of the
forest resources through cooperation between the Forest Department and local authorities and
communities, and (iii) preserve the globally signiﬁcant biodiversity and unique ecosystems of the
Mulanje massif.

In August 2007 MMCT applied for support from the Government of Norway. An agreement was
signed between the Government of Malawi, the Government of Norway and MMCT in
November 2007 about funding of the MMBCP during 2008 to 2012 to a value of NOK 20.5
million (about MK 640 million).

This mid-term review (MTR) of the MMBCP is carried out for the Norwegian Government in
order to assess progress towards reaching the objectives of the MMBCP to date, the relevance,
effectiveness and sustainability of the project achievements, assessment of any risks and threats,
and to suggest corrective measures.

During the period reviewed (2008—2010) MMCT has made acceptable progress towards attaining
programme objectives, although progress is uneven and the outcomes and impact of some of the
interventions are hard to conﬁrm.

Objective 1: Maintain Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, including globally significant biodiversity
and vital ecological services.

MMCT and partners, particularly the Forestry Department, are carrying out a range of important
conservation activities. These include: eradication of invasive alien species, making and
maintenance of ﬁre breaks and other ﬁre prevention activities, rejuvenation of indigenous forest
with emphasis on the endemic Mulanje cedar, which is of high biodiversity, commercial and
symbolic value, and law enforcement. Satisfactory progress has been made with regard to

Xii

activities and outputs. However, in some respects the effectiveness of the interventions in
achieving the desired impact (of for example ﬁre protection and removal invasive species) is hard
to ascertain. Again, tendencies towards militarization of the approach to law enforcement are
expensive and unsustainable and contradict efforts in embracing community participation in
forest management under the forest co-management sub-component of the project.

Objective 2.‘ Increase awareness, understanding and appreciation of the value of the Mulanje
Mountain ecosystem at local and national levels.

MMCT and partners have rolled out a diverse and intense information and education campaign
and MMCT is highly visible in the area and has promoted the recognition of Mount Mulanje as a
tourist destination and biodiversity value. The resource use and proliﬁc activity under this
component may appear too high compared to the wider programme. In particular, the Review
Team ﬁnds that the information campaigns appear to be delinked from materially important
efforts in conservation, livelihoods and forest co-management. The Team did not feel convinced
that there was a genuine effort to learn from communities, to embrace or negotiate with their
values and knowledge of the mountain or to contribute to behavioural change and conﬂict
resolution among different stakeholders.

Objective 3: Improve sustainability of biological resource use and enhance the value of the
Mulanje Mountain ecosystem to local communities.

Forest co-management is a central programme that corresponds to one of the main development
objectives and has its foundation in the Forest Policy of Malawi (1996) and the Forest Act
(1997). The project was slow in taking off due to lack of understanding between MMCT and
government forestry ofﬁcials, and progress continues to be unsatisfactory. By March 2008, only
six forest co-management agreements had been signed and another two under preparation. The
MTR Team observed that residents who have functional agreements enjoy rights to collection of
ﬁre wood, thatch grass and beekeeping which support their livelihoods. Communities were more
active in forest protection and development, and illegal and unsustainable use of the forest
resources in the areas concerned had reportedly gone down. A number of problems have been
observed, however. The overarching issue was the exclusion of three communities in Phalombe
from land about which they had signed forest co-management agreements with the government in
2008. This is related to a mistake the Forestry Department made later in 2008 of issuing an eco-
tourism concession to the owners of Thuchila Estate in Phalombe district, concerning the same
forest land. Since 2009, villagers have been threatened with arms and hindered from accessing
their land except against payment of fees to the estate owners. As such, the villagers are neither
able to exercise their rights nor to carry out management and protection activities. There are
reports that the forest is in a deteriorating state due to illegal harvesting and increased number of
ﬁres. In the view of the MTR Team, this development undermines the efforts to engage
communities in forest management. Inability to resolve this conﬂict diligently will make it
untenable to justify further extension of the co-forest management activities to other villages
surrounding the Mulanje Mountain and even raises the question about the justiﬁcation for
continued funding of the project under review.

Other, mainly agriculture based, livelihoods are supported through a wide range of activities in
villages surrounding the Mulanje Mountain. These contribute to the incomes and security of

xiii

many individuals and households, but the impact at village and higher levels is poorly
documented. The Team has the impression is that the programme needs serious up-scaling.
Complementary interventions on marketing and entrepreneurship are needed for the communities
to benefit fully from the livelihoods interventions. This is now planned through a USAID funded
programme, which will enable MMCT to re-allocate Norwegian funds earmarked for livelihood
activities to other programmes. The extent to which the USAID livelihood project will be linked
to sustainable natural resource management is unclear. The Team suggests that livelihood
interventions should be used as an incentive for cooperation in participatory forest management.
There is a general need to increase, and document, the economic benefits to communities and
individuals of all interventions.

Objective 4: Establish long-term income stream and institutional capacity to ensure continuation
of the above ﬁrst objectives.

The MMCT core ofﬁce in Mulanje has a small, competent and dynamic leader and staff who
often go beyond the call of duty in carrying out the project activities. Several observers expressed
admiration for the organisation for its performance and creativity. The Review Team notes that
the programmes are demanding on MMCT and its partners. As project activities expand in scope,
geographical coverage and complexity, the agency and willingness of the staff to take additional
responsibilities need to be compensated with excellent working conditions commensurate with
educational qualifications and experience.

A major achievement of MMCT is to attract international donor funding for a range of activities
involving different partners. The Norwegian funding has contributed directly to a number of
partners and indirectly through enhancing the credibility and leverage of MMCT network.
MMCT gets credit from these partners for being creative and ﬂexible in supporting capacity
building. While the multi-stakeholder network approach enhances the capacity of the MMCT, it
also entails dependence on the commitment and capacity of those partners.

MMCT has proposed the creation of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) to improve the autonomy,
sustainability and efﬁciency of the governance of Mulanje Mountain and to improve local
retention of revenues. However, the Department of Forestry has reservations about the proposed
PPP, particularly concerning the degree of control over the Forest Reserve and incomes generated
from it, considering the Department’s legal mandate over all forestry reserves in the country. The
MTR Team notes that the delay in completing a national policy process concerning PPPs is used
to justify slow progress in raising and retaining revenues from the Mulanje Mountain. The Team
also observes that Forestry Department headquarters decisions concerning resource use and
management (issuance of concessions, permits for Cedar extraction etc.) may disempower local
forestry staff and MMCT. Although the collaborative relations within MMCT network have, in
general, improved in the period reviewed, the MTR Team finds that the involvement of District
Commissioners, District Council and various officials at the district level is given too little
attentlon.

Objective 5: Demonstrate the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as ﬁnancing
mechanism for biodiversity conservation.

From April 2005 MMCT has held in trust an endowment fund of US$5.45 million on behalf of
the Malawian people. The Project Proposal to the Norwegian Government expected the fund to
reach US$8.3 million by 2012, on the assumption of a 7.5% rate of return. Withdrawing 5.5%
would then yield US$450 000 per year for operations from 2012-2013. Due in part to ﬁnancial
instability the growth of the fund has been considerably less. By September 2010, the fund had
grown to US$62 million. The MTR ﬁnds that while fund management appears to have been
good, the persistent problem of a high inﬂation level in Malawi undermining asset and yield
growth appears to have been underestimated. From 2005 to 2009 average inﬂation in Malawi has
been about 10% and average depreciation against the US dollar about 5% per year so that the
purchase power of the fund is steadily undermined by an effective inﬂation of about 5% per year.
High inﬂation still poses a major challenge to making the endowment fund the source of an
adequate and sustainable funding stream. The MTR Team agrees that there is a need to secure
rapid injections in the endowment fund and that a substantially higher total endowment is
required based on more cautious assessments of the effective annual yield.

MMCT displays major strengths as a dynamo of a multi-stakeholder network addressing a
vacuum of capacity in resource management. It is highly relevant in the context of Malawian,
Norwegian and international policies concerning biodiversity conservation and natural resource
based livelihoods.

Since its inception MMCT has contributed strongly to funding innovative collaboration, research,
management interventions, environmental awareness promoting conservation of biodiversity and
other natural resources on Mulanje Mountain. MMCT has built a small but competent
organisation with a disproportionate impact on the visibility of the resources and environmental
values of Mulanje Mountain.

The project activities are of high relevance for current Malawian and Norwegian development
policies. This concerns, ﬁrst of all, the conservation and use of natural resources including
biodiversity. It is relevant for the Norwegian government’s interests in adaptation to climate
change, which is reﬂected in its support to the Lake Chilwa Basin Climate Change Adaptation
project and guidelines for future support to Bunda College. The MMBCP is relevant for the goals
of strengthening livelihoods and reducing poverty and thereby several of the Millennium
Development Goals and the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). It contributes
to fulﬁlling Malawi’s obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and seeks
to protect the biological, landscape and cultural signiﬁcance of the Mulanje Mountain, expressed
in its designation as Forest Reserve, Global Man and Biosphere Reserve (by UNESCO), IUCN
biodiversity hotspot, and the expected declaration of Mulanje Mountain as a World Heritage Site.

Overall, the MTR Team therefore ﬁnds that the decision by the Norwegian Government to
support the Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project is justiﬁed.

XV

The MTR has focused on the following challenges facing the MMCT network:

Institutional collaboration: One of the expectations of the Norwegian support to MMCT is to see
an improved relationship between MMCT and the Forestry Department. Discussions with various
stakeholders revealed that MMCT-Forest Department relations and cooperation has improved
substantially in the current phase, although some problems still remain. There is a perception in
the DFOs that MMCT has not embraced genuine joint planning with the FD. Since MMCT
controls the resources, there is a general tendency to dictate the frame or to take decisions
unilaterally. The MTR Team is also concerned about inadequate government funding to the
Forest Departments at district level for operations, which underpins dependency on MMCT.

Gender: Gender relations and equality impinge deeply on the issues studied, for example, women
are disproportionately affected by the increased workload of poor access to fire wood and
drinking water, high women’s participation in forestry programmes may reﬂect valuable
gendered concerns about sustainability and the health of the environment, but can also be
exploited as cheap labour. Discrimination against women in certain forms of decision-making,
such as in professional organisations, traditional leadership institutions is fairly widespread. The
Team observed no examples of attention to gender issues in the documents or activities reviewed,
including the approved Proposal Document 2007, up until the Annual Meetings with Norway
from 2009. Norwegian gender policy stresses political and economic participation, rights to
health and protection against violence. Gender is not an ‘added’ concern but central to
community and individual agency and empowerment that is inherent in participatory and
sustainable resource management. The MMCT Board is aware of the skewed gender balance of
staff and within Board membership, and has launched a gender strategy, although no
manifestations of this process were communicated to the MTR Team. Gender equality has been
neglected at all levels and need to be addressed through completing the gender strategy, making a
visible move towards gender equality in stafﬁng, and through pro-active, gender-aware
programming, operations and reporting.

Complexity and unresolved dynamics of resource governance and depletion. MMCT project
activities are addressing a complex intersection of ecological, social and economic factors and
seek to maintain a holistic approach. The biodiversity knowledge and skills of MMCT and the
national and international research it has stimulated, is impressive. The MTR Team nevertheless
ﬁnds that social science studies appear weakly integrated in programme design. As
acknowledged by the Executive Director, how to move from unsustainable resource utilisation to
sustainable use poses unresolved challenges. The MMCT mission is to ensure that the benefits
and costs of conservation and use are distributed equitably. Therefore, knowledge of power
relations and social dynamics, governance of land and water, gender and other forms of social
differentiation must inform programming. Resource economics, political economy and political
ecology offer relevant perspectives.

Conflict and law enforcement. The conﬂict level over resource extraction on Mulanje Mountain
is fairly high, and has involved a number of violent incidents in the period considered. MMCT on
a number of occasions called upon the armed staff of the police and of national parks authorities
to arrest illegal loggers and charcoal producers. MMCT also reports that it is sending its own and
forestry department staff for para-military training. A number of staff brought up the desire to

xvi

carry arms during ﬁeld operations. Current plans for the use of Norwegian funding include the
use of the Malawi Defence Forces in forest protection, which appears inappropriate in a
democratic society. There is good reason to warn against a further militarization of resource
management, as it contradicts efforts in trying to embrace local participation in forest
management through forest co-management as per the National Forestry Policy (1996).

Abuse of power: One of the challenges that MMCT in its efforts to implement the project
activities is the abuse of power to condone illegal harvesting of Mulanje timber and the exclusion
of villagers from co-management forest land after a private concession for eco-tourism
development was granted to Thuchila Estate on land managed under forest co-management
agreements without consulting the affected communities or taking their rights into account. The
abuse of power by the owners of Thuchila Estate, treating residents with arms, hindering them
from accessing the forest for rightful utilisation and forest protection, and privately charging
villagers fees for the use of public property, has persisted for too long and violates the agreements
on which the Norwegian support is founded.

The MTR Team suggests a number of recommendations:

1. MMCT should start the process of developing consensus and multi-stakeholder ownership
of a new strategy and programme proposal for the period beyond 2012. The Strategic Plan
2008-2012 clariﬂes areas of emphasis but is weak in analysis, presentation and operational
direction. MMCT needs to build on its ﬂexible and dynamic action capabilities to create a
critical learning approach where experience is systematically evaluated, reﬂected upon and
used in strategic planning and action. This includes substantially strengthening the
monitoring and evaluation system. The risk assessment and risk management strategies
should be reviewed and updated.

2. MMCT should maintain or speed up progress in reaching the objectives and improve
documentation and analysis of impact:

2. I. Biodiversity conservation, monitoring and research. Continue this important work with more
attention to sustainable utilisation, monitoring of impact and research on other species that can be
grown.

2.2. Environmental education and awareness. Integrate the diverse activities in this component
more closely with other programme activities and ensure that environmental education and
communication is part of a mutual learning process whereby MMCT and partners become
increasingly aware of the values, knowledge and capabilities of community members and groups.
The attention to impact, including on behaviour change and conﬂict resolution, should be
strengthened.

2.3. Forest management and livelihoods. As per targets, the Forest Co-management component
needs to be extended to larger areas, which requires that issues of collaboration, capacity and
implementation are resolved. The conﬂict concerning communities in Phalombe requires urgent
resolution to justify further extension of the programme and to avoid jeopardising MMCT
partnerships. There is need for integrated approach to livelihoods programmes that are linked to
forest co-management and to value chains and marketing, and for a plan to ensure that the
MOBI+LISE project complements forest co-management efforts.

2.4. Capacity building and income streams. MMCT should continue its commendable and
innovative role in developing the capacities of local partners and should increase the efforts to
identify income streams that can be channelled into conservation and livelihoods activities.
Reported new prospects for the Forestry Department to retain and reinvest revenue from the
Mulanje Mountain in management and conservation activities should be pursued. The MMTC
Board should discuss the further development of its proposal for a Public Private Partnership,
particularly with the Forestry Department, in order to be prepared for the situation when a policy
framework is in place. The MTR Team ﬁnds that in a decentralized governance perspective, the
involvement of District Commissioners, District Council and various ofﬁcials should be
strengthened and recommends the commissioning of a study to assess the effects and
implications of decentralized management of MMFR as an input to current planning.

MMCT and the MMCT Board should take bold steps to address challenges:

Improve relations and joint planning: Under the supervision of MMCT Board, the programme
staff in MMCT and Forestry Department should take steps to make their joint planning more
equal, transparent and mutually binding as a basis for improved and more cooperative
implementation.

Gender: MMCT urgently needs to complete the process of making a gender strategy, to include
female staff in senior programme and management functions and to promote gender equality and
solve gender specific needs and problems in all its operations.

Research: MMTC should maintain its commendable research efforts on biodiversity and
ecosystem management and its valuable networking and cooperation with reputed international
research institutions. The Mulanje mountain environment offers opportunities for studying
biological and other effects of climate change, historically and today. MMCT may consider
developing new national and international institutional collaboration for graduate students and
researchers, strengthening existing ecological work and developing research on, for example,
resource economics, gender, political economy and political ecology studies relevant for resource
governance and development in the Mulanje Mountain watershed. The Team recommends that
MMCT recruits a social scientist to coordinate and carry out social science research to
complement on-going natural science studies.

Law enforcement and conflict management: Militarization of conservation is not likely to be a
sustainable response to pressure on mountain resources and contradicts efforts to bring
communities into co-management. Where necessary, the use of armed force should be in the
hands of designated bodies only. The apparent shift towards utilising an increased share of the
Norwegian project funding for armed response measures should not be encouraged.

Abuse of power: Illegal forests utilisation and exclusion of Phalombe communities from co-
management forest land are major threats to project objectives and appear in breach of the 2007
Agreement about support to MMBCP, which requires that the Malawian Government must
cooperate fully to ensure that project goals are achieved and ‘take rapid legal action to stop,
investigate and prosecute in accordance with applicable law any person suspected of misuse of
resources or corruption’ (Article 11, clause 1). If the issue remains unresolved, the MTR Team
recommends that that the forest co-management programme in the Mulanje Mountain area is

xviii

discontinued from July 2011. The Team also recommends that the Norwegian government
carefully reviews the progress with regard to these two cases of apparent breach of the law before
committing funding for the next ﬁnancial year (2011-2012). The primary — and urgent — need is
that villagers get access to the forest land to which they were solemnly granted rights through the
ﬁrst Forest Co-management Agreements facilitated under the MMBCP project and signed by the
Malawian Government and the communities concerned on 25 March 2008.

Provided that challenges are addressed in a convincing manner, MMCT should get further
support to carry out its mission, which is long-term in nature.

Norwegian Government support. Subject to good performance, improved documentation of
impact, and success in addressing major challenges, the MTR Team 2010 recommends that the
Norwegian Government extends its support for a further ﬁve years from 2012-2016.

The endowment fund. Apart from supporting core activities, the Team recommends to the
Norwegian Government to consider providing more injections into MMCT endowment fund in
order to bring it to a level where the sustainable yield can fund core functions and essential
programmes. Since the assumptions underlying the size of the initial (and current) endowment
seriously under-estimated the effect of high inﬂation as well as market and currency risk, there is
a need to increase the fund, over time probably to ﬁve or siX times its current level. A ﬁrm
commitment concerning the total level of the grant to the endowment fund will give MMCT
predictability, while annual, performance based injections into the endowment fund could reserve
with the Norwegian Government a satisfactory measure of control aimed to ensure that the
direction, relevance and impact of MMCT programmes is satisfactory. The Team recommends
that MMCT and/or the Norwegian Government should pursue opportunities for pooling funding
from several donors, possibly using an early, positive commitment by Norway as leverage.
Malawian Government support. The Government of Malawi, through its central funding
allocations and through the Forest Department, should take a much stronger role in conserving
and developing natural resources and unique environmental, touristic and cultural qualities of
Mulanje Mountain and should recognise and reinforce the unique contribution that MMCT-led
multi-stakeholder network is making towards these objectives. The Government ought to increase
support to public agencies tasked to work with the protection of the Mulanje Mountain, and
MMCT Board and network should seek to inﬂuence policies and decisions to promote such
support. In a decentralized governance perspective, the involvement of District Commissioners,
District Council and various ofﬁcials should be strengthened.

In conclusion, Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust is a multi-stakeholder forum and actor that
represents high level governmental and public commitment to promote sustainable development
in the Mulanje Mountain watershed. It is probably the best opportunity that eXists to conserve and
enhance biodiversity and other natural resources on Mulanje Mountain while using them to
equitably beneﬁt surrounding communities. There are major challenges, including problematic
aspects of the chosen conservation approach and of power abuse. If MMCT can seriously address
these challenges during the completion of the current phase, and through its strategic planning
and programme development for a new phase, increased support will be justiﬁed. Such support
should be aimed to build the endowment fund to an adequate level and should be granted at the
substantially higher levels required by the environmental, livelihoods and socio-economic
challenges in the Mulanj e Mountain watershed.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. THE CONTEXT

Malawi does not have a wealth of mineral resources to stir economic development except for the
soil on which crops and trees grow for people to survive on. For centuries, agriculture has been
(and remains) the mainstay of Malawi’s economy. Currently, it supports 80% of the country’s
population of 13 million people and contributes 39% of the gross domestic product (GDP). It
accounts for 83% of export earnings and employs 85% of the labour force (Malawi Government
2009). The population depends on natural resource biomass for their livelihood and household
energy and more than 90% of the population depend on fuel wood and charcoal for cooking and
heating (N SO 2008), even those who have access to electricity, due to the cost of electricity and
electric appliances. Rural and urban households respectively account for about 60% and 10% of
total annual wood consumption estimated at 8.5 million cubic meters, the rest is consumed by the
commercial sector (Malawi Government 2001). The importance of natural resource to the
economy and human livelihoods has led the government to put in place policies for the
management of natural resources.

1.2. MULANJE MOUNTAIN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECT

Mulanje Mountain is the highest mountain in south-central Africa and located in south-eastern
Malawi (map page vii). It covers about 650km2 surrounded by villages from two districts,
Phalombe and Mulanje, small-scale cultivation, and tea estates. Its precipitous ﬂanks rise from an
average of 700m to 3 000m above sea level. There is a marked difference in the annual
geographic distribution of rainfall ranging from about 300mm in the rain shadow of the massif’ s
southwest section to almost 3 000mm on the Lichenya Plateau. Mulanje Mountain is an
important site of biodiversity containing unique Mulanje cedar and other endemic plant and
animal species (MMCT 2006). The massif’s vegetation varies with altitude, relief, aspect, rock
form, soils, and incidence of fire and ranges from the miombo woodlands dominated by
Brachystegia species to afro-montane forests and grass lands.

The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve (MMFR) was gazetted in 1927 in order to safeguard the
water catchment and to control the extraction of Mulanje Cedar. Along with the creation of tea
estates, this led to the displacement of many people . In rural areas where wage employment and
other chances of escaping poverty are limited, people living on the fringes of the mountain
exploit the natural resources to derive their livelihood from selling timber, ﬁrewood and charcoal.
Land scarcity and high population densities /estimated at 208 and 166 persons per km2 in
Mulanje and Phalombe) are among the contributing factors (N SO 2008). In addition, exploitation
of the commercially valuable forest by economic elites, sometimes in collusion with government
officials, has played a significant role. As a result, the MMFR has been reduced in terms of size
and natural resources (World Bank 2001). Concerns over the extinction of endemic ﬂora and
fauna and illegal logging of the precious Mulanje Cedar and other indigenous species were
motivating concerns for individuals, including scholars at Zomba James Seyani, Eston Sambo
and C. O. Dudley, who established MMCT around 1994. Australian forester Jim Chapman’s
Mount Mulanje: A Plea for its Future (1990) was one source of inspiration. Aware of funding

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 lVIid-Term Review

opportunities emanating from the Rio Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 and
the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) created there, the Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity
Conservation Project (MMBCP) was prepared and submitted to the World Bank for GEF funding
to support initiatives aimed at reversing deforestation and loss of biodiversity and restoring the
ecosystem health of the Mulanje Mountain. Project funding of US$6.75 million was approved in
1999, became effective in 2001 and project implementation started in 2002. The project funding
from the World Bank/GEF ended in June 2008.

1.3. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The Project Appraisal Document (World Bank 2001), to which the Project Proposal makes
reference, states two development objective: (i) To maintain the vital watershed (headwater for
nine rivers) and (ii) to benefit local communities by establishing sustainable management of the
forest resources. It then states a ’ global environmental objective’:

The global environmental objective of the project is to preserve the globally significant
biodiversity and unique ecosystems of the Mulanje massijf at a level beyond what could be
expected based on the management objectives of watershed protection sustainable use of
forest products (World Bank 200] .' 4).

Apparently regarded as primary, this ‘global environmental objective’ has been developed into
operational objectives:

1. Maintain Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, including globally signiﬁcant biodiversity and vital
ecological services.

2. Increase awareness, understanding and appreciation of the value of the Mulanje Mountain
ecosystem, at local and national levels.

3. Improve sustainability of biological resource use and enhance the value of the Mulanje
Mountain ecosystem to local communities.

4. Establish long-term income stream and institutional capacity to ensure continuation of the
above objectives

5. Demonstrate the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as financing mechanism for
biodiversity conservation. 2

1.4. PROJECT COMPONENTS
The project had five major components: Trust administration, biodiversity conservation, research
and monitoring, environmental education, forest co-management and sustainable livelihoods, and

a conservation trust fund, or endowment fund (World Bank 2001: 8-11), elaborated as follows:

a. Trust Administration. With GEF funding this was established and became operational with an
Executive Director, programme ofﬁcers, accountant, secretary and support staff recruited as full-

 

2 The Project Appraisal Document (World Bank 2001) and the Project Proposal to Norway (MMCT 2007b)
presented four objectives, seeing the one concerning the trust fund as integral to the objective on income streams and
capacity building. The main text of the Agreement between the Governments and MMTC presented the trust fund as
a ﬁfth objective, as did the TOR for the MTR, and we chose to follow that.

time employees of MMCT. During an inception phase the activities and modalities under each
component were developed. Capacity and skills development involving MMCT and partners
were undertaken.

b. Biodiversity Conservation, Research and Monitoring. To promote the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity of Mulanje Mountain for the beneﬁt of all stakeholders, activities
proposed included biodiversity baseline survey and monitoring, capacity building, direct
conservation activities and research.

c. Environmental education. This component was included to raise awareness of the value and
importance of the MMFR within the Forestry Department and the surrounding communities.

d. Forest Co-management and Sustainable Livelihoods: There are two core activities, forest co-
management and livelihoods interventions. Consistent with the 1996 government policy, the
forest co-management component aims at increasing the communities’ share of the beneﬁts from
the MMFR. Livelihood interventions were implemented to enhance economic opportunities and
beneﬁts of the local communities thereby reducing pressures on the natural resources of the
Mulanje Mountain.

e. The Conservation Trust Fund The project provided a capital endowment of US$ 5.5 million
with the intention that it could provide a sustainable income stream of US$300 000 to 350 000
after programme support was over (World Bank 2001: 35).

1.5. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

Agreements were signed in 2001 between the MMCT and the World Bank and between MMCT
and the Malawian Government. The MMCT Board, representing the government and civil
society, provides oversight and policy guidance. The Executive Director and technical
programme ofﬁcers are responsible for implementing the project. MMCT also relies heavily on
its partners, particularly the District Forestry Ofﬁce (DFO), to implement activities. To facilitate
implementation, memoranda of understanding were signed between, respectively, MMCT and
Forestry Department headquarters and MMCT and Mulanje DFO. Projects were also
implemented with other departments, such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security,
Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development, and Fisheries Department (aquaculture projects).
Through collaborative agreements MMCT deﬁned the criteria and disbursing funds and methods
of implementation and supervision. During 2001 to 2008 the World Bank actively supervised
project implementation, particularly through regular review missions.

1.6. FUNDING SOURCES AND MODALITIES

Based on the view that long term availability of funds is central to sustainable conservation, the
GEF provided a $6.75million grant to MMCT of which $5.5 million was used to capitalize an
endowment. Proceeds from this endowment were expected to ﬁnance conservation activities into
the future. For the preparatory phase, GEF provided US$300 000 and an equivalent amount was
obtained from other donors, and it included the establishment of the Trust Administration,
initiating project activities and technical support by the University of Malawi, National
Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Malawi, and the Wildlife Society of Malawi.

Prior to the phasing out of GEF funding, MMCT submitted a proposal to the Norwegian Embassy
to support the continuation of project activities (MMCT 2007b). Since these matched some of the
priority areas of Norwegian development support, the Norwegian Government considered the

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 ll/Iid—Term Review

proposal favourably. There was thus no gap in the project activities in the transition from GEF to
Norwegian funding.3 An agreement was signed in 2007 between Norwegian Government, the
Malawi Government and MMCT through which Norway committed NOK25.5million to support
the implementation of project activities over a ﬁve-year period from 2007/2008 to 2011/2012
(MFA, GOM, and MMCT 2007). The contribution corresponds to about US$4.25 million or
MK6375 million (see Table 1), or an estimated 50% of the total MMCT budget for the period
from 2007 to 2012. The funding arrangement would enable MMCT to reinvest the annual income
from the endowment, which was expected to grow to a level where, from then on, it could fund
an MMCT annual budget of US$450 000 for project activities and administration.

1.7. NEW STRATEGY AND CHANGING GOAL STRUCTURE

MlVICT has prepared a Strategic Plan 2008-2012 (MMCT 2008b), according to which:
MMCT’s vision is

T o contribute towards a Mulanje Mountain Global Biosphere reserve that is responsibly
managed and equitably benefiting all.

MlVICT’s mission is: WC T is a collaborative partnership that provides an enabling
environment for the improved management, wise use and understanding of Mount Mulanje
and its resources in a transparent, professional, committed and sustainably financed manner.

The Strategic Plan introduces a new goals structure, which is the basis for most reporting later on,
including the monitoring matrix provided to the MTR Team (see Appendix 4). The eight
‘strategic areas’ identiﬁed are: 1) Biodiversity conservation, 2) Law enforcement, 3) Sustainable
livelihoods, 4) Sector resource management (related to energy, tourism and water), 5) Plantation
management, 6) Forest co-management, 7) Environmental education and communication, and 8)
Research.

 

3 The project proposal was dated August 2007 and the agreement signed November 2007. According to the
Executive Director there was a prior understanding that funding would be granted. According to the Programme
Ofﬁcer at the Embassy, no formal appraisal of the document was carried out as it was assumed that structures etc.
were in place reﬂecting the established nature of the project.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review
1.8. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE MID-TERM REVIEW

The purpose of the Mid-Term Review is to provide an assessment of the project in relation to the
project goal, objectives and expected outputs. It is both retrospective and prospective, i.e. taking
stock of the past achievements to date (2008-2010) and looking into the future with respect to
achieving the project objectives and targets (2010-2012). More speciﬁcally, the review assesses
progress by focusing on among others:

- The performance and effectiveness of MMCT in the implementation of biodiversity
conservation activities as mandated by the objectives of the MMBCP

- Mechanisms for the sustainable ﬁnancing of MMFR management

- Linkages and cooperation with partners; public and private

- Constraints faced and measures taken to address them

- Possibilities and limitations in integrating with national programmes such as ASWAp and
NAPA

- Changes that may be required in both design and implementation for MMBCP to better attain
its development objectives (full TOR in Appendix 1).

1.9. METHODS USED FOR THE REVIEW

The Mid-term Review was conducted by Dr Poul Wisborg (Team Leader) from the Department
of International Environment and Development Studies, Norargic, at the Norwegian University
of Life Sciences (UTVIB) and Dr Charles B. L. Jumbe, independent consultant on leave from the
Centre for Agricultural Research and Development (CARD), University of Malawi (the MTR
Team or the Team).

The Team collected and reviewed literature related to the study, including Malawian policy
documents, project document and reports. A series of interviews and focus-group discussions
were held from 13 to 22 September 2010, including MMCT staff, MlVICT Board members,
implementation partners and communities provided the information knowledge on which the
review is based (see Appendix 2 for itinerary and list of individuals consulted). The MTR Team
visited sites of MMCT programmes. The Team spent two days and nights on Mount Mulanje,
where it observed progress in the removal of invasive species, visited cedar nurseries at Chambe
and Lichenya, observed the survival of planted cedar, forest and grassland ecology and the effect
of uncontrolled/controlled ﬁre. The Team met forest workers and other users of the mountain
including women forest committee members. The team later visited Ndala Village to learn about
livelihoods interventions including irrigation and agriculture, ﬁsh farming, community nursery
and woodlot. Finally, the team visited two villages with forest co-management agreements.

A number of limitations affected the review mission. Time and resources did not allow for
detailed or in-depth data collection, review of the historical context nor research outputs from the
project. The team visited only few sites with MMCT interventions and none under the
Environmental Education programme, although it noted posters and signs with environmental
messages during the ﬁeld trips. Within a short time, the team had to synthesize the data collected
and to prepare its presentation to the MMCT Board meeting on 23 September 2010 as part of the
process to validate the ﬁndings. The review team also presented key ﬁndings to the Norwegian
Embassy on 24 September 2010. We hope and trust that despite these limitations, the report

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

provides constructive insights into the progress achieved and areas that need to be strengthened to
reach project goals.

1.10. ORGANISATION OF THE REPORT

The rest of the report has been organised as follows: Chapters 2 through 6 address the ﬁve major
objectives as presented in the Agreement concerning the Norwegian funding. Chapter 7 gives an
overall assessment of the policy relevance of the project. Chapter 8 outlines what the Review
Team sees as major challenges. The main conclusions and recommendations are presented in
Chapter 9. The report contains a list of references as well as appendices.

2. MAINTAIN MULANJE MOUNTAIN ECOSYSTEM INCLUDING GLOBALLY
SIGNIFICANT BIODIVERSITY AND VITAL ECOLOGICAL SERVICES

The diverse ecosystems of Mulanje Mountain play important roles for natural resource based
livelihoods, for the hydrology of the region, and for the conservation of biodiversity local,
national and global significance. This chapter addresses the component ‘Biodiversity
conservation, research and environmental monitoring’, a component that has widely been seen as
the most central one of the MMBCP.

2.1. THE ISLAND IN THE SKY - BACKGROUND

Mulanje Mountain is called ‘the island in the sky’ and ‘the rock that does not move’ in local
folklore. It stands out as an imposing feature of the Mulanje and Phalombe districts, with forested
slopes, sheer rock faces and narrow gorges rising up to 3 000 metres above sea level and
towering above the surrounding plan at around 500 to 700 metres. It is the highest mountain
feature between the Kilimanjaro complex in Tanzania and the Drakensberg in South Africa
(MMCT 2007b) and the area of the mountain is about 650km2 and one of the world’s largest
granite inselbergs (Beard 1997). ‘The island in the sky’ may refer to this vision of the mountain,
to the water that comes from it, or to the fact that the mountain is rather inaccessible.

Scientifically too, the mountain is said to belong to the so called Afromontane archipelago
stretching from the Red Sea to the Cape (Clare 1999). Clare quotes Jim Chapman’s (1990) view
that, ‘what makes Mulanje so fascinating is its island ecology which has led to the evolution of
endemic ﬂora and fauna’.

The region has a moderate, tropical highland climate with a single summer rainy season from
November to April. Average maximum temperatures within the ecoregion are 24 0C in summer
and 12 0C in winter. In winter temperatures may drop below zero at high altitude (World Wildlife
Fund 2008). Rainfall is high, 2 000mm to 3 000mm per year according to Beard (1997), and
varies strongly depending on direction, altitude and aspect. Mulanje Mountain is the source of
nine significant rivers.

Five indigenous vegetation types are described for Mulanje: (1) miombo woodland, (2) lowland
forest, (3) Afromontane/Widdringtonia (endemic Malawi cedar) forest, (4) plateau grassland and
(5) the high-altitude vegetation of the peaks (World Wildlife Fund 2008). The tea estates
surrounding the mountain were once covered by lowland rainforest of which small pockets
remain on Mulanje Mountain (ibid). Timber and fuel wood plantations were estimated to cover
8% of the Forest Reserve (World Bank 2001).

The Mulanje Mountain is of high interest for biodiversity conservation. Species richness, the total
number of species present, is high. For example, MMCT (2008a) refers to the presence of 1 300
plant species, 250 butterﬂies, 180 bird species, 55 reptiles and 32 amphibians. The rate of species
endemism (those found nowhere else) is fairly high. MMCT (2008a) reports 40 endemic plant
species, 8 endemic butterflies and 6 near-endemic birds. The rate of endemism concerning
reptiles and amphibians is also significant (MMCT 2008a, World Wildlife Fund 2008). Once
Mulanje Mountain was home to herds of large mammals, such as eland, but the only antelopes to

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

remain are bushbuck, red duiker, blue duiker and klipspringer, which can hide in vegetation or on
steep slopes. Rock hyraxes are common on rocky slopes, with two rare subspecies.

The Afromontane/Widdringtonia forests are found in gorges and ravines above 1 600m. There
are two species of Mulanje cedar (local name: nkungusa). The ﬁrst is Widdringtonia whytei,4 a
tall-standing tree that grows in ﬁre-protected valleys with thick soils and can grow for hundreds
of years. It is endemic to Mulanje Mountain and has been declared Malawi’s National Tree.
Remaining fragmented stands of Mulanje cedar were estimated to cover from 1 000ha (World
Bank 2001: 3) to 1500ha (15km2) (World Wildlife Fund 2008). The second species, not
endemic, is Widdringtonia nodiﬂora, a shrub growing in areas with shallow soils and on the
edges of the forest, it can survive ﬁres by re-sprouting (World Wildlife Fund 2008).

The signiﬁcance of the Mulanje Mountain has been recognised through various designations:

- Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve (declared 1927 by the then colonial government)

- Mulanje Mountain Global Biosphere Reserve (MMGBC) (declared 1990 by UNESCO)

- Recognised by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as one of 200 ecoregions of particular
importance for biodiversity conservation and an Afromontane Regional Centre of Endemism

- Recognised by IUCN as an International Centre of Plant Diversity

- Recognised by Conservation International as an Eastern Afro-Montane Biodiversity Hotspot

- World Heritage Site (application prepared by MMCT and a consultant)

The classiﬁcations may be used to justify various approaches to conservation. For example,
‘Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve’ underlines Forestry Department authority and management
objectives, while MMCT emphasises a wider public interest with its vision of contributing
towards ‘a Mulanje Mountain Global Biosphere Reserve that is responsibly managed and
equitably beneﬁting all’. The different designations also create ambiguity about which
geographical area documents refer to. For example, the Global Man and Biosphere Reserve is
larger than the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve. The Project Proposal to Norway (MMCT
2007b) refers to the Forest Reserve while the MMCT Strategic Plan 2008-2012 straddles between
Forest Reserve and Mulanje Mountain Global Biosphere Reserve. More attention is needed to
meaning and speciﬁc importance of these areas for management.

2.2. OBJECTIVES

The MMBCP is concerned with the ‘global environmental objective’ of maintaining biodiversity
(see section 0) whereas the mentioned ‘development objectives’ (to maintain the vital watershed,
and to beneﬁt local communities through forest management) are secondary. It is explained that
GEF funds will speciﬁcally support biodiversity conservation, monitoring species and indicators,
identify priority biodiversity conservation sites and measures ‘including co-management of forest
resources’.

In the Strategic Plan 2008-2012 (MMCT 2008b) and the corresponding monitoring matrix
(Appendix 4), what used to be project component 1 is addressed under strategic objectives 1
(‘Improve the state of the ecosystems and biodiversity on Mount Mulanje’), 2 (‘Reduce the

illegal harvest and use of the mountain’s resources’) and 8 (‘To generate relevant research and
information to inform programme direction and priorities.’).

2.3. ‘THREATS’ AND CAUSAL UNDERSTANDING

The MMBCP aims to reverse what it calls a ‘trend of degradation and loss of globally signiﬁcant
biodiversity’. More particularly, the project document (World Bank 2001: 2) argues that there are
four ‘threats’ to the Mulanje mountain, a problem identiﬁcation has remained central to the
MMBCP to date:

‘Unsustainable resource use’ (seen as being caused by population pressure, poverty, lack of
awareness and lack of incentives for conservation),

- ‘Agricultural encroachment’, use of land in the reserve for agricultural purposes,

- ‘Damaging bush ﬁres’ (due, it is said, to inadequate ﬁrebreaks and lack of capacity),

- ‘Invasion of alien species ’ which are said to crowd out indigenous species.

The causal analysis expressed in project documents has several elements:

- Population (growth) is a core element.5

- Lack of resources. Households access an average of 0.4ha of cultivable land and the area is
food deﬁcient. People access the forest for ﬁre wood (for sale and use), thatch grass,
medicines, honey, wild fruits, and hunting. All uses are indiscriminately described as
problematic: ‘All of this resource use is becoming increasingly unsustainable and having
negative ecological impacts as the population grows.’ (World Bank 2001: 2).

- Fire is explained as main-made, frequently caused by hunters clearing the bush.

- The reduction of Mulanje cedar is explained as the result of ﬁre inhibiting regeneration and an
aphid (sap sucking insects) introduced in 1985 which killed 10 000 trees and abuse of permits
to fell dead-standing trees (felling of live Mulanje cedar has been banned since 1993).

The problem identiﬁcation that informs the MMBCP typically mixes together undesired features
and the causal explanation of these features. The analysis of phenomena, causal mechanisms,
institutional factors and driving factors is rudimentary but one may see the causal analysis as
having four levels. First, underlying drivers are seen to be population (growth) and poverty.
Second, institutional factors, particularly participation and economic beneﬁts (incentives),
mediate the relationship between the drivers (poverty, population) and the third level, human
practices (such as use, conservation, destruction), and fourth, ecological causal relations (such as
the effect of ﬁre or an invasive alien). It is a challenge to maintain a sophisticated and adaptive
learning approach to such multilevel causal relations. One may argue that underlying factors
(drivers) need attention in a sustainable development perspective but they will also be (a)
contested and (b) difﬁcult to address. For example, population growth may be seen as a driver,
while it may also be attributed to socio-economic conditions and institutional factors.

 

5 According to the World Bank (2001: 2) Mulanje and Phalombe cover an area of 4 460km2, have a population of
825 000 in 85 ’villages’, thus 9 700 per village, and a population density of 185/km2

2.4. PROPOSED MEASURES

The proposed measures are: (i) raising awareness about the value of biodiversity; (ii) support the
implementation of the forest management plan to ensure conservation; (iii) strengthening the
capacity of FD and communities; and (iv) encourage participation by communities by increasing
the benefits through employment and forest co-management (our emphasis). Taken together;
these provide a strategy for addressing the threats to the conservation values of the mountain.
While one may suspect that they are not ‘deep’ enough; given the existence of an institutionalised
economy of crime in a context of deep resource poverty; each can be operationalised. It is a
challenge to maintain the balance between them: for example; avoid awareness without capacity
and beneﬁts; as well as the opposite.

The Project Proposal (MMCT 2007b: 5-6) presents ten ‘management interventions’; out of which
ﬁve relate to this component: Eradication of invasive alien plants; Fire prevention; Mountain
infrastructure; Law enforcement; and Reforestation. (We rearranged the order in the following).

2.5. OUTPUTS, OUTCOMES, IMPACT AND INDICATORS

The ‘outputs’ that are mainly related to this project component are:6

- Reversal of the trend of degradation and loss of globally significant biodiversity in the
Mulanje Mountain ecosystem; determined through [an] ecological/biodiversity monitoring
program;

- Contributions to the implementation of the Reserve Management Plan; focusing on the
biodiversity conservation aspect;

- A decrease in the incidence and levels of the activities and events which represent important
threats to the area’s biodiversity;

- Implementation of specific conservation actions (e.g.; firebreak maintenance; removal of
invasive exotic vegetation); carried out to the extent possible by local communities (World
Bank 2001; MFA; GOM; and MMCT 2007: 9—10).

The Project Design Summary (MMCT 2007b) also gives more specific information on outputs

and indicators Table 2.

 

6 The Team observes that the list mixes activities, inputs, outcomes and impact.

The MTR Team notes that the ﬁrst ‘outcome impact indicators’ (right column), that a plan is
being implemented, merely repeats the output, the second, that the ecosystem is in ‘good
condition’, addresses an impact but is crude. The MTR Team also notes that the Project
Proposal’s monitoring matrix (see Appendix 3) does not address the major interventions in
biodiversity conservation (such as ﬁghting invasive species), although these are described in the
main text of the proposal. The design has been improved in the clearer structure of activity areas
in the Strategic Plan 2008-2012 and the corresponding monitoring matrix (Appendix 4), where
major interventions are accompanied by quantitative targets and indicators.

2.6. FIRE PREVENTION

Most ﬁres on the Mulanje Mountain are said to be caused by humans. Reasons for starting a ﬁre
include: hunters clearing bush to chase or see game, honey collectors using smoke to chase bees,
illegal loggers clearing bush so that they may more quickly detect guards approaching, ﬁres made
for cooking or heating, and ﬁres made as a form of protest. Fire prevention efforts can address (i)
the human behaviour leading to ﬁres and (ii) rapid detection of ﬁres and other measures to limit
the spread and impact of ﬁre.

Fire prevention efforts include information to communities as well as training and equipping ﬁre
guards. Prior to the project the Forestry Department maintained ﬁre stand-by crews, seen as a
reason for a low number of ﬁres in 2001 and 2002. A major activity of MMCT has been
constructing and/or maintaining a network of ﬁrebreaks to prevent the spread of ﬁre across the
mountain (Figure 1).

Maintenance of ﬁrebreaks started in 2002. The work was done by Forestry Department and
members of surrounding communities, focusing on plateau areas (MMCT 2008a). Annual ﬁre
break maintenance varied between 896km in 2002-3 and 212km in 2006-7; during the six years
2002-3 to 2007-8 a total of 3 500km (includes repeated clearing of some stretches) was covered,
an average of 583km per year (MMCT 2008a: Table 1). The activity was below average in
2005-6 (314km) and 2006-7 (2l2km) due to lack of funding. Increased effort in 2007-8 (880km)
was in part due to the availability of Norwegian funding. During the tour of the mountain, the
Review Team observed the network of new or cleared ﬁrebreaks (for example, Figure 1).

In 2008—9 a consultant determined the total network of ﬁrebreaks above 2 000m.a.s.l. to be
500km and produced a set of maps now used in planning and implementation (MMCT 2009c: 2).
It was proposed that 45 km of new ﬁrebreaks should be constructed.

Achievements (output) in 2008-2009.‘ Firebreak maintenance covered 814km in 2008—9 (MMCT
2009c: 2)7 employing about 250 members from surrounding communities. Construction of new
ﬁrebreaks was not mentioned by the report.

Achievements (output) in 2009-2010.‘ Progress was good with maintenance of 751km of ﬁre
breaks using about 300 labourers. Construction of new ﬁre breaks was not mentioned by the
report.

Achievement (impact): The impact of the ﬁre prevention effort has always been difﬁcult to
ascertain. Impact is monitored in terms of (i) the number of ﬁres per year and (ii) the area
damaged.

Number of ﬁres. This is strongly affected by the weather, which is one of the major reasons that it
is difﬁcult to discern any trend or impact of the MMCT efforts (discussion with MMCT in the
ﬁeld and MMCT Annual Report 2009-2010). MMCT has received MODIS satellite observation
from NASA/University of Maryland. Reported numbers were: 2001 (23), 2002 (7), 2003 (90),
2004 (30), 2005 (93), 2006 (44), 2007 (no observation). The MMCT Annual Report 2009-2010
does not provide a clear assessment of impact. A number of ﬁres were described. It is estimated
that ‘we had a relatively lesser ﬁre intense season in 2009’ (MMCT 2010b: 6), but the basis for

 

7 However, the draft report for 2009-2010 gives a lower figure of about 400km for 2008-9 (Fig. 1.1., page 5).

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

the assessment is not clear, since it was noted that the MODIS ﬁre alert system failed again in
2009.

During the tour of the mountain, the MTR Team could observe the result of a ‘controlled’
burning that got out of control due to high speed winds (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). We
made cursory observations of a number of minor ﬁres that posed a threat of spreading across the
mountain despite the ﬁrebreaks.

Area damaged. MMCT’s reporting matrix monitors impact in terms of the area damaged by wild
ﬁres (Table 3). The target is (as we understand) that the areas should be less than 10% of the total
area above 2 000m every year in the project period. It is claimed that the area was 6% in 2008-9
and of 8% in 2009-10, within target. However, an elaboration and conﬁrmation of these ﬁgures
would have been helpful. The ﬁgures on area damaged are considerably lower than those MMCT
(2007b) reported for earlier years when applying for funding (2002-3 and 2003-4 (20%), 2004-5
(10%), 2005-6 (50%) and 2006-7 (10%). This suggests a positive trend.

What matters most is the long-term trend, which requires a closer analysis of longitudinal date
than the Team has been able to conduct. A concern is the possible impact of climate change,
which should be monitored. The amount of and distribution of rainfall (particularly the length of
droughts) and wind patterns could be elements of a worsening scenario due to climate change.

Recommendations: The Review Team is of the view that since some ﬁres are caused by
individuals who come from surrounding villages, MMCT together with the Forestry Department
should continue to devote effort in its campaigns and civic education of the local communities on
the importance of preventing wild ﬁres. MMCT together with key partners such as the Police,
Forestry Department and the District Councils must engage communities in forest protection.
There is need for better understanding and documentation of causes and trends.

2.7. ERADICATION 0F INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS

Article 8h of the Convention on Biological Diversity calls upon member states to take
appropriate measures to prevent the introduction of and to control or eradicate alien species
threaten ecosystems, habitats or other species. One of the key management actions under the
MlVIBCP has been to eradicate invasive alien plants that are displacing indigenous vegetation.
According to MMCT (2006), there are over twenty known invasive alien plant species in and
around the MlVIFR. These include Pinus patula (Mexican pine), Rubus ellipticus (Himalayan
raspberry), Pteridium aquillinum (Bracken fern), and Eucalyptus spp. (or blue gum) (see also
Table 4).

are highlighted The degree of threat to biodiversity and level of diﬁﬂicully of eradicating the species is denoted with
one to ﬁve asterisks.

Over the years, MMCT and District Forestry Ofﬁcers involving the surrounding communities
have cleared some of these alien species. The major emphasis has been on Mexican pine and
Himalayan raspberry. A major remaining challenge, according to MlVICT, is the Bracken fern
(Pteridium aquillinum) which suppresses indigenous vegetation and accumulates considerable
amounts of dry matter to become a ﬁre risk (MMCT 2008a, 2010b).

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 4 A/Iid—Term Review

Mexican pine was planted on Mulanje Mountain for timber production but has also spread on its
own (rogue stands). It is seen as a harmful competitor with indigenous vegetation. MMCT
therefore initiated an eradication programme. By mid 2005 all the pine at Sombani (74 hectares)
had had been removed and about half of the 800 hectare plantation on Chambe plateau (MMCT
2007b). MMCT saw a need to renew the effort, remove isolated stands, and to control the re-
growth of young pine. The target was that only 200 hectares of the original 950 would be left by
the end of the 2008-9 reporting period and that 90% of the rogue pines would have been
eliminated (MMCT 2007b: Appendix 4, Performance Monitoring System). By June 2008 the
status was as indicated in Table 5.

Source: A/LMCT (2008a: Table 2, no page). Reference is to Pinuspatula and Rubus ellipticus

2008-2009. The achievement was 137ha of pine (68% of the target of 200 stated in the Project
Proposal 2007) and l57hectares of pine and Himalayan raspberry combined (MlVICT 2009c: 3).
This is 52% of 300ha, which seems to be the combined target used in the monitoring matrix
(Table 7 and appendix 4). The main problem indicated was delayed recruitment of labour.

2009-2010. The draft 2009-2010 Annual Report states that 110ha of pine was cleared on Chambe
and 8 ha at Namasire (ll8ha against a target of 150 ha, or 79% achievement) and 8ha of
Himalayan raspberry against a target of 20 (40%).8 A consultancy commissioned on the
eradication of Bracken fern recommended a combination of mechanical and chemical methods.

The Annual Reports do not refer to the targets in the Project Proposal. However, using the above
ﬁgures, a total area of 851 hectares of pine has been cleared, bringing down the original stand of
950ha to 99ha (reduced by 90%). Whether 90% of rogue trees have been removed (the target for
2008-2009 in the Project Proposal) is more questionable.

 

8 Again, the target stated in the Annual Report (150ha + 20ha) does not tally with the monitoring matrix, which has a
target of 300ha (combined) and an achievement of 108ha, or 54% of target (Table 7 and Appendix 4).

Observation 1: Large patches of pine re-growth were observed during the ﬁeld tour (Figure 5
and Figure 6), which indicates that even more vigorous re-growth should be expected when the
rainy season starts. Further removal of re-growth appears to be highly labour demanding. The
Review Team is of the opinion that a gradual, experimental approach in removing the pines could
have been considered instead of wholesale clearing. Once an area is cleared, one could observe if
there is re-growth of native species or take action to re-plant Mulanje cedar on experimental
basis.

Observation 2: The review team observed that the cleared pine had generally been left on the
plateau, and that men from surrounding communities were cutting it into planks and carrying
them to their villages below (Figure 7).

While ecological concerns were the major motivation for the clearing of the pines, a lingering
question is: Could the felled pines have been utilised as timber or ﬁrewood as a beneﬁt to local
communities? The Review Team ﬁnds that leaving the felled pines to rot in the cleared areas is a
waste considering the high demand for ﬁrewood and timber. One could have expected that the
felled pines could have been sold to local communities as ﬁrewood or to make planks out of the
pines under regulation. This could have been a win-win approach from the ecological and welfare
perspectives. According to MMCT, the practice of utilising the pine for planks practice was not
‘encouraged’. Thus, utilisation was happening but could have been organised around a legitimate
beneﬁt of participation in conservation.

Recommendation: The Forestry Department and MMCT should design appropriate rules for
community use of the felled pines for ﬁrewood or timber.

2.8. REFORESTATION

Replanting indigenous tree species, particularly of Mulanje cedar, Widdringtonia whytei has been
pursued by MMCT and Forestry Department since 2002. The first nursery was constructed at
Chambe by 2003 and the second at Likhubula by 2004. By 2007-8 six forest nurseries had been
established (adding Sombani, Chinzama, Lichenya and Madzeka) (MMCT 2008a: Table 3). The
major planting of Mulanje cedar seedlings appears to have taken place in the early years: 11 000
in 2002-3, 16 000 in 2003-4 and 24 000 in 2004-5 (ibid.). In addition to Mulanje cedar, 1 000
seedlings of Prunus aﬁicana were planted on about 12 hectares.

Together with Earthwatch Institute MMCT has made efforts to monitor the impact of both natural
regeneration of Mulanje cedar and artificial (planting). A number of micro-environmental factors
affect natural regeneration and that ﬁre is the major threat to young trees (MMCT 2008a).
Monitoring of artiﬁcial regeneration (planting) showed that this is a fairly difficult venture. Three
monitored sites showed: At Sombani, all the planted seedlings had died in the second year, at
Lichenya of a sample of 50, only 11 (22%) had survived; at Chambe 29 (or 58%) had survived.
The report concluded: ‘Evidently, Mulanje cedar will not perform in open canopy areas such as
those cleared of Pinus patula’ (MMCT 2008a: Figure 3, and comments). The results over time
concerning Prunus aﬁicana was not reﬂected in the end-of project report (MIVICT 2008a).

2008-2009. The MMCT Annual Report 2008-9 is imprecise in reporting that ‘six nurseries were
opened’, since these were already reported as up and running in the 2007-8 reporting period.
About 69 000 seedlings were planted during the year, covering 52 ha, which was a twice as much
as planned and a much more than earlier years (MMCT 2009c: 3). More than half of this (34 000
seedlings and 25 hectares) was at Chambe. (A different figure of 40.3ha for 2008-9: Table 8).

2009-2010. Once again, the report is imprecise in stating that ‘six nurseries were opened ...etc’,
the formulation being copied verbatim from the previous year’s report (MMCT 2010b), and we
expect that it will be revised. Planting took place from December 2009 to February 2010. About
20 650 seedlings were planted covering 16.5 hectares at Chambe, Lichenya, Madzeka, Chinzama
and Mzimba. The achivement was 41% of target. The major problem was inadequate collection
of seeds (MMCT 2010b: 8, 15).

In total over the years (2002-2010), 114ha have been replanted with Mulanje cedar and 0.6ha
with other species. The current target is to have replanted 400 hectares with Mulanje cedar by
2013 (Table 8 and Appendix 4). The cumulative achievement by 2010 (taking the figures here at
face value) was 56.8ha, or 57% of the 100ha target by that time.

The Review Team visited the forest nurseries at Chambe and Lichenya and noted the continued
effort by MMCT and Forestry Research Institute of Malawi (FRIM) in raising seedlings of
Mulanje Cedar that are ready for transplanting. The Team were also shown examples of how
seedlings and young trees were performing, mainly in the area of the Chambe basin around the

19

 

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

Chambe Hut. From casual observation it was clear that the results were still mixed. Some young
trees had survived and appeared in good condition; others were damaged, and some killed,
apparently by frost (Figure 8). In one case a ﬁre break had later been constructed, leaving the
planted Mulanje cedar seeming more exposed. This could have been avoided with better
planning. The Team lacked solid information and discussion on the impact of the artiﬁcial
regeneration (planting) programme, for example in the annual reports. It also lacked discussion of
the use of other indigenous tree and bush species. The expertise available with FRIM, particularly
T. Chanyenga, is valuable in this connection and could be utilised more.

Rather than just looking at the success of the Mulanje cedar, it is important that a viable cover of
indigenous vegetation is re-established to evolve according to a natural ecological succession.
The diversity and dynamics of such a vegetation cover and succession should be given more
attention. The monitoring and analysis of the impact of replanting efforts be strengthened. The
programme should not become a ‘numbers game’ of seedlings planted and area covered, with
insufﬁcient attention to survival, ecological impact or beneﬁts for communities. The draft Annual
Report 2009-2010 stresses that the programme aims to promote sustainable utilisation as per the
Convention on Biological Diversity Article 10 MMCT 2010b) but this has received little
attention in the documents. The MTR Team also recommends that MMCT and the forestry ofﬁce
start preparing for the planting of Mulanje cedar in time before the rains start.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

2.9. IMPROVE MOUNTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE

One element is the improvement of accommodation on the mountain for the workers who carry
out panting, law enforcement etc. The proposal was to renovate and construct new
accommodation at appropriate points around the mountain.

According to stakeholders consulted, MMCT has been commended for improving the tourist huts
on the mountain, but so far, out of the three houses planned for construction for workers in
2009-2010, none had been constructed. The Review Team observed that the ‘make shift’
accommodation at Lichenya Mulanje cedar nursery needs to be reconstructed with semi-
permanent materials (Figure 9). Other, older constructions for forest workers are also in
deplorable condition (Figure 10).

Recommendation: MMCT together with the Forestry Department should make use of the planks
and sawn timber to construct temporary shelters for staff working on the mountain.

2.10. LAW ENFORCEMENT

2.10.1. Observations

The project document (World Bank 2001) attributed threats to biodiversity and unsustainable
resource to high population density and poverty which induces various illegal resource uses
including agricultural encroachment of the lower slopes. The MMBCP therefore involved a
number of activities to enhance law enforcement. The District Forestry Officers in both
Phalombe and Mulanje districts informed that there are more than 500 staff on the payroll of the
Forestry Department and some of these employed in law enforcement. The Police indicated that
although some villages had active community policing in place, the establishment of community
policing around the mountain has been hampered by lack of transport and funding for training.

Cases of agricultural encroachment and deliberate debarking of eucalyptus trees to expand crop
production are observed on part of the Mulanje Mountain. Some villagers reportedly express the
view that if parts of the reserve are mismanaged (such as plantations), the Forestry Department
loses its entitlement to exclude other users. The DFO Phalombe informed that their approach is to
negotiate with those who settle or cultivate in the reserve to move outside. In some cases the
district foresters plant pine in the areas where crops have been grown, to discourage the return of
the villagers who have used the land before. There were also reported cases of estates seeking to
extend their land into the MMFR. This may further de-legitimise efforts to manage cultivation in
the Reserve.

There are examples of increased control of illegal forest utilisation, perhaps particularly where
co-forest management underpins law enforcement efforts. Though the evidence is not conclusive,
some stakeholders believe that harvesting of Mulanje cedar and burning of charcoal has been
reduced in the Forest Reserve and that MMCT has contributed to this effect. A respondent stated:

Had it not been for WC T, the entire forests could have been depleted by now. In fact, the
Department of Forestry could not have managed to stop illegal harvesting of forest products
ﬁom the reserve. WC T sometimes came with the Police to chase illegal loggers up the
mountain (Resident, Mbewa village, Mulanje).

2.10.2. Case: Illegal possession of Mulanje cedar

Political inﬂuence can frustrate measures aimed at curbing illegal extraction of forest products or
extending their estates into the forest reserve. The MTR Team was informed of a case where a
high ranking politician abused his power to illegally obtain Mulanje cedar from the mountain and
protect himself from the consequences of the law. The case was confirmed by various ofﬁcials
and is documented in an MMCT internal report (MMCT 2009a). The case concerns the Thuchila
Estate, Phalombe, which is owned by the Mulli brothers. One of the Mulli brothers was at the
time Deputy Minister of the Interior and the family runs major business operation on contract for
the government and was a major funder of the ruling party’s 2009 election campaign.

On 24 May 2009 MMCT was informed that some 250 to 300 planks of Mulanje cedar were being
off-loaded at the Thuchila Estate, and that the timber was not marked and appeared to be too
fresh to be from the last felling of dead standing timber in 2007. The MMCT staff responsible for
law enforcement contracted the relevant DFO and the police, who went to the scene the following

22

 

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

morning. Having conﬁrmed that the timber was fresh and un-stamped and therefore illegally in
the possession of the estate owners, the forestry department staff supervised by the police
proceeded to off-load it from the estate truck and place it on the Forestry Department truck.
However, the estate owner at that time ordered his security staff to hinder the truck from leaving
the estate and subsequently to off-load it again. Apparently due to his high position in
government, the police resigned. In the words of a forestry ofﬁcial: ‘The police conﬁscated the
timber, but then Mr Mulli conﬁscated the police.’

The Regional Forestry Ofﬁcer (RFO) had been contacted and was advised by FD headquarters to
visit the scene, arriving the following day, Sunday 26 May. The parties again inspected the
timber to conﬁrm the illegality of possession. Forestry ofﬁcials were reluctant to follow MMCT
advice to proceed with a conﬁscation. The RFO proceeded to hold a meeting with the estate
owner, his lawyer and the alleged supplier of timber, which others were not allowed to attend.
The RFO stated that ‘we shall have a discussion separately to chart a way forward. Meanwhile,
do not use the planks.’ (MMCT 2009a). The outcome of the meeting was not clear.

The MMCT staff involved expressed frustration that MMCT was covering part of the costs of the
operation and yet, despite the clear violation of the law and despite rules being enforced against
others in possession of Mulanje cedar, ofﬁcials did otherwise in this case. To date, MMCT and
forestry ofﬁcials at district level were not aware of further ofﬁcial follow-up by the relevant
authorities.

2.10.3. Recommendations

The fact that the mountain is too big to be manned even by 500 forestry department staff calls for
a complementary approach of engaging local communities around the mountain in forest
protection. The Review Team proposes MMCT should give high priority to promote and
intensify livelihood activities in these densely populated areas on the foot of the mountain. The
Review Team observes that a militarised approach to managing the forest reserve and curbing
encroachment is not only costly, but also unsustainable (an issue we discuss further in section 0).
The MTR Team also ﬁnds the issue of illegal possession of ﬁrewood, and the lack of proper
ofﬁcial response, to be highly problematic. We also return to this issue, since the Thuchila Estate
is also involved in excluding communities from access to forest under co-management. These
cases therefore need to be understood, and addressed, in conjunction with one another.

2.11. RESEARCH AND ECOLOGICAL MONITORING9

The research component of the project has aimed at generating scientiﬁc knowledge about the
demographic, biotic and abiotic factors impacting on the ecosystem in order to design appropriate
biodiversity conservation and management strategies and actions. Research and ecological
monitoring is conducted in conjunction with the Department of Forestry (Forestry Research
Institute of Malawi, FRHVI) and other researchers.

The ecological monitoring sub-component aims at identifying and monitoring the status of
biodiversity and the health of its ecosystem in order to provide information to the Forestry
Department and other stakeholders to adequately address priority management action.
Biodiversity survey and monitoring and conservation/management-oriented research will be
carried out by FRHVI and other local organisations, with national or international technical
assistance as required. According to the MMCT Executive Director, further research on the
Mulanje cedar has been proposed to the UK Darwin Initiative through the partnership with Kew
Royal Botanical Gardens, FRIM UK Forestry, the University of Cape Town and MMCT.

Achievements: MMCT has successfully attracted international research institutions as National
Geographic Society, Cambridge University, Oxford University, and New York Botanical Society
amongst many others who have undertaken various research and monitoring activities on the
mountain. Therefore, much is now known regarding the diversity of plant species, types of birds
and snakes on the mountain. The Research Sub-committee of the MMCT Board has developed a
research plan, which is a valuable initiative (MMCT Research Committee 2009). It gives an
overview of what is regarded as important issues, and is a useful tool for initiating or soliciting
new projects.

Observation 1: Although the Department of Forestry through FRIM is responsible for issuing
permits to researchers to undertake biological or ecological research on and around the mountain,
the current Director of Forestry Department reported of past cases where foreign researchers
having carried out research without the knowledge of FRIM. IN such cases research information
would not be shared in the local scientiﬁc community. The MMCT Director informed that in his
view little or no independent research was going on and questioned whether this was a problem
today.

 

9 Research and biodiversity monitoring is not included in the description of activities in the project proposal 2007.

24

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

Observation 2: Although much of the research has concentrated on the ecological or biological
research, apart from the consultancy studies that aims at establishing benchmarks or baseline
indicators for measuring the impact of the various interventions by MMCT, little research has
been conducted on institutional aspect of forest management or the dynamics of the importance
of natural resources on rural livelihood over different periods or over many years.

Recommendation 1: It is important that all research remains transparent and the results shared.
Although tourists climbing the mountain are not allowed to collect any specimen from the
mountain, it is unclear if tour guides are strict enough to hinder that researchers, guised as
tourists, collect specimens. Such monitoring is made difficult due to geographic location of
FRHVI at Zomba. Thus, the DFO needs to link up with MMCT and Info Mulanje where tourists
climbing the mountain are screened.

Recommendation 2: As not much is yet known about the richness of the biodiversity of the
Mulanje Mountain, or institutional and socioeconomic aspects of the local communities surround
the mountain, there should be a formal institutional arrangement whereby students from the
University of Malawi, particularly Chancellor and Bunda Colleges, can undertake research in and
around Mulanje Mountain.

Recommendation 3: MMCT may consider expanding its national and international research
collaboration. One option may be joint research between Malawian and Norwegian students on
Mulanje Mountain issues. Bunda College has an established relationship with the Norwegian
University of Life Sciences (UMB) and has hosted students from Norway to carry out joint
research with Malawian students who were studying in Norway. This proved useful and had a
multiplier effect when research results were shared in both institutions and countries. MMCT
expressed the view that the Norwegian Embassy should consider supporting research
collaboration with Norwegian research institutions.

3. OBJECTIVE 2: INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AND
UNDERSTANDING

3.1. OBJECTIVE, OUTCOMES, OUTPUTS AND TARGETS

Objective 2 is to ‘Increase awareness, understanding and appreciation of the value of the Mulanje
Mountain ecosystem at local and national levels.’

The Project Proposal 2007 (Project Design Summary, see Appendix) suggests the following
‘outcomes/impact’ indicators: (i) Community knowledge and appreciation increased re target
messages; (ii) Decrease in FD/Community conﬂict relating to Reserve access and use; and (iii)
Allocation of funds for Reserve management.

The suggested ‘output indicators’ are that (i) key messages and educational and communication
approaches have been identiﬁed; (ii) agreements with implementation partners have been
established; and that requests are made for information from MMCT. The targets set for the years
2007-8 and for 2008-9 are that nine communication outputs per year and 50, respectively 60,
community events. The ‘real’ communication outputs required are higher, since for example four
newsletters give a score of l, as do two brochures or two posters (as elaborated in the Proposal).
In the Strategic Plan 2008—2012, followed in later reporting, Objective 7 is: ‘To increase people’s
understanding of MMFR’O, participate in management activities and promote MMFR locally and
internationally’. Indicators are a score for community understanding (apparently survey-based)
and the number of community events held. As on other issues, the Strategic Plan is inept in
explaining what this means in practice.

3.2. ACTIVITIES
As documented by recent annual reports MMCT and partners have rolled out a diverse and
intense information and education campaign to promote objective 2 (or 7). (See types of events in

Table 9). Whatever perspective one takes, the creativity and range of activities is impressive.

3.3. OUTCOMES AND IMPACT

Positive things to note are that MMCT is highly visible in the area, and various actors recognise
that it has been creative and hard-working in promoting the recognition of Mount Mulanj e, both
as a tourist destination and as a biodiversity conservation area.

The cooperation with other organisations, such as the Wildlife Education Society of Malawi
(WESM) has played a valuable role in reaching 80 school clubs and 10 clubs for out-of-school
youth. WESM has the larger proportion of its funding from MMCT. MMCT supports activities,
transport and physical inputs, but not office space or time, so WESM efforts are based on
voluntary work. Another observation was that MMCT’s support focuses on ‘the forest’, to the
exclusion of other environmental issues such as waste management and pollution. Despite this,
Susan Pota, the Chairperson of WESM-Mulanje was appreciative of the support to WESM
environmental programmes for youths in Mulanj e, and had this to say:

WC T is the only organisation which invites a wide range of stakeholders, and they give their
reports, they send their newsletters, you see them in the markets and the streets and people
know something because of them. [...] Forestry Department, however are not visible in the
area. Many of those involved with the environment don’t know where the Forestry Department
is. If WC T had not been here, I don’t think I would have known that the Forestry
Department is here.

One manifestation of these efforts is that MMCT and its concern about the Mountain is widely
known in the communities bordering the mountain. On another level, the MTR team has
observed that touristic information and magazines in the recent year have given prominent
attention to Mulanje Mountain, particularly in the current year (2010).

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

The impact of education and communication activities is difficult to monitor and prove
quantitatively. The elaborate Annual Report 2008-2009 hardly discusses outcomes and impact.
The outcomes/impacts in the Project Proposal (2007) are not reported on, such as, reducing
conﬂict between forest users and the Forestry Department or raising incomes for conservation. It
is mentioned that children who go on mountain visits change their relationship to the mountain.
This is a valuable observation. In general for this kind of activity, qualitative description and
analysis can be valuable for documenting change but it would have to be cautious and critical and
to record nuances of human communication and change. While the narrative reporting is highly
event, product and output focused, the monitoring matrix (Appendix 4) focuses on a ‘survey
score’. The score was seven out of a target of ten in 2008-2009. We cannot assess the meaning
and importance of this indicator but the MTR Team believes that sociological studies could
contribute to capturing the impact of this component on behavioural change, for example.

In terms of presentation of the posters and sign posts, the Team observes a strong emphasis on
men as the main protectors of forests. Thus, the messages are not gender sensitive and may
appear not to reﬂect the reality on the ground, where women are the key actors as well as users of
forest products. For example, Figure 13 depicts a male chief speaking to women about
conservation of the forest, perhaps reinforcing a stereotype. Apart from the chief, there is only
one man in the group, yet we are told that most of the wild fires are caused by hunters who are
exclusively men. One would conclude that such messages target the wrong groups, which has
also been observed in some other posters.

3.4. A FEW CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS

The Team ﬁnds that the resource use and proliﬁc activity under this component may be too high,
or out of tune with the programme overall. Though our observations are cursory, we suggest for
consideration the following weaknesses and risks.

(i) The campaigns appear to be delinked from the more practical and materially important
efforts in conservation, livelihoods and co-management (however, a counter example
is that cooperation with the Mulanje Mountain Renewable Energy Agency (MUREA)
created a link between information and the practical promotion of energy conserving
stoves, as MuREA staff told us).

(ii) The activities involve no or limited beneﬁts and opportunities at community level and
may therefore lead to disappointments in the longer term or cynicism about environmental
messages.

(iii) The reporting shows little sensitivity about community differentiation, who the audience
is, who participates, and who, and how, they may utilise the knowledge gained. This is related to
an almost universal use of the concept of ‘community’ to indicate something homogeneous, often
an actor (in all programmes). The one exception to our generalisation is the attention to youth,
including youth that are unemployed and out of school, and clearly may have something to gain
from both training and a sense of participation. This is a very valuable aspect of the education
and communication activities. Gender awareness and sensitivity is lacking or not manifested.

(iv) We did not feel convinced that there was a genuine effort to learn from communities,
embrace or negotiate with their perceptions of the ‘values’ of the mountain, which are sometimes
stated with a taken-for-granted and unreﬂective certainty. Without such a critical listening and
learning approach, the programme may get the appearance of a veritable propaganda campaign.
However, it is inevitably not information or professing the ‘unique value’ of the mountain that
will save it, but rather the agency of individuals and groups based on the real opportunities they
have in using the mountain and on their ability to learn and take their insight into action. It is
therefore important to nurture people’s sense that they do have knowledge and that they play a
role in sustainable resource use. MMCT reports, on the contrary, tend to take for granted lack of
knowledge or lack of interest in the environment (MMCT 2009c: Background section , page 21).
If people are told that the ‘mountain is valuable’ but there is not genuine interest in both learning
about and supporting the ways it is valuable for people, the information will be patronising.

(v) Finally, we notice not a single example of where the communication activities are linked to
critical examination of issues or advocacy of people’s interests vis-a-vis, and perhaps against,
holders of power. Oxfam previously used human rights-based approaches in the area, with
considerable acclaim and resonance among community members (Kaunda et al. 2007). In the
Mulanje area, a rights-based media approach has been advocated by the Development
Broadcasting Unit (DBU), supporting community-based radio clubs in producing their own
programmes, exposing critical issues for communities and often challenging the authorities or
others responsible for service delivery (studied by Seeton 2008). Such an approach would be
equally relevant for MMCT issues.

4. OBJECTIVE 3: IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCE
USE

The full wording of the objective is: ‘Improve sustainability of biological resource use and
enhance the value of the Mulanje Mountain ecosystem to local communities’. It is addressed
through two sub-programmes, namely, forest co-management and sustainable livelihoods. These
were included in the project in order to strengthen rural livelihoods and reduce the need to engage
in unsustainable utilisation of natural resources on the Mountain.

4.1. FOREST CO-MANAGEMENT

4.1.1. Relevance

Forest co-management is a central programme in pursuit of the MMBCP objective of beneﬁting
communities. The intended output from the component is: ‘Improved FD and community
capacity to implement co-management policies in the MMFR through co-management pilot
projects.’(World Bank 2001: 31). It is the only programme that directly addresses the institutional
and economic dimensions of community involvement in natural resource management. The
concept has its basis in the participatory approaches promoted in the Forest Policy (Malawi
Government 1996) and the Forestry Act (Republic of Malawi 1997). The programme is of high
relevance from this policy point of view and because meeting human needs while maintaining or
enhancing forest resources is highly challenging, particularly in southern Malawi.

4.1.2. Background information and project history

The Forest Co-management and Sustainable Livelihoods component works with communities
living within five to seven kilometres of the Forest Reserve boundary. This is said to cover 130
villages, 19 400 households and a population of 106 000 in two districts of Phalombe and
Mulanje (MMCT 2009c: Forest Co-management Section, page 12). Many individuals and
households face land scarcity due to the presence of the Forest Reserve, the extensive tea estates
and high population density. Available farming land is estimated as below 0.4 ha per household.
The project started in 2004 and has generally been slow in taking off, perhaps due to (i) higher
priority given to biodiversity conservation and research and (ii) lack of support by the Forest
Department. By 2005, project siX co-management agreements had been prepared with
communities (at village headman level) and with assistance from FRIM. Agreements were
submitted to Forest Department headquarters in 2006. The Director of the time refused or did not
care to sign the agreements. By March 2008, the revised agreements were signed by the new
Director of the Forest Department. Due to poor participation by the Forest Department, MMCT
was only advised at a later stage that co-management agreements should, according to official
guidelines, be developed at group village level. The status at the end of the World Bank project
(June 2008) was that only siX agreements had been signed and another two had been prepared
(Sathawa in Mulanje and Nyambalo in Phalombe, both at group village level, covering five
villages each) (Table 10).

population (rounded to nearest 100), and area (rounded to nearest [0). Figures are from 2005 and 2008.

By 2008, the forest co-management activities had been extended to forest land covering 2 650
hectares with an estimated 5 650 households and 31 100 individuals in 16 villages from
Phalombe and Mulanje districts (Table 10). Eleven village agreements concerned miombo
woodlands, while ﬁve (in the Sathawa block in Mulanje district) concerned eucalyptus
plantations (MMCT 2008a: Section 4.2.1.2). The forest areas concerned are shown in Figure 14:
Legal co-management sites in Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve (MMCT 2008), a map presented
in MMCT’s end of project report (MMCT 2008a). These forest blocks were in the lower reaches
of the mountain, relatively accessible to communities, although in some cases users travel some
distance to reach the forest (about 4 km for the Chanasa community in Phalombe, for example).
MMCT reported Forestry Department reluctance to enter agreements concerning (higher altitude)
Mulanje cedar forest areas. MMCT also noted a conﬂict caused by Forestry Department granting
a private concession for timber harvesting in one of the blocks with eucalyptus.

The World Bank end of project report observed severe under-spending on the component. It had
spent only US$60 000, or 8%, of a budget of US$760 000 (World Bank 2008: Annex 1).
However, it had attracted funding partners to support complementary activities. The World Bank
rated the progress ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ due to delayed signing of the co-management
agreements (World Bank 2008).

4.1.3. Progress in the phase of Norwegian support

Norwegian funding was available from early 2008 and thus may have contributed to the
facilitation of the two group village agreements mentioned above. The Project Proposal to
Norway (MMCT 2007b: Appendix 4) set the targets (cumulative, we assume) given in Table 11.
The Table also gives later revisions of targets and reported achievements. A key target was to
reach 20 agreements covering 7 000 hectares by 2008-2009.11 A performance indicator was that
community NRM structures had been established and were functional.

The progress in achieving targets in the period of Norwegian support is:

- The WT C Annual Report covering July 2008- June 2009 refers to the two group agreements
in the Sathawa and Nyambalo communities, which were also reported as completed in the
World Bank funded programme ending June 2008. It states that agreements will soon be sent
to FD HQ for review and signing (MlVlCT 2009c: l4).

- Monitoring matrix 2010. The monitoring matrix (MlVlCT 2010c) provided to the MTR team
reports on forest co-management under Strategic Objective 612 (See Appendix 4).

o Signing of contracts. The cumulative13 target for signing of contracts/agreements by
2008—2009 has been revised down from 20 (Project Proposal) to 12 (status 8);14 for 2009—
2010 the new cumulative target is 15 (and status 8).

 

11 The proposal included a past period but not the full period of the proposal, which suggests recycling of earlier
plans. The narrative part (Appendix 2, page 3) also States that a priority was to employ a Forest Co-Management and
Livelihoods Programme Officer, which had apparently been accomplished.

involved in MMFR management and resource utilization activities’.

13 The matrix does not State when cumulative or annual targets are used. In this case, as we understand it, the
indicator Should not be titled ’New contracts Signed’ but “Contracts Signed (cumulative)’.

14 This is puzzling since the Annual Report for 2008—2009 reported that agreement number 7 and 8 were Still to be

sent for review and Signature by FD.

0 New activities started. The target is given as ten (10) for each year 2008—2009 to 2011—12
(an annual target, we assume). The achievement was 6 in 2008-2009 and 7 in 2009—2010.
This is fair, though it is difficult to assess the contents of ‘starting activities’.

- The WT C Annual Report covering July 2009- June 2010 (draft) (NM/[CT 2010b):

0 Area covered 02a): equivalent to the 2008 ﬁgure since no new agreements have been
entered (2 650 hectares) (This is not reported on in the monitoring matrix cited above).
This performance is particularly weak compared with the target in the Project Proposal to
Norway of covering 7 000 hectares by 2008—2009. The Annual Report states the target
was 9 559 hectares for 2009—2010. This means the achievement is 28% in the whole
period of the project and 0% in the period from July 2008 to present. Surprisingly the
target on area covered has not been revised down for 2010—201 1, although the target for
the number of agreements/contracts has been reduced.

0 Agreements/contracts: The Annual Report gives a different cumulative target for 2009—
2010 than the monitoring matrix (12 rather than 15), and has revised the target for 2010—
2011 down to 12.15 The status is represented as eight (8), but the narrative report hints that
the two 2008 agreements have yet to be signed.

0 Village institutions. The number of community structures established is reported as 131
against a target of 130 (cumulative), and the target for 2010—2011 is set at 135. This
presumably translates into an average of one functional institution in every village around
the mountain. The scoring of different factors (established, staff trained, equipped, active
for two years) appears sound and important to test that there is real content to the
indicator. Still, one would want more information on these institutions and how they
relate to MMCT programmes.

0 Four new sites have been identified for facilitation.

The (narrative) Annual Report 2009—2010 (draft) further gives an informative account of
progress and difficulties. For example, MMCT has signed an MOU with the Tea Research
Foundation about collaborative management of a mimosa forest of both ecological and
livelihoods significance.

4.1.4. Implementation and governance problems

The MTR Team observed positive achievements concerning the three agreements prepared in
Mulanje district in 2005. Residents here observed that they have, and enjoy, usufruct rights to the
co-management blocks for the collection of fire wood, thatch grass and other non-timber forest
products as well as the right to place beehives in the forest.16 They observed, as confirmed by
MMCT and FD, that illegal use of the forest has gone down and that communities were more
active in forest protection and development.

A number of problems have also been observed, to a large degree around cooperation with the

Forest Department.

(i) Efforts to develop co-management for Mulanje cedar clusters have not been realised due to
the higher level of conﬂict and FD scepticism (MMCT 2008).

(ii) The extension of the programme has been adversely affected by disagreement between
MMCT and FD at DFO level over allowances, which has meant that DFO Mulanje has not

 

15 The changing of targets over time and the discrepancies between different reports provided to the Team obviously
make it harder to represent and understand progress.
16 Meeting with villagers from Mangombo, Nakhonyo and Mbewa.

been willing to follow up agreements in Phalombe District. This situation hampered progress
in 2009.17

(iii) Residents in the Mulanje co-management villages claimed that some illegal forest utilisation
by outsiders was still occurring within their forest blocks, as they believed with the
connivance of forest department ofﬁcials.

(iv) The creation in August 2010 of a district-level (Mulanje and Phalombe) Local Forest
Management Board created tension. Some villagers had neither been aware that village
delegates were to elect Board members nor who they elected. Thus, this only became known
to them at the meeting with the MTR Team. Others were confused and disappointed because
they assumed that the Local Forest Management Board would replace the village level
agreements, which they regarded as a loss of valuable rights.

The MMCT Programme Ofﬁcer also mentioned an interesting problem concerning rights to the
forest. While the co-forest agreements were being developed with nearby communities, residents
from communities further apart came forward to argue that their family members had been
removed from the Mulanje Mountain at the time of creating the Forest Reserve, and were thus
legitimate right holders. This underpins an argument that careful study of historical and current
rights and practices is important to avoid conﬂict over forest co-management. Ideally, one would
be able to included mitigating measures for individuals and communities who have suffered due
to historical displacement but are currently living at such a great distance that it is difﬁcult for
them to be involved in co-management. (For example, they could be involved in livelihoods
development). Not only historical rights, but also current practices in using the forest, may lead to
conﬂict, if some communities are or feel excluded. This issue requires careful attention in any
further extension of the co-forest management programme.

4.1.5. Exclusion of forest users in Phalombe

From about 2008 a conﬂict has arisen between the politically inﬂuential Mulli brothers, who own
Thuchila Estate in Phalombe district, and local communities. The salient features of the case are
as given in the following based on interviews with several resource persons and ofﬁcials who, in
our view, have no beneﬁt from intentionally misrepresenting the case.

During 2006 MMCT in conjunction with FRIM developed co-forest management plans and
agreements with six communities in its project area, three of which were in Phalombe District.
The agreements were stalled in the Forest Department Headquarters but were eventually revised
and signed in March 2008. The agreements gave the participating communities certain rights of
access and extraction in a deﬁned block of the forest (to beekeeping, collection of dry ﬁrewood
and grasses) as well as extensive duties in forest protection. The agreement document signed by
Chanasa village, for example, is an impressive document reﬂecting the considerable professional
effort put into the preparations for the co-management arrangement18 (Chanasa Village,
Government of Malawi, and MMCT 2006). The document contains a Forest Management Plan,
agreed Chanasa Village By-Laws (in English and Chichewa) and the Constitution of the Village
Natural Resources Management Committee (VNRMC). The VNRMC comprises mainly women.

management, as illustrated by the photo of women and men that is reproduced on the front page
of the Co-Management Agreement.

In 2007, the inﬂuential Mulli brothers, among whom Mr Felton Mulli, Member of Parliament,
purchased the Thuchila Estate, which is situated between the communities concerned and the
three forest blocks covered by the co-management agreements. During the initial phase of their
presence in the Mulanje Mountain area, MMCT extended some cooperation and assistance to the
Estate to win the cooperation of the inﬂuential Member of Parliament. For example, MMCT
advised on the development of the cropping system, which contributed to avoiding a tobacco
estate that would have otherwise exerted pressures on forest for firewood for curing the tobacco.
MMCT also offered advice concerning the development of tourism activities on the land. 19

During 2008, the Mulli brothers approached the Forest Department Headquarters for an eco-
tourism concession on the same forest land as covered by the signed co-management agreements.
According to ofﬁcials at local level, this concession was granted hurriedly by the Director of the
Forest Department under duress and threats of severe consequences of non-cooperation. The
license was, according to several accounts, signed by the Director of Forestry. The review team
was further informed by officials that the signed concession was sent to the owners of the
Thuchila along with a request to prepare a management plan for the said land. During the drafting
process a meeting was held where MMCT, DFO Mulanje and a staff from FD Headquarters gave
inputs to the plan. They claimed that the signed licence along with the draft management plan had
contained no conditions in respect of community rights on the land. They had pointed this out in
several written comments on the draft plan. The officials, as confirmed by the DFO and MMCT
staff, have not since heard about the outcome of this process or the ﬁnal status of the plan.

Apparently, the owners of Thuchila Estate interpreted the tourism license as giving them
exclusive rights to use the area to which Chanasa, Makolera and Punduma gained rights through
their co-management agreement from 2008. Since 2009, the Team learnt that villagers have been
threatened with arms and hindered from accessing their land except in some cases against
payment of fees to collect firewood etc. Villagers are therefore neither able to exercise their
rights nor to carry out management and protection activities. This issue affects about 1 060
households or 5 800 individuals and some 630 hectares of forest.20

Villagers reported that the forest is in a deteriorating state due to illegal harvesting and increased
number of fires.21 Communities were, understandably, deeply angered by the development.
Villagers expressed their concerns and distrust of government, saying that they had been
‘betrayed’, since the terms of the co-management agreement had been ﬂouted. No physical
violence had occurred since the villagers backed down to avoid the consequences of violent
actions. The manager of the estate apparently claimed ownership to the land under the tourism
concession. One villager from Chanasa stated: ‘They told us that they bought the hill, so we are
not allowed to get in.’ Villagers have repeatedly reported their concerns to both the DFO offices

(Phalombe and Mulanje)22 and to MMCT but experienced that they were getting nowhere. One of
them said: ‘We fear Mulli, because he is the Government.’

As a conﬁrmation of the insistence on ownership, the owners of Thuchila Estate started selling
‘tickets’ to villagers to collect fire wood in their own co-management blocks. Several of the
villagers whom the MTR Team met had used this option for lack of alternatives. The Estate
applied a higher rate than those applicable in the co-management agreement, for example MKSO
as against MK20 for a head load of firewood. The Team was informed that new ‘tickets’ had
even been printed with MKlOO, so villagers feared an imminent price hike.

The Team learnt that at one point the Estate manager called the DFO Phalombe to offer to hand
over fees raised in this way. The DFO of Phalombe expressed that it was difﬁcult to accept funds
raised by an agent with no authority to collect fees on behalf of government. He consulted his
superiors (the Regional Forestry Office) but was told to await directions from the Forestry
Department Headquarters, which he was still doing at the time of the review. This example is
illustrative of both the frustration at district level and how proper response gets stalled at higher
levels.

The Team learnt that a Forestry Department task force has been established to look into the
matter. The representative of the Department stated at the MMCT Board meeting on 23
September 2010 that the Task Force had recently met and was conducting its work. He also
stated that ‘a mistake has been made’ by the Forestry Department, notably in issuing a licence
without the prior preparation of a management plan.

Inability to resolve this conﬂict seriously compromises MMCT partners, particularly the Forestry
Department. If it remains unresolved is likely to undermine the co-forest management
programme elsewhere in the Mulanje Mountain area. Further attention to the issue is elaborated
in the chapter on challenges (section 0) and proposed recommendations.

4.2. LIVELIHOODS PROGRAMMES

MMCT included the sub-component of sustainable livelihoods as an integral part of biodiversity
conservation in order to increase the share of the benefits from the forest reserve accruing to local
communities and to ensure that this is on a sustainable basis.

Achievements: During a field visit the Review Team noted that implanted livelihoods
interventions are appreciated by the local communities. These include small scale irrigation,
aquaculture and bee-keeping. A man had this to say:

During the normal harvesting period, I was able to obtain 3] bags of maize. With small-scale
irrigation, I am expecting to get 10 extra bags which I will sell to raise money for my
household. This is great to me. (Farmerﬁom Ndala village)

Another farmer from Ndala village told the review team that he and others appreciate MMCT for
introducing bee-keeping in the area. During the meeting with this community, two people

zone, while DFO Phalombe is responsible for law enforcement in the same area.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

proudly indicated that they have constructed a house with iron sheets from the income from the
sale of honey from 125 hives. Through bee-keeping some have been able to send their children to
school and another to buy a motor cycle. According to an internal MTR report, about 1 246
households around MMFR are involved in bee-keeping with estimated returns of MKO.5 million
per year (FD, MMCT, and World Bank 2006).

Observation 1: The Review Team is of the opinion that this sub-component has the potential to
reach out to more rural communities and reduce their dependence of rural communities on
charcoal, timber and firewood from the forestry reserves. However, the ﬁnancial and human
resources allocated to this component were too small to make a signiﬁcant impact due to
restricted geographic coverage. MMCT should be commended for identifying other donors who
have provided resources for large-scale livelihood interventions (the USAID funded MOBI+LISE
project). It is recommended that MMCT conducts a livelihood zoning exercise to identify zone
specific interventions.

Observation 2: The MTR Team is of the opinion that an important aspect, ‘capacity building’
was not adequately addressed when designing the livelihood interventions. Farmers met tended to
look to MMCT to identify markets for their commodities, which reﬂects a sort of dependency
syndrome. For example, although bee-keeping farmers from Mbewa village boasted of making
money out of bee-keeping, they still looked to MMCT assistance with transport and markets for
their products. Furthermore, each member of the association they had formed only contributes
MKSO per year, which is fairly insignificant in relation to the income realized from selling their
honey.

Observation 3: The MTR Team is of the opinion that the various livelihood enterprises are de-
linked from forest management. The Team would have expected that those participating in
livelihood activities were also engaged in forest co-management, which was not the case Ndala,
although it was close to the forest (however, it was the case in Mbewa, where forest co-
management and beekeeping were mutually reinforcing).

Recommendations: The MTR Team believes that the communities involved in various
livelihood interventions should be capacitated so that they become less dependent on MMCT. As
such, it is proposed that during the remaining phase, MMCT should:

- Use the livelihood enterprises as an incentive for participation and cooperation in forest
management on the forest reserve where there are co-management agreements or village
forest areas. In other words, livelihood interventions will make sense where forest
interventions, such as management of community or village forests and reforestation of
degraded areas, are implemented.

- Diversify the interventions by including the establishment of fruit tree nurseries in schools
and surrounding communities and by introducing village savings and loans.

- Encourage farmers to form associations and the leaders of these associations to be trained in
leadership, group dynamics, conﬂict management, entrepreneurship and marketing

- As MMCT extends its coverage, newly formed groups should only be supported if they
demonstrate that they have the capacity to manage their businesses after a thorough training
and are aware of the markets for their products.

38

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

- Assist mature associations such as the Sapitwa Bee Keepers Associations (SABA) in
forming cooperatives to ensure full empowerment and independence.

The forestry co-management and livelihoods programmes provide economic beneﬁts to
individuals and communities. Expanding those is a decisive factor in the overall success of the
programme. The Comaco programme in Zambia, supported by Norway, provides examples of
how production support and community markets are used to create support for conservation (Bie,
Kuntashula, and Mughogho 2009). This requires that the interventions are scaled up and
intensiﬁed and that the monitoring of impact is improved.

5. OBJECTIVE 4: ESTABLISH LONG-TERM INCOME STREAM AND
CAPACITY

5.1. BACKGROUND

This chapter addresses Objective 4 concerning institutional capacity, recognition of MMCT, and
income streams. The original component number 1 ‘Trust Administration’ addressed ofﬁce,
stafﬁng, training and the development of MMCT guidelines and procedures (World Bank 2001:
12). It also placed great emphasis on capacity building in the Forestry Department, related to
revenue collection, monitoring, extension and co-management, and biodiversity programmes
(World Bank 2001: 17). The TOR for the MTR (page 3 and 5) ask about the performance with
regard to ‘linkages and cooperation with partners, public and private’, ‘management authority
capacity improvement’ in the Department of Forestry, and how planning and innovation
contribute to sustainable management of the Forest Reserve.

5.2. OBJECTIVE, OUTCOMES AND INDICATORS

The objective for the component is to ‘establish long-term income stream and institutional
capacity to ensure continuation of 1-3’ [the three development objectives]. Sustainability is thus
of prime importance here. The suggested Output and Outcome /Impact indicators are that (i)
MMCT institutional structure established and functional, (ii) that effective biodiversity
conservation programme are maintained over time in the face of changing circumstances, and
(iii) that local stakeholders are aware of and positive towards MMCT and its objectives. The
MTR ﬁnds that these outputs/indicators have not been fully updated to the new phase of the
programme. They had, in part, been achieved during the WB phase, as they should.

Though the Strategic Plan 2008-2012 makes some rather bland remarks on the issues raised here,
they are not addressed as ‘Strategic Objectives’ in the monitoring matrix provided to the Team
(Appendix 4 to this report). We also mention that the Project Proposal (MMCT 2007b: Appendix
4) uses performance indicators such as the number of staff trained (125 in 2008-2009) and job
creation (22 500 person days in 2008-2009). While it could be due to our oversight, the Team has
not seen further attention to these relevant indicators.

5.3. CAPACITY — MMCT STAFF

In general, the MTR Team ﬁnds that MMCT, as an independent organisation with a lean
management structure, has performed relatively well and is able to support the development
programmes. MMCT is even respected as a dynamic and effective organisation by some
observers, expressed for example by the Mulanje Council Director of Public Planning. MMCT
enjoys high recognition and visibility in Mulanje and in some respects nationally and abroad. The
Team observed a local exception to this in a village meeting in Ndala village where a number of
participants were not aware of the ‘MMCT’ but knew well the staff supporting livelihoods
activities: we also value ‘good works’ over branding.

The multi-stakeholder MMCT Board meets quarterly to review work plans, budget and resolve
problems. The broad and high level representation provides experience and clout. The MMCT

40

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

core office in Mulanje has a small, competent and dynamic leader and staff who often go beyond
the call of duty to carry out the programmes of the organisation. Several respondents expressed
admiration for MMCT’s performance and creativity. Although the Board and the Executive
Director makes important policy decisions, core technical staff have supervised authority to
develop and follow their work plans to implement project activities. This motivates and
encourages innovativeness among staff. MMCT must be commended for retaining core
programme staff since MMCT became operational. Responding to a question as to what keeps
them at MMCT, a programme officer told the Review Team that there is a ‘feeling at home’ spirit
among staff, as they are supported by management in carrying out their programmes.

The Review Team notes that the programmes are demanding and growing in geographical
coverage and complexity (such as the high altitude conservation, forest co-management, and
livelihoods programmes). Although MMCT’s primary role is funding and facilitation, as is often
remarked, one should not underestimate the competence and work it requires to initiate, follow
up and secure high quality delivery from various governmental and non-govemmental partners.
The Team did not review organisational structures or employment conditions but received some
signals about frustration over remuneration, although staff members also appreciate the work as
being challenging and exciting. It should also be noted that conﬂict over resource management
places stress on staff, it is no coincidence that a staff involved in the encounter with the Thuchila
Estate over its possession of illegal Mulanje cedar in May 2009 asked to be relieved of duties in
law enforcement (MMCT 2009a). The success of the MMCT network relies on agency and
responsibility of programme officers, who should enjoy excellent working conditions
commensurate with their academic qualifications and experience, and should get opportunities to
develop their skills and competence further.

There is pronounced gender imbalance among MMCT professional staff: during the recruitment
of staff around 2002, only men were employed. A remarkable stafﬁng continuity has made a
transition to gender balance more difficult. This is a weakness for MMCT and the programmes,
because it limits the knowledge, perspectives and range of roles in the interaction with
communities and partners. From April 2010 the group of staff working with livelihoods has been
expanded through the USAID funded MOBI+LISE project. Of eight professional staff hired,
three are female. This is a welcome development that needs to be harnessed within MMCT. On
this occasion, MMCT also found that there was no dearth of skilled and interested female
applicants with relevant education. Partner organisations, particularly NGOs, appear, by and
large, more gender balanced. The Forestry Department, however, also has few female staff (for
example seven of about 150 staff in Phalombe, in the estimate of the DFO there). This reinforces
a male bias in the MMCT network. We see the broader issue of MMCT’s lack of a gender
strategy at all levels as one of the major challenges (further on this in section 0).

5.4. CAPACITY — PARTNERS

By design, MMCT implements most of its project activities through partner organisations, most
importantly the Forestry Department. Others include the Wildlife and Environmental Society of
Malawi (WESM), the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MOAF S), Mulanje Renewable
Energy Agency (MUREA) and, though modestly, the District Councils.

41

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 ll/Iid-Term Review

5.4.1. Forestry Department

The creation of MMCT was rooted in a strong and lasting perception that the government
through the Forest Department lacked adequate resources, both ﬁnancial, human and
institutional, to cope with the challenges of sustainable resource management on Mulanje
Mountain. The perception that the Forestry Department is under-capacitated is frequently and
strongly articulated in the project documents, even long after the launch of MMCT and the
entering of an ofﬁcial partnership with the Forestry Department. This, in itself, is an indicator of
a relationship fraught with tension. The Project Proposal to the Norwegian Government opens the
substantive section (Background to the issues) with this sweeping assessment:

The management authority, the Department of Forestry, has steadily experienced a reduction
in budgeted expenditure for operational costs and lacked the leadership to dynamically adapt
to reorganize itself based upon the commercial potential of its plantation resources. The
operational ability of the management authority has degraded, the staﬂing levels have become
inadequate, professional and technical skills have deteriorated, and inevitably the execution of
management responsibilities has declined. The state of the national economy and the impact
of HIV-AIDS were contributing factors to this demise. [....]  it was apparent that the
capacity of the management authority would continue to decline. M/IC T 200 7b: 1)

The quote is one of the many examples of the voice of lVIlVICT—as-one-actor, rather than a
lVIlVICT—multi-stakeholder voice. However, there is a need to more soberly and constructively
identify what the DFO ofﬁces with their high staff numbers (above 500 in the Phalombe and
Mulanje DFOs combined) are doing and can do. This is not to deny the weaknesses of capacity in
forestry and other public institutions. The MTR Team did observe a persistent problem of lack of
funding within the Forestry Department at district level. Again, staff turnover of District ofﬁcials
delays the implementation of planned activities. For example, the Ofﬁcer who was instrumental
in training local communities and setting-up forest co-management blocks was moved to another
district in 2010 and was replaced by a new recruit with no experience in forest co-management.

Labour conditions also require attention. Through the Forestry Department, MMCT becomes the
direct or indirect employer of staff working as guards, in forestry nurseries etc. Forestry workers
on the Mulanje Mountain informed the Team that they signed their contracts at the MMCT
ofﬁces but were unable to read the contracts (in English): the only condition of contract that they
could tell us about was the salary (MK300 or US$2 per day). The salary is above the government
prescribed wage, but is hardly a salary on which a family can make a living considering an
average family size of ﬁve persons. Furthermore, it is unacceptable that workers are not aware of
such conditions of contract as the duration, holiday, work hours, overtime pay, pension and so on.
The Team also observed that workers living on the mountain had unacceptable housing
conditions in a wood frame house covered only with a sheet of plastic, which workers told us
turned extremely cold at night (Figure 9, page 21). MMCT should review and revise its
guidelines for labour employment, including the use of contracts, wages, other remuneration and
housing, where relevant. MMCT should be an equal opportunity employer that provides good
conditions of employment including a living wage for all the staff it employs or funds.

5.4.2. The police

The Mulanje Police appreciate the relationship with MMCT and the Ofﬁcer in Charge noted that
it has enabled more effective action on criminal exploitation of mountain resources. The police

42

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 lVIid-Term Review

and MMCT staff often accompany one another in action on the mountain; sometimes the request
comes from MMCT and sometimes police receive a tip-off and inform MMCT. The police also
hold meetings, alone or with MMCT, to create public awareness about mountain issues and to
work with community policing forums, of which around ﬁfty exist. In the view of the Ofﬁcer in
Charge, joint operations between the Police and MMCT have increased the number of
conﬁscations and arrests, but he mentioned what he saw as lenient penalties for some offenders.

For Mulanje Police, the major constraint is lack of vehicles and human and ﬁnancial resources to
adequately undertake their functions. For example, the police to population ratio is about 1:3 000.
In addition, Mulanje Police has around 160 staff with only one vehicle, which in some cases has
led to cancellation of action on the mountain. MMCT has assisted with both vehicles and fuel,
but it is difﬁcult to ask: ‘The spirit of begging is always painful’. The funding situation hampers
the activity level but also generates a dependency on MMCT which may compromise the role of
a public authority (discussed further in section 0 on law enforcement as a major challenge).

5.4.3. A Public Private Partnership — an unrealised ambition

The last years of the World Bank support saw an increasing promotion of a Public Private
Partnership (PPP) to improve the autonomy, sustainability and efﬁciency of MMCT. Major
elements of the PPP are outlined in various documents, such as the joint mid-term review in
2006. The background is an assessment that:

WFR is not much better managed today than was the case at project inception’ and
‘because of a duality of roles, WC T and FD have not been able to build an eﬂective working
relationship’ (FD, WC T, and World Bank 2006: 25).

Additional problems identiﬁed were unclear responsibilities, lack of incentive systems, lack of
accountability for results, lack of human and ﬁnancial resources, lack of revenue retention at
local level while most forest utilisation is ‘illegal, inequitable and wasteful apart from being
unsustainable’ (ibid., our emphasis). The proposed PPP would involve a new partnership and
agreement between MMCT and the Forestry Department according to which (among others):

— FD would delegate the management of the Forest Reserve to MMCT but would have
inﬂuence through voting rights in the MMCT Board and through approving a (revised)
Forest Management Plan.

— MMCT would create new programmes and posts in forest management for seconded FD
staff and would retain a portion of generated revenues from the reserve (tourism, plantations,
licenses, ﬁnes etc) (FD, MMCT, and World Bank 2006: 26).

Central to the plans for a PPP was the ambition to improve local retention of revenues raised

from the MMFR. The joint MTR estimated the income as rising steadily from US$166 000 in

year 1 to US$475 000 in year 5, (FD, MMCT, and World Bank 2006: 29), it also proposed that a

share of revenues (15 to 30%) should go to the District Council. The joint MTR 2006 strongly

insisted that institutional change was needed:

The MT R concluded that the Project Objective remains attainable. However, if the
institutional arrangement proposed by the MTR is not fully implemented, it is the opinion of

43

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 ll/Iid-Term Review

the mission that the project objectives will not be attained and little improvement in the actual
management of the WFR will occur. (FD, WC T, and World Bank 2006: 4)

If not mere posturing, this suggests that MMCT and the programmes would be in deep trouble
today, almost four years later, since little progress has been made. MMCT presented a PPP
proposal and draft agreement to the Forest Department in 2007. Till today the proposed PPP is
shelved awaiting, among others, a national policy process concerning PPPs. The Director of the
Forest Department informed the MTR Team that it had several concerns about the proposed PPP,
particularly concerning the degree of control over the MMFR and incomes generated from it. A
revised version was still under review within the Department. At any rate, FD also reported that it
was awaiting the completion of the national policy process.

The Norwegian Embassy has expressed that it does not regard a PPP as a requirement, but rather
that excellent collaboration is developed, for example stressed in Annual Meetings. The Embassy
thus has a more ‘relaxed’ position on the PPP than MMCT has or had at the time when this
option was being strongly advocated.

The MTR Team observes that issue of control over public land, such as the forest reserve,
requires careful consideration and that a mutually empowering partnership, also for public sector
institutions, is needed. The Team also stresses the role of the District Council in the partnership,
as was indeed anticipated with the idea of revenue sharing mentioned above.

5.4.4. General observation on partnerships

A major achievement of MMCT is to attract international donor funding for a range of activities
and partners. The Norwegian funding has contributed directly to a number of partners and
indirectly through enhancing the credibility and leverage of the MMCT network in attracting
funding. MMCT gets credit from some of these partners for being creative and ﬂexible in
supporting capacity building. The multi-stakeholder network approach creates the capacity of
MMCT. However, it also leads to a dependency on those partners and their commitment and
capacity, when progress does not match targets (as experienced in some of the biodiversity
programmes, and on forest co-management), a response of MMCT staff is to take on more
implementation responsibility than originally planned. This may both be non-sustainable and
cause resistance within, primarily, the Forest Department at local level. The impression of the
MTR Team from earlier work in the Mulanje area was that the Oxfam livelihood programmes,
now phased out, put more emphasis on collaboration with the District Council and, on the whole,
used a more effective approach and experienced less friction in the relations with government
departments at district level (Kaunda et al. 2007).

5.5. INCOME STREAMS

The potential income streams for the MMTC network of actors are: (i) Donor funds (programmes
and core support), such as from EU, USAID and Norway, (ii) income streams generated and
retained locally by MMCT or partners, and (iii) withdrawals from the endowment fund.

(i) MMCT has continued to be successful in attracting donor funding. The Norwegian funding
amounts to NOK 5.1 million or US$ 0.9 million per year representing (at the time of the
agreement, 2007) 50% of the total MMCT budget. The MMCT budget for 2001-2011 is

44

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

estimated at US$ 1.090 million (MMCT 2010a). However, from 2010 to 2012, three years
following the calendar year, MMCT is also receiving USAID funding for the MOBI+LISE
project to the order of US$ 1.0 million per year, and a total of US$30 million. The MTR Team
understands that the budget and accounting for MOBI+LISE is done separately. In effect, then,
the proportional importance of the Norwegian funding may remain at about fifty percent.

(ii) Some MMCT partners generate funds locally. The government income from the MMFR has
been estimated at US$160 000 per year (MMCT 2008: 47), which goes to central government
treasury. The other examples we got were of relatively minor cost recovery by WESM and
MUREA. The MTR 2010 has not been informed of other examples on retention of income
streams. In a few discussions, this was linked to lack of progress on the PPP which, it was
assumed, would have generated up to US$500 000 per year (FD, MMCT, and World Bank 2006:
29). There is a risk that a slow PPP policy process is used to justify poor progress on raising and
retaining incomes. It is important to pursue income generating activities that are feasible even
without a PPP, if this can improve forest management and increase sustainability. A researcher at
FRHVI mentioned to the MTR Team that an account for retention of revenues generated from
forest has been revived as of July 2010. This would reportedly mean that the forestry department
at district level would be able to retain 80% of revenues generated from forestry activities, while
20% would go to the treasury. While we did not get this confirmed and made more specific at
DFO level, this opening should be pursued.

(iii) In accordance with the Proposal to Norway, MMCT has not drawn on its endowment fund
since late 2007 (we address the endowment fund in the following chapter).

As an effect of points i to iii, MMCT is today wholly dependent on recurrent donor funding.

5.6. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISK

The picture the MTR Team is faced with is fraught with ambiguity. On the one hand, the Team
notes the relevance, strength and impact of the project. MMCT has managed to increase the
funding for conservation and livelihoods development for itself and its partners; it has
recognition for working ﬂexibly and innovatively with a number of partners; it has provided
material support, particularly to the Forest Department in the form of motor cycles, vehicles and
allowances that enable more ﬁeld activities. It has enabled an organisation such as WESM to
operate and MUREA to become an independent organisation. On the other hand, inadequate
government funding (in the Forestry Department and the Police, for example) seriously hampers
some programmes. Deep problems in organisational capacities and relations were the background
for proposing a Public Private Partnership as a fundamentally changed mode of operation but the
fate of the proposal is mote and it is not likely to see the light of day anytime soon. The MMCT
Board (including FD) should therefore work further on the PPP or other arrangement, so that
issues are resolved and a plan ready at the time when the national policy process allows it.

The MTR Team is asked to assess risks and risk management strategies. The major risks
identiﬁed in the project document (World Bank 2001) and the 2007 Agreement is:

The primary risks to the project achievement are inadequate cooperation ﬂom the Forestry
Department, the prevalence of corruption, and conﬂict with the mountain’s neighbouring
communities. (A/IFA, GOA/I, and WC T 2007: Annex I: Agreed Project Summary).

It is surprising that the Government agrees that the major risk to the project is the non-
cooperation and corruption of one of its departments. However, corruption, the abuse of public
power for private beneﬁt, has frequently been presented as a key to the problems in management
of the Mulanje Mountain (FD, MMCT, and World Bank 2006). One problem has been collusion
between Forest Department ofﬁcials and those involved in illegal logging, from outside or inside
neighbouring communities. The Agreement addresses the risk of corruption concerning the
Norwegian funding through Article IX, which states that MMCT will ‘effect all procurement
necessary for the implementation of the Project’ and that the government shall ensure that
effective means to prevent and punish corruption are in place. While the MTR Team has
observed cases of reckless political-private pressure on ofﬁcials (in the cases of illegal timber
harvesting and exclusion of communities from forest land), our respondents did not suggest that
corruption in the form of bribery was involved in these cases. We heard other claims that corrupt
practices persist and it requires continuous scrutiny because it violates the public orientation and
long-term considerations of the project.

In the Project Proposal to the Norwegian Government, the PPP is seen as a key strategy to
‘address most of the anticipated risks’ for the MMCT partnership (MMCT 2007b: page 11). It is
a weakness of the Project Proposal and the Agreement that other risk mitigating strategies are
neglected in a situation where there was, in fact, considerable uncertainty about the proposed
PPP. The MTR therefore ﬁnds that there is a need to re-assess risk and management strategies
and to update this in connection with the renewed strategic planning that we are recommending.

The Team has, through our attention in other sections, conﬁrmed that we continue to see both
lack of cooperation (section 0) and conﬂict (section 0) as major risk factors. In this way we agree

46

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

with the previous assessment. The MTR Team has, however, ampliﬁed the attention to the law
enforcement approach as a potential source of conﬂict.

The Team inquired about a potential threat to the environment. Mulanje Mountain has been
investigated as a potential site for bauxite mining and an Environmental Impact Assessment
carried out (as reported in MMCT 2009c: 1). This could pose a threat to environmental qualities,
among others because bauxite is concentrated in the Lichenya area, which is important for
Mulanje cedar conservation. The current assessment by MMCT, based on recent information
from the licensed prospecting company Gondo Resources, is that it is not likely to pursue bauxite
mining, as it is not regarded as financially viable. This could, however, change as the government
may seek to source other investors. At the time of the MMCT Annual Report 2008-2009, there
was some secrecy around the matter, for example the company doing the EIA would not disclose
its client. This draws attention to a general risk factor, namely lack of transparency in planning
and development, which could potentially affect other sectors such as energy or water resource
development. Government commitment to transparency is an important risk mitigating factor.

The MTR Team has paid attention to the risk posed by the conﬂict with a major power-holder
over the illegal forest extraction and exclusion of communities. Such threats will arise in many
contexts, the real risk is associated with the capability of the organisation and the government of
addressing it. So far this capability has not been shown, which is linked to a fear of addressing
the issue in public (while individuals are frank in talking about it in a face to face situation). Such
fear also created a dilemma for the MTR Team. We chose to confront the issue, because of the
injustice caused and because lack of openness will undermine the learning and development
process that MMCT and partners depend on. An open atmosphere, where neither hierarchy nor
fear hinders learning, is a fundamental requirement to be able to address threats and risks.

There is a need for multiple strategies to address sustainability, which is multi-dimensional. It is
important to nurture sustainability of programmes and outputs at community level (building their
links and capacity to mobilise funds and other resources). One needs to do the same for smaller
partner organisations in the area. There is risk attached to the funding situation, as there always
will be, and it is important to plan for a next phase of donor support, as two major programmes
(Norway and USAID) come to an end in 2012 (the endowment fund is addressed in the next
chapter). It is also important to avoid practices that are not financially sustainable in a scenario
without foreign donor support. The MMTC Board needs to engage in political processes of
securing more resource for public units and programmes that are important for Mulanje
Mountain. Even with the proposed PPP, it will be futile for MMCT to try to assume the role of
government. One test of MMCT success is whether it can move from being a forum where issues
are discussed, which is very valuable, to also being a political actor that can affect governance
and secure more resources for agencies that are vital to the Mulanje Mountain and the
communities that depend on it.

6. OBJECTIVE 5: DEMONSTRATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE
ENDOWMENT FUND

6.1. BACKGROUND

MMCT took over responsibility for an endowment fund of US$5.45 million in April 2005. The
fund is managed by the Arbor Group of UBS bank. The endowment fund is invested in cash and
cash alternatives (12%), equity (50%), ﬁxed income (36%) and broad commodities (2%) (UBS
2010). While dollar denominated, the investment is spread over 42 countries. The fund pursues
steady real returns of 5% (7% nominal, assuming 2% inﬂation).23

MMCT’s objective concerning the endowment, as stated in the original PAD project document
(World Bank 2001) and the Project Proposal to the Norwegian Government, is to ‘demonstrate
the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as financing mechanism for biodiversity
conservation’ (MlVlCT 2007). The anticipated outputs and outcome/impact indicators state that
MMCT (i) is adequately funded, (ii) has collective knowledge on conservation trust funds, (iii)
continues to receive contributions, and (iv) is cited by GEF and others as a positive example of
the funding of conservation. Critical assumptions are that GEF and the World Bank will continue
to provide support and follow up the implementation(MMCT 2007b: Appendix 1).24

The Project Proposal (MMCT 2007: 4) also argues that ‘there is a crucial need to enable this
endowment model to function adequately by seeking a substantial increase in capital that will in
turn provide in future the desired income stream’. It estimates that an annual withdrawal on the
fund of USD450 000 would be ‘ideal’ and that a principal of about US$8.3 million would be
needed to allow this.

The TOR for the MTR echoes the ‘crucial need’ to increase the endowment fund and asks the
team to ‘assess progress being made to increase the endowment capacity to the desired level’. In
the following, we therefore review some aspects of the endowment fund. Our major points are
that the fund has been managed reasonably well through the almost unprecedented financial crisis
of the period. However, the factor of inﬂation in Malawi has not been adequately considered and
therefore the endowment fund is far from being a sustainable and adequate funding mechanism.

6.2. THE 2007 PROJECTION

The Project Proposal application to Norway (August 2007) projected a growth of the endowment
fund at an annual rate of 7.5% from US$60 million in 2007 to US$8.3 million by 2012.
Thereafter, a sustainable withdrawal of 5.5%, about US$450 000 per year, would be possible,
while maintaining the real value of the fund through ploughing 2% back in the fund to off-set the
effect of inﬂation. This is also shown in Table I in Appendix 5. A weakness in the projection is
that it does not take into account that the real value (in 2007 dollars or Malawi kwacha) of the
withdrawal from 2012 will be lower, around US$407 000 rather than the stated US$450 000
(nominal value).

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 4 A/Iid-Term Review

The assumptions about rate of return (7.5%) and inﬂation (2%) were optimistic. The assumption
about inﬂation is not explained in the Project Proposal. We assume that it refers to the inﬂation
rate in Malawi adjusted for changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and Malawi
kwacha. For example, assuming 6% inﬂation in Malawi, the annual depreciation of the kwacha
against the dollar would have to be 4% to get an effective inﬂation rate of 2%.

The performance of the fund is highly vulnerable to inﬂation. Table II (Appendix 5) shows a
projection with the same rate of return (7.5%) and an average effective inﬂation rate of 4% per
year in the 2007 to 2012 period. In this scenario, the nominal value of the endowment fund, the
rate of return and withdrawal will be unchanged. However, the real value of the withdrawal from
2012 will only be US$360 000, and it will decline steadily along with the real value of the
endowment fund over the ensuing years. Thus, the break in withdrawals from 2008 to 2012
would not be enough to reach a sustainable and adequate funding. This underpins the claim of the
Project Proposal that it is necessary to increase the endowment fund. However, one gets the
impression that the problems of high inﬂation and risk with regard to the exchange rate are
understated. It is apparently assumed that dollar strength will continue to make up for high
inﬂation in Malawi.

6.3. PERFORMANCE 2005 TO 2010

The endowment fund performed extremely well in the years 2005 to 2007. Our crude estimate25
of the rate of return is 10 to 12% nominal return in those years. The next period of Norwegian
support witnessed a major challenge to the endowment fund in the form of global ﬁnancial crisis
and economic recession. This came as a shock to the trustees, who did not think that such a crisis
would hit investments in the US, which they regarded as a strong economy.26 However, the
endowment fund has been fairly resilient and gathered strength in the recent year to slightly
surpass its nominal level at the beginning of the period. According to the UBS fund manager, the
endowment fund has performed better than other major investors in the US (draft Annual Report
2009-2010, page 3). The Programme Director, Malawi Environmental Endowment Trust
(MEET) also commended MMCT for good fund management, since he had seen the MEET
endowment fund (invested exclusively in Malawi) dwindle to about ﬁfty percent during the
ﬁnancial and economic crisis.

MMCT made a number of withdrawals in the period 2005 to 2007 which in total amounted to
about US$1.0million, or NOK 6.1 million, or MK 141.3 million (Table 12). MMCT withdrawals
amounted to an estimated 54% of the return in the period 2005 to 2010 and were too big to allow
that the real value of the fund be maintained.

 

25 Despite efforts before, during and after the visit to MMCT, the MTR Team did not manage to receive information
on the historical record of the MMCT endowment, except the withdrawals (Table 12). We therefore estimated the
size of the fund at the start and beginning of each year based on not fully accurate figures in various reports. The
difficulty of obtaining such information was disappointing.

Source: Email ﬁ'om Arbor group, UBD dated 5 October 2010. Figures in 1000 US$ (NOK, MK)

As per September 2010, the MMCT endowment fund stood at US$62 million. No withdrawals
have been made since 2007. MMCT has managed without withdrawals because of Norwegian
and other funding received for administration and project activities.

Table 111 (Appendix 5) shows the historical performance of the fund from the initial endowment
of US$5 450 000 was received in 2005 to a projected end value of US$6 300 000 at the end of
2010. The inﬂation rate in Malawi 2005 to 2009 varied between 7.9% and 13.9% (average
10.4%). The inﬂation rate appears to be on a slight downward trend and has been fairly stable
around 8% from 2008 to 2010. The effective inﬂation rate is calculated by taking consumer price
inﬂation and subtracting increased dollar strength. The exchange rate between US$ and Malawi
kwacha changed from MK118 to the dollar in 2005 to MK150 to the dollar in 2010. The kwacha
depreciated by an average of 5% per year in the period. The effective inﬂation varied between
2.9% and 8.9% from 2005 to 2010, with an average of 5%. The performance (rate of return) of
the investments has to be equal to the effective inﬂation rate to maintain the value of the fund.
The performance has to beat the effective inﬂation rate in order for the fund to grow or make
sustainable withdrawals.

From 2005 to 2010, we estimate that the nominal rate of return was 5.6%, thus barely beating the
effect of inﬂation. A sustainable withdrawal would only have been 0.5% of total fund value, or
about US$27,000 per year. The fund increased its nominal value by 16% in the period, while the
real value has decreased by -12% due to the effect of inﬂation and the withdrawal (from US$5.45
million to US$ 4.81 million, see Table III).

Few predicted at the time that the rate of return would decline as dramatically as it did. However,
the projection was highly vulnerable to higher inﬂation rates, which would have been a realistic
assumption given the high inﬂation in Malawi, which was an average of 16% per annum in the
four years prior to that (27% in 2003, 10% in 2004, 12% in 2005 and 15% in 2006) (IndexMundi
2010). It is surprising that this was not discussed in the Project Proposal of 2007.

Table IV indicates, again with the same fairly crude calculation, what the situation would have
been if the rate of return on the investments had been as anticipated (7.5%) in the real economic
climate of Malawi. Then, from 2005 to 2010, the nominal value of the fund would have increased
from US$5 450 000 to US$8 411 000 (or by 54%). The increase in real value would have been
from US$5 450 000 to US$6 423 000 (or by 18%). This would correlate to a real return of about

50

 

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 lVIid-Term Review

2.8% per year, available for growing the fund or for withdrawals. It compares with the projected
ﬁgure of 5.5%. In the documents reviewed the ﬁnancial instability has received considerable
attention while the factor of inﬂation (adjusted for changes in the exchange rate) has not. Our
crude assessment suggests that the real rate of return was about half of the projected, and that
ﬁnancial instability aﬂecting the investments explains half of the underperformance while the

high eﬂective inflation rate in Malawi ( even taking relative dollar strength into account) explains
the other half.

To some extent the problem stems from poor advice given by the World Bank in the start-up
phase. The Project Appraisal Document argued that the project could continue ‘in perpetuity’
based on an annual investment income estimated at US$300 000 to 350 000 (World Bank 2001:
35). In a zero inﬂation environment this would have worked well, with 3% effective inﬂation, an
annual rate of return of 9.5% would have been needed. However, for example a 7% rate of return
coupled with 4% inﬂation (much lower than the previous phase, and slightly below what ensued),
would only have yielded a sustainable withdrawal of US$158 000 per year. Coupled with an
inﬂation of 5%, which actually followed, only about US$ 105 000 would have been available on
a sustainable basis. GEF/World Bank aimed to provide ‘sustainable in-country funding for
biodiversity conservation of the Mulanje Massif and surrounding area’ (World Bank 2001: 39).
We feel that the GEF /World Bank did not provide MMCT with a funding mechanism but rather
a leverage for attracting other donor funding and a buffer against hard times.

6.4. PROJECTIONS WITHOUT NEW INJECTIONS IN THE FUND

In the 2007 proposal document to Norway, MMCT aimed to increase the fund to US$ 8.3 million
by 2012. However, the reality of high inﬂation is catching up with unrealistic assumptions, as
seen in the MMCT assessment of the desirable level of the principal and the withdrawal:

The endowment is the most reliable source of long-term funding, and we believe it would be
most appropriate to maintain a balance of US$ 25 million, which would generate
$1 250 00027 per year of core funding for WC T essential conservation projects and
services’ (draft Annual Report 2009-2010 given to the team on 16 September, page 3).

We hasten to add that the Executive Director suggested that this was a too high or too optimistic
goal at present and suggested US$10 million as a realistic target for the endowment.28

Due to the ﬁnancial crisis and the persistent high rate of inﬂation in Malawi, these are not likely
to be reached without substantial additional injections into the fund. Table V shows a projection
with a (highly optimistic) yield of 10% per annum and an effective inﬂation rate of 3% per
annum. It would then require about two years (till 2012) to reach the US$83 million target in
nominal value but about 4 years (till 2014) to reach the US$8.3 million target in real value,
despite making no withdrawals in the period. From 2007 a sustainable, real value yield of about
US$ 625,000 per year is possible but the scenario is unrealistic.

 

27 This assumes an effective yield of 5%, approximately as per the assumptions in the application to Norway of 7.5%
rate of return and about 2.0 % inﬂation.

28 On the assumptions in the footnote above, a US$10 million fund would allow a withdrawal of US$500,000 per
year. To provide for ﬁnancial sustainability, the drafter of the annual report was probably right, as we note later.

51

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 4 lVIid—Term Review

Compared to the assumptions in the 2007 Project Proposal, Table VI presents a more realistic
rate of return (5%) and an effective inﬂation rate of 3% (down from 5% in the previous period, it
may still be too optimistic). MMCT assumed in 2007 that 5.5 of the 7.5% rate of return would be
available to grow the fund, or 73% of the return. A major difference is that in the scenario in
Table IV, only 40% of the return is available to grow the fund or to fund programmes, since 60%
is needed to maintain the real value of the fund. It would take about ﬁve years (till 2015) to reach
the US$8.3 million target in nominal value and about 14 years (till 2024) to reach the US$83
million target in real value, despite making no withdrawals in the period (and assuming ﬁnancial
stability). While perhaps realistic, the dependency on programme support will persist and MMCT
will miss its goal of being an endowment funded organisation with the attendant advantages.

6.5. THE ENDOWMENTS FUND: PATHS TO FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

If the objectives, capacity and performance of MMCT are deemed worthy of support, a ﬁnancial
consideration suggests that a substantial increase in the endowment fund is required. For a period
of time, both core support and injections into the principal will be required. Three paths to
sustainability are suggested. These paths are not suggested based on any kind of discussion with
or knowledge about the plans of any donor, but rather to indicate possibilities and the level of
resources needed. In fact, given a perhaps more realistic assessment of rates of return and the
problem of inﬂation, the option of making injections to the endowment fund may appear less
attractive to donors.

Table VIII shows an optimistic scenario. The path follows the assumptions stated in the 2007
proposal to Norway (7.5% yield, 2% inﬂation) so that 5.5% is available for either increment in
the real value of the endowment or for programme funding. It suggests continued core
programme support by Norway and/or other donors in a further ﬁve year period (2012 to 2016)
combined with annual injection of US$1.0 million.29 It will bring the real value of the
endowment fund to about US$14 million by 2016. The endowment fund can then be maintained
at an annual withdrawal equivalent to about 2/3 (66%) of the rate of return, or about US$700 000
withdrawal in real value.30 Despite being optimistic in its assumptions about yield, inﬂation and
capital injections, the scenario portrays a moderate level of sustainable funding.

Table VIII shows a more cautious scenario. Here the assumptions are: 6% yield and 3% inﬂation,
so that 3% is available for increasing the endowment or for programme funding. In this scenario
an annual injection of about US$3.0 million per year during the ﬁve years 2012 to 2016 would be
required to reach sustainability by 2016 (NOK 18 million per year and NOK 90 million in total).
This would have to come in addition to programme support in the period. By 2017, the real value
of the principal will have grown to about US$21 million. A withdrawal of 3% (equivalent to 50%
of the annual yield) can maintain this principal. However, this withdrawal amounts to only about
US$615,000 per year (NOK 3.7 million), somewhat below the current funding level and only half
of what MMCT now deems desirable.

Table IX shows another optimistic scenario. Here donors agree to make a large once-off injection
to the fund: US$32 million in 2012. At a 6% annual rate of return is 3% effective inﬂation a

 

29 This corresponds to NOK6 million per year at today’s exchange rate, repeated over five years, i.e. NOK30 million.
30 Equal to about NOK4.2 million per year, close to the current Norwegian support, but far below the US$1.25
million per year deemed desirable in the draft MMCT draft Annual Report 2009-2010.

52

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

sustainable, real value withdrawal of just over US$10 per year is possible from 2013. We partly
present the scenario to show the challenges of reaching an adequate and sustainable funding
level. It does not appear highly realistic, but with some success with several donors over the
coming few years it could be within reach. It would provide a ﬁrm basis for maintaining
conservation and development activities at an acceptable level, making the goal of managing
Mulanje Mountain and involving communities with a truly long-term perspective attainable.

6.6. CONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE ENDOWMENT FUND

The sub-obj ective: ‘Demonstrate the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as ﬁnancing
mechanism for biodiversity conservation’. Overall throughout the years, MlVICT has
demonstrated both some of the potential and some of the major risks in funding biodiversity
conservation through managing an environmental fund.

The major achievements and strengths are: Firstly, succeeding in attracting a substantial
endowment fund of US$ 5.45 million, secondly succeeding in partially funding development
programmes in 2005 to 2007 through drawing on it, thirdly in using a professional fund manager
that steered the fund through the financial crisis of 2008 to 2010 with smaller losses than
comparative investors in the US and globally. The consequence is that a substantial fund of US$
6.2 million is available to MMCT as per September 2010, fourth, no doubt the availability of the
fund has increased the credibility of MMCT and its attractiveness to donors, who see that the
prospects for financial sustainability (and therefore long-term programmes and impact) are
greater than without such an endowment, ﬁfth, some general advantages of an international fund
as opposed to a national fund (despite high internal bank rates) are: one reduces the risk of (i)
currency exchange shocks, (ii) corruption and government appropriation and (iii) low real returns
over t1me.

The major set-backs and weaknesses are: First, one gets an impression that the donors, the
MMCT Board, and managers have made overly optimistic assumptions concerning the available
annual return that would maintain the real value of the fund, primarily because inﬂation has been
underestimated and/or the impact of kwacha depreciation overestimated. Secondly, and as a
result, the annual rate of return proved inadequate in 2005, 2006 and 2007, negatively affecting
conservation programmes (ﬁre prevention had to be dramatically reduced and fighting of
invasive alien species and replanting had to be halted).32 Thus, the advantage of an endowment
fund — enabling continuity and focus on long-term goals — was missed. Thirdly, it became
necessary to seek core/programme funding, which introduces the risks and weaknesses of such
funding.33 Fourthly, the global financial and economic crisis has made vivid the risk attached to
the capital investments. Therefore, it is more challenging to reach a sustainable principal and
yield in real terms than anticipated. In the foreseeable future, MMCT will depend on both core
support and substantial fresh injections.

Considering the outputs/impact indicators, 34 the MTR notes the following:

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 ll/Iid-Term Review

- WCT is adequately funded? No, MMCT so far does not have an adequately funded
sustainable ﬁnancing mechanism for long-term investments in biodiversity conservation.
Depending on the assumptions and the desired level of activity, injections of US$5 to 35
million appear to be required.

- WCT has collective knowledge on conservation trust funds? MlVlCT has clearly gained
experience with endowment trust management. The MTR Team has not been able to ascertain
how broad or deep the ‘collective knowledge’ is. The lack of attention to the problem of
inﬂation suggests inadequate analysis.

- WCT continues to receive contributions? Yes, MMCT has been successful in attracting core
function and programme support (e.g. Norway, USAID and EU), but not so far in attracting
new injections into the endowment fund.

- WC T is cited by GEF and others as a positive example in the funding of conservation?
MMCT enjoys some recognition in Malawi and beyond. As mentioned, Malawi
Environmental Endowment Trust (MEET) cited MMCT as a positive example. Involvement in
creating the African Environmental Endowment Trust Network, where the MMCT Executive
Director is the Chair, is positive and brings recognition. Otherwise, it would be equally
relevant to mention MMCT’s experience as an example of some of the serious challenges of
relying on endowment trust funding.

Overall the endowment fund puts MMCT on a stronger footing than most other environmental
organisations in Malawi and it has developed a professional and reliable system for managing the
endowment fund. It is therefore attractive for a donor to contribute to the further development of
this potential, as they can see their contribution augmented by that of investments already made.
It should be noted that the problem of staying abreast with a high level of inﬂation affects
programme support as well as an endowment fund.35

The MTR Team agrees with the assessment made by MMTC that there is a need to secure rapid
injections in the endowment fund. Based on the Team’s analysis of the impact of fund injections,
inﬂation and exchange rates and annual withdrawals, a substantially higher principal, probably in
the order of US$25 to 35 million, is required to support long-term investments in the
conservation of biodiversity on the Mulanje Mountain.

The Team recommends that MMTC explores the possibilities for obtaining contributions to the
fund with a range of donors, including Norway. In earlier discussion with the Norwegian
Embassy, MMCT representatives were advised that Norway’s policy is to not contribute to funds
controlled abroad. This policy is changing. For example, Norway has recently made a major
injection of capital in to a Brazilian Amazon Fund for forest conservation, to which it is so far the
only contributor (Dalen 2010). Norway has contributed NOK300 million so far and committed
further funding subject to adequate progress in halting deforestation. The fund is controlled by
Brazilian authorities and created and managed on the condition of non-interference by Norway in
the allocation of funds. Norway has also committed funding to the Congo Basin Forest Fund in
Central Africa. This demonstrates a new policy stance on foreign environmental funds. The MTR
Team conﬁrmed with a senior advisor in NORAD that Norwegian practice, and perhaps policy,
concerning funding foreign environmental trusts has changed. However, the official has also

 

35 As seen in Table III, the compound factor for 2010 is 0.76, reﬂecting the inﬂation and exchange rate changes from
2005. It means that a programme setting out with the same nominal level of funding in 2010 as it enjoyed in 2005,
will have experienced a 25% cut in real terms.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

pointed out to the Team that the sources of funding used for the Amazon and Congo Basin trust
funds are currently not applicable to projects in Malawi.

Subject to progress on other fronts, including the resolution of conﬂict concerning forest co-
management, the MTR team recommends that the Norwegian Government seriously considers
the granting of endowment funding as part of its support in a new phase of collaboration with
MMCT from 2012. An organisation, management structure, institutional arrangements and
competent fund manager are already in place and the purpose of conserving the forest resources
and biodiversity of Mulanje Mountain is well in line with Norwegian Government priorities.

7. POLICY CONTEXT AND RELEVANCE

7.1. MMBCP AND MALAWI GOVERNMENT POLICIES

The Constitution of the Republic of Malawi recognizes that the responsible management of the
environment is needed in order to halt environmental degradation, conserve and enhance the
biological diversity. It also recognizes that according status to the rights of future generations
through environmental protection and sustainable development of natural resources can make an
important contribution towards achieving sustainable economic development and improve the
standards of living. To support this constitutional provision, the Government of Malawi
developed the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) as a framework for integrating
environmental protection and management in all national development programmes in order to
preserve biodiversity, natural resources and the environment while benefiting of the poorest
members of society (Malawi Government 1994).

In the 1990s, the Government of Malawi formulated the National Forestry Policy and the
Forestry Act was passed by parliament (Malawi Government 1996, Republic of Malawi 1997).
This created a policy for community-based forest management of natural woodlands on
customary land and protected forests. For many years, people living adjacent to Mulanje
Mountain were not allowed to collect non-timber forest products such as fuel wood, fruits and
mushrooms. The MMBCP component of forest co-management employs one of the new policy
options and, despite setbacks, has initiated partnership between the government and communities
on a pilot basis.

Since Malawi is heavily dependent on natural resources for its economic development, many
policies emphasize sustainable management and utilization of natural resources. For example, the
MGDS recognizes that sustainable economic growth requires sustainable natural resource
management and efficient use of energy (Malawi Government 2006). The MGDS has long term
goals for achieving the growth aspirations of the country, including increased agricultural
productivity, increased ﬁsheries production, improved forestry wild life management and
environmental protection. A long-term goal of the MGDS is to conserve the natural resource base
through sustainable use and management of natural resources and the environment.

To support the goals in the MGDS, the Government of Malawi has formulated the Agriculture
Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp), which aims to increase agricultural productivity and
agricultural sector growth, in order to diversify food production to improve food security and
nutrition and increase incomes from agriculture (Malawi Government 2010a). The ASWAp is
based on the priority agricultural elements of the MGDS and a priority investment programme in
the agricultural sector. It is also consistent with the Comprehensive African Agricultural
Development Programme (CAADP) under the umbrella of the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development (NEPAD) (Malawi Government 2010b).

The MMBCP supports the Malawian government’s efforts in contributing towards the

conservation of natural resources as enshrined in the Malawi Constitution, forestry policy and
legislation, the MDGS, and ASWAp.

56

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review
7.2. RELEVANCE OF MMBCP TO INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND PROTOCOLS

At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, more than 178 countries including Malawi signed the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, which came into force in March 1994 (UNFCCC
2010). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), negotiated under the auspices of the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), was adopted during UNCED in 1992. Its aims
are to conserve biological diversity, the sustainable use of biological resources, and ensure a fair
and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.

Following UNCED, the Government of Malawi developed the National Environmental Action
Plan (NEAP) in 1994 to guide the design and implementation of environmental projects in the
country. In 2006, the Government developed Malawi’s National Adaptation Programme of
Action (NAPA) with the primary objective of promoting adaptation to the adverse impacts of
climate change among rural communities (Malawi Government 2006/2008). The NAPA was
submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for
funding considerations to address adverse impacts of climate change on vulnerable rural
communities and areas. Among the priority projects identified in NAPA include improving
community resilience to climate change through the development of sustainable rural livelihoods.
According to the World Bank (2001), the MMBCP is consistent with COP guidance that seeks to
encourage conservation and sustainable use of threatened habitats and endemic species within a
vulnerable mountain ecosystem. It responds to COP3 and COP4 guidance through capacity
building for better forest management and by taking an ecosystem approach that fosters improved
forest management and sustainable use across an altitudinal gradient of different habitat types
under different management regimes. The project further responds to COP4 guidance by
promoting incentive measures and community involvement in forest management specifically to
attain conservation objectives, including removal of alien species.

Priority areas in the NAPA are consistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity’s
emphasis on conserving biodiversity and natural resources for maintaining the ecosystem while
providing sources of livelihood. Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (United Nations 1992) recognizes
mountain environments as essential to the survival of the global ecosystem as they are an
important source of water, energy minerals, forest products, agricultural products, recreation and
biological diversity. The same applies to the Mulanje Mountain which is host to unique afro-
montane vegetation and a large number of endemic ﬂora and fauna species.

The core components of the MMBCP complement government efforts in responding to global
environmental commitments such as the CBD. For example, the CBD calls upon governments (a)
to adopt measures for the recovery and rehabilitation of threatened species and for their
reintroduction into their natural habitats (Article 9c), (b) to develop measures to prevent the
introduction of, control or eradication of alien species that threaten ecosystems, habitats or
species (Article 8h), (c) to adopt economically and socially sound measures that act as incentives
for the conservation and sustainable use of components of biological resources (Article 11), and
(d) to promote and encourage understanding of the importance of and the measures required for
the conservation of biological biodiversity through media and educational programmes (Article
13a). We have noted that the MMBCP is relevant for Malawi’s compliance with such provisions.

57

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

We also noted, as MMCT (2010b) does, that the emphasis in Article 10 on promoting sustainable
utilisation should get more attention in the documents.

7.3. MMBCP AND NORWEGIAN DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION POLICY

The Norwegian Government has been supporting the Government of Malawi in various
development programmes indirectly through the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC), multilateral and non-governmental organizations since the 1980s. However, Malawi
formally became a priority country for Norwegian development cooperation in 1997. The
objective of Norwegian involvement was to support Malawi's own endeavours towards achieving
sustainable economic, social and political development, as expressed in the Malawi Poverty
Alleviation Programme. Between 2001 and 2005, Norwegian development support to Malawi
focused on the sectors of health, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, good governance, macro-economic
reform as well as budget support.

The Norwegian Government developed an Action Plan for Environment in Development
Cooperation which sets the direction for Norway’s efforts during the ten year period 2006-2015.
The Plan aims to contribute towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
making it possible for poor people to improve their living conditions, health and reduce their
vulnerability (Government of Norway 2006, Norad 2009). Human induced global climate
change, and measures to both mitigate and adapt to such change, is a major concern of the
Norwegian Government (Government of Norway 2008), which underpins development
cooperation policies, also with Malawi. The environmental cooperation between Norway and
Malawi followed aspirations and efforts, as outlined in the above-described national policy
documents, particularly the MGDS and ASWAp, correspond well with the general development
and environmental objectives of the Norwegian development assistance. While the MTR Team
notes that Norwegian Government emphasis on gender issues (for example expressed in
Government of Norway 2007) is not reﬂected in the MMBCP. As such, the Norwegian support to
MMCT for the Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project addresses signiﬁcant
priorities of the governments of both Norway and Malawi related to the environment, sustainable
development and human livelihoods and provides opportunities for examining the effects of
global climate change and promote adaptation practices.

8. MAJOR CHALLENGES

8.1. INTRODUCTION

The MTR Team agrees with stakeholders who observed that MMCT’s sourcing of funds for
biodiversity conservation and livelihood interventions have assisted the government, particularly
the Forestry Department, in carrying out its mandate. There is also a need to focus on challenges,
problems or weaknesses. This chapter focuses on issues mentioned in previous chapters and
which in the opinion of the MTR Team are critical to project failure or success. They are
complex and difﬁcult issues that we cannot claim a deep insight in but present in the spirit of
critical engagement with the highly challenging reality that MMCT and partners are facing. The
MMCT Executive Director has correctly observed that in Malawi the most difﬁcult areas in
which to achieve progress may be the most worthy of effort.

8.2. MMCT-FOREST DEPARTMENT RELATIONS AND COOPERATION

The Review Team notes that the success of MMCT hinges on continued cooperation between
MMCT and the Forestry Department. Over the years of MMCT’s existence, the relations with the
Forest Department have frequently been described as problematic and it was a contributing factor
when the World Bank decided not to extend its support beyond the ﬁrst phase.36 Based on the
assessment of several stakeholders, the relationship has improved substantially in the current
phase, although problems still remain. Personnel changes in the Forest Department at HQ and
DFO level have played a positive role, there is greater interaction in planning, meetings and ﬁeld
operatiosns. MMCT Board members presented it as a major change from the earlier phase to the
present.

However, we still ﬁnd that the relationship can be, and needs to be, improved in several respects.
It is still a perception in the DFOs that joint planning is not genuine, because of MMCT control
of resources and tendency to dictate the frame, take decisions and in some cases abandon jointly
made plans. A forest ofﬁcial said that a planning meeting ‘should be a meeting of heads, not of
lap-tops’. He was concerned that too much content and too many constraints were determined in
advance and asked for a ‘clean slate approach’. MMCT staff in return express that FD staff are
not always active and forthcoming in planning processes. The relationship is not characterised by
trust and one gets the impression that ‘discourse’ or myths about the other party are also
hampering a fruitful collaboration, more so than real disagreement about forest management or
otherwise. Therefore, improved interaction, as is happening with the FD staff now delegated to
the MMCT Ofﬁce, and on the ﬁeld trip with the MTR team, is important.

The MTR Team has noted that documents, including plans, are frequently worded from the
viewpoint of MMCT, rather than as outcomes of truly shared processes, this underpins the
critical points raised by FD staff. The Proposal to Norway is written from the perspective and in
the tone of MMCT, highly disparaging of Forestry Department capacity. Another example is the
Management Plan 2007-2010 for the Forest Reserve. It is printed in the name of MMCT and the

37 Discussion between MMTC Board and MTR Team 23 September.

59

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

acknowledgments state that MMCT ‘compiled’ the plan based on discussions with different
stakeholders and that ‘a wide consultation was made with Forestry Department’ (MMCT 2007a:
i). But surely MMCT could not make a forest management plan by ‘consulting’ the FD. Here, in
the Team’s view, MMCT encroaches upon the public authority of the FD and in a blunt manner.
The Plan also refers to an attached ‘PPP document’ and the ‘slight shift in authority’ that it
entails. However, this PPP had not been approved by Forestry Department at the time, so it
appeared unreasonable to base a management plan on it. It is also noted that ‘all management
actions taking place within the boundaries of the Forest Reserve  will be executed by and under
the guidance of the Forestry Department’. Thus, while MMCT is in the driver’s seat regarding
the planning, the implementation remains the duty of the Forestry Department. This, in turn, is
contradicted by an account in the document where it is stated that ‘from 2004 to 2007
considerable efforts were made by MMCT to evacuate close to 138 encroachers who covered
close to 81ha of the forest’. Here, again, one gets an impression of MMCT overstepping its
jurisdiction, which cannot include evicting people from the forest reserve.

MMCT argued in some contexts that if it did not take such planning, leadership, and action, they
would otherwise not happen.38 That may be so. Nevertheless, the MTR ﬁnds that it is necessary,
both under the current institutional arrangements and under a possible PPP, to improve the
planning process itself. We think it requires more clariﬁcation of roles, and thus more reﬂection
by both MMCT and FD staff on the relationship and the challenges and possibilities it poses.
Such reﬂections need to include issues of ‘power’ and ‘agency’ and how these are presented in
various documents and meetings.

The inadequate government funding to the Forest Department at the district level is also a great
reason for concern. Some FD ofﬁcials at the district level perceive that FD headquarters are
justifying the lack of funding by referring to the fact that MMCT has got resources. Lack of
funding for operations underpins the dependency on MMCT, which in turn undermines
collaboration on equal terms. Underfunding of public institutions also affects the police and is a
major constraint for the protection and management of natural resources in the Mulanje
watershed. In the ﬁrst phase of the project the Government of Malawi made a ﬁnancial
commitment that was not honoured. In the current phase, the Government of Norway did not
request a ﬁnancial commitment by the Malawian Government to be included in the tri-partite
project agreement.39 However, Government commitment to the Agreement must be expected to
include that (i) the basic capacity to operate of the participating public institutions is upheld and
(ii) that funding is not directed away from the geographical area and district level institutions in
view of the availability of donor funding.

MMCT’s mission is to create a ‘new MMCT’ that speaks with credibility for a broad network of
stakeholders: ‘MMCT is a collaborative partnership ...’, says its mission statement (MMCT
2008b). In the Team’s view, this ideal has yet to be realised. The MMTC Board must look at the
MMCT ofﬁce as one member of a larger family, and it must ensure that proposals (such as the
PPP) and plans (such as the Forest Management Plan 2007-2010) are the result of genuinely
shared processes and shared ambitions of all stakeholders. Of course, one cannot expect a
seamless and frictionless collaboration considering the extent of mistrust and misunderstanding
between MMCT and Forestry Department that have prevailed since MMCT got established. The

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

MMCT Board must be a forum for robust debate (we have the impression that it already is) but
also for compromise and conﬂict resolution, so that the Board can sustain genuine political
backing both from above and below. It has to be matched by equally robust and genuine
processes at implementer level: it is good to note that the change is in this direction.

8.3. GENDER RELATIONS AND GENDER EQUALITY

Gender is in most social contexts a major source of discrimination causing unequal access to
power, resources and ultimately different human outcomes in wealth, health, safety and so on.
The National Gender Policy addresses key issues in the Malawian context (Malawi Government
2000). Norwegian gender policy stresses political and economic participation and health and
protection against violence (Government of Norway 2007). Important international policy
commitments exist in CEDAW, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women (United Nations 1979) and the Protocol to the African Charter on
the rights of Women (African Union 2003). CEDAW calls upon states to take all appropriate
measures to realise all human rights on a basis of equality of men and women. The Protocol
stresses the duty of governments to ensure women’s access to natural resources, water and energy
on equal terms with men. A recent study has made a thorough review of gender in relation to
human development in Malawi, particularly the Millennium Development Goals (Liwewe 2010).
A chapter in another study pays particular attention to gender and natural resources management
in southern Malawi and notes that in the study area women typically had use and access rights to
resources but less control over them, especially if the economic beneﬁts were high (Mawaya and
Kalindekafe 2010).

We believe gender relations impinge signiﬁcantly on the issues addressed, for example, women
are disproportionately affected by the increased workload of poor access to fire wood and
drinking water. Some of the programmes supported by MMCT, such as forest co-management
for better access to fire wood or the provision of drinking water, are likely to have a particularly
positive effect on women’s workload. Discrimination against women in certain forms of
decision-making, such as in professional organisations, traditional leadership institutions is fairly
widespread. Two women from Mbewa (Figure 15), also forest committee members, said that
some women were interested in working as guides and guards on the mountain, but were
hindered from doing so by men. We noted the high level of participation of women in forestry
activities and how in the village of Chanasa, the forest committee comprised women, while
members emphasised that both genders cooperated in forest activities. While a high level of
women’s participation in forestry programmes reﬂects valuable, gendered concerns about
sustainability and the health of the environment, it may be exploited as cheap labour, which
women are often expected to deliver in homes and communities.

MMCT comes across as surprisingly gender-blind. The MTR Team observed almost no examples
of attention to gender in the MMCT activities or documents reviewed. The following make no
references to gender relations or to men’s and women’s interests and problems:40

- Project Appraisal Document (World Bank 2001)

- Joint Mid-Term Review (FD, MMCT, and World Bank 2006)
- Project Proposal to the Norwegian government (August 2007)
- The Mid-Term Review 2008

— MMCT End of Project Report 2002-200841

- MlVlCT Strategic Plan 2008-2012

Thus, over the years it has been a common understanding between the organisation and its donors
that gender was not central. MMCT programmes are relevant for gender concerns but this often
remains invisible. An observer might easily conclude that it is irrelevant in view of Malawian,
international and Norwegian policy on gender equality and women’s rights. Surprisingly, the
Project Proposal from 2007 could be approved without addressing gender issues. Asked why this
was not brought up by the Norwegian Government, the Executive Director suggested that the
Embassy was so concerned about ‘addressing a crisis’ (of environmental degradation) and
[therefore] found that ‘adding’ a gender mainstreaming strategy and other standard elements of
programme design was not a priority. A better reading would stress that gender is not an ‘added’
concern, but central to creating a transition to participatory and sustainable resource management
and the empowerment and agency of communities and individuals that it builds upon. Thus, we
would not agree with an interpretation that a prime focus on ‘biodiversity’ precludes the need to
address gender. These are interwoven, just like the crises threatening biodiversity and natural

 

40 Human rights more generally are not addressed in the documents.

41 However this report has welcome examples of gender specific reporting, informing how many women (1 272) and
men (1 145) participate in beekeeping (Table 7) and that two men and five women are nursery managers. Gender
specific reporting is otherwise rarely seen in the documents.

62

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

resources are interwoven with other social, political and economic factors, a point we return to
below.

We discussed gender with several staff and observers, who readily discuss the issue and generally
agree that it is not a strong point of MMCT. In various discussions, the Team came across vague
arguments against gender equality concerns. For example, that ‘women (staff) are not interested
in biodiversity issues’, that ‘women are not willing to go on the mountain’ or that in the largely
matrilineal cultures of the area women enjoy considerable power over, particularly, land and
inheritance.

The Team notes that the MMCT vision is ‘to contribute towards a Mulanje Mountain Global
Biosphere that is responsibly managed and equitably benefitting all’. To ensure equitable
distribution of benefits, costs and harm, one needs to know and address the major sources of
inequity, such as power, class, gender, age, employment/position and education. Mere
participation by women in for example forest co-management is inadequate: one must consider
the labour requirements, power relations and the advantages and disadvantages women gain
through participation. The disadvantages and risks that men face as staff working in the high
mountain zone as guards, nursery workers and so on, also deserve attention. The issue should not
be reduced to one of staffing, since gender sensitive and pro-active programmes will not follow
automatically from a more gender-balanced staff. It is therefore imperative that MMCT takes
deliberate efforts in embracing gender at all level from the strategic to the practical. If
programmes do not address prioritised, gendered problems, involve men and women in effective
ways and are culturally acceptable, MMCT outcomes and impact are less likely to be sustainable.
While not every measure that is ‘correct’ from a principled gender equality point of view may be
culturally acceptable in the short term (an example might be women’s work as tourist guides), the
tension needs to be articulated, negotiated and perhaps resolved over time.

An MMCT gender strategy is a necessary element in the organisational development and will
increase the likelihood that MMCT programmes will succeed. Gender has been taken up by the
Norwegian Embassy from the first Annual Meeting in 2009, and at the Annual Meeting in
August 2010 an MMCT Board member observed the gender imbalance in the organisation and
representation. We have been informed that MMCT has started making a gender policy, although
no outcomes of this effort were communicated to the Review Team. We have, however, noted the
positive change towards more gender-balanced employment in the MOBI+LISE project and that
this project also involved a study of gender, natural resource management and livelihoods.

8.4. COMPLEXITY AND DYNAMICS OF RESOURCE GOVERNANCE AND USE

MMCT programmes are addressing a complex intersection of ecological, social and economic
factors and it maintains a fairly holistic approach. The biodiversity management knowledge and
skills of MMCT and of a partner such as FRIM is impressive. So is the international research it
has stimulated. It is important that biodiversity and ecosystem research is taken further. As we
observed on our brief trip with highly knowledgeable MMCT/FD and FRHVI staff, the Mulanje
Mountain presents very complex ecological dynamics that may to a large extent be particular to
Mulanje and theoretically challenging: issues such as forest rejuvenation, species interactions,
ﬁre ecology and the soil and vegetation aspects of maintaining the all-important hydrology of the
watershed. Nevertheless, we also find the programmes tilted in favour of biodiversity

63

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

conservation somewhat at the expense of livelihoods, economic beneﬁts, institutional and
political arrangements and other factors that affect the desired transition to long-term
sustainability or resource use. As acknowledged by the Executive Director, there are major
unresolved issues about how to move from unsustainable, often illegal, resource utilisation to
sustainable and equitable use, issues mentioned in the MMCT Research Strategy (MMCT
Research Committee 2009). A solid understanding of major trends and the causes and drivers of
forest destruction is still missing.

Social science studies have been carried out but appear weakly integrated in programme design,
as conﬁrmed by a FRHVI researcher. Resource economics would be relevant and political ecology
studies of the power dimensions of environmental governance (e. g. Robbins 2004). Water
resource issues were central to the original development objective and deserve more attention
from a research, developmental and social justice points of view. Political ecology perspectives
typically challenge ‘Malthusian’ understandings that focus on population and poverty to explain
threats to resources. In discussions an MMCT Programme Ofﬁcer (D. Nangoma) challenged the
view of ‘poverty’ as the major explanatory factor for the threats to biodiversity and, in particular,
the dramatic and continued reduction in the presence of Mulanje cedar. Most poor people,
including small-holders and tea estate workers, have little access to the high mountain zone. The
major losses of Mulanje cedar in 2007 were executed by a number of sawyers with resources and
clout, including to affect the Forest Department (to get licenses, move from the permitted dead
standing trees to live trees, extend the time period allowed etc., etc.).42 While the Team agrees, in
part, with this explanation, population also plays a role. Reported cases of encroachment into the
forest reserve have been linked to population growth and land pressure (Norad 2009: 30).
Population growth in Mulanje and Phalombe districts of an aggregate 23% and 35% over the ten-
year period from 1998 and 2008 (N80 2008) puts pressure on the small amounts of land
available to small-holder agriculture. However, political, economic and other institutional factors
are in mediating the impact of population on the environment. The issues addressed by MMCT
require an on-going critical debate and investigation by staff and partners informed by cross-
disciplinary natural and social science research.

8.5. CONFLICT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT: A MILITARIZED APPROACH?

The conﬂict level over resource extraction on Mulanje Mountain appears to be fairly high, and
has involved violent incidents in recent years, although regarded by the MMCT Executive
Director as ‘isolated’. Three cases mentioned below show how sensitive the issue of law
enforcement in the forest is.

A researcher at FRHVI recounted a case where he and an MMCT and FD team had come across
panga [machete] armed illegal loggers in the mountain. On that occasion, FD staff had to remove
their uniforms for fear of provoking violence by the loggers. Nobody in the team dared challenge
the loggers.43

 

42 D. Nangoma, MMCT - account during field trip. The Mid-Term Report 2008 states: ’Reports made available to
this mission conﬁrm the catastrophic consequence of that season with possibly 80% of the stock depleted. This may
signal the near extinction of the Malawi national tree in mature stand. In spite of the season being closed for three
months many sawyers are still on the mountain.’ (World Bank and Embassy of Norway 2008)

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

The Mulanje Police reported an incident in 2009 where it had been called out to address illegal
logging at Muloza. However, the two police ofﬁcers had been attacked with stones by
community members. Additional forces had to be sent. The police ofﬁcers had to be hospitalised
with fairly severe injuries from stoning. Arrests were later made and villagers sentenced.44

In December 2009, a tragic turn of events triggered community anger leading to riots. Again the
police and MMCT staff had confronted two illegal loggers at Fort Lister, who escaped. As one
had been recognised, the ofﬁcials proceeded to his home, where they found illegally felled
commercial timber. The police arrested the wife, who was giving conﬂicting accounts of the
sources of the timber, for further questioning. After being interrogated at the Phalombe Police
station she was released to stay with relatives. During the night she fell sick and passed away.
Information of this reached the communities the following morning. Interpreting her death to be
the consequence of abuse at the hands of the police, the community attacked and set ﬁre to forest
buildings. The Phalombe Police requested that her body was taken to a hospital for a medical
inquest. The conclusion there was that the cause of death was a prior condition (heart ailment).45
Disregarding the causal explanation of the woman’s tragic death, the response of the community
testiﬁes to a tense relation with the Forest Department and other authorities over forest.

Some partners praised MMCT for enabling effective action on law enforcement on the Mulanje
Mountain during the period under consideration, mainly together with the Forestry Department,
the Police or the National Parks & Wildlife Service, who are all empowered to carry out armed
operations. In its presentation to the MMTC Board, the MTR Team raised critical questions about
the (armed) law enforcement and asked whether MMCT was moving towards a militarized
approach. We noted that such law enforcement involve risky operations and confrontations with
armed gangs engaged in illegal exploitation, that there has been some cases where enforcement
agencies took recourse to using armed forces, and that there have been isolated incidents of
attacks on police (Muloza) and riots at the Forestry Department (Fort Lister). The MTR Team
advised that militarization of conservation is not likely to be a sustainable response to pressure on
mountain resources that there is need to develop the capacities of surrounding villages in forest

protection and that where necessary, the use of force should be in the hands of designated
bodies.’

This issue raised some debate. The major point of contention raised at the meeting (in particular
by a representative of traditional leaders in Mulanj e) was that use of armed force was necessary
to halt illegal use by gangs that are themselves armed, for example with pangas and pitsaws used
as weapons. The leader argued that there are two kinds of people in the communities: those who
listen and cooperate, and those who do not. The latter only respect the use of force.

The issue of law enforcement is obviously difﬁcult and contentious. The MTR Team ﬁnds it
central to the evaluation of the approaches used by MMTC partners and important for the success
in the coming years. We therefore seek to clarify our argument, which concerns: (i) the
philosophy of the MMBCP, (ii) the justiﬁcation for using armed force, (iii) the approach chosen,
(iv) authority and jurisdiction, and (v) the costs.

(i) The philosophy. The MMBCP project was conceived within a move away from ‘command-
and-control’ approaches to natural resources management towards ‘co-management’:

Under this approach, neighbouring communities are able to participate directly in the
management of these protected areas, including both active engagement in their protection
(e. g., community patrols and sanctions) and obtaining benefits ﬁom sustainable use of wood
and non-wood products. (World Bank 200] .' 3).

Therefore, community awareness, capacity for protection activities, and beneﬁts from
conservation and use were central. The philosophy has not been abandoned, so the use of armed
force is in most respects indicative of a failure of the main approach, particularly failing to
provide adequate economic beneﬁts. Despite having more than 500 patrolmen from the Forestry
Department, wild ﬁres, illegal extraction of Mulanje cedar and charcoal burning still continue,
suggesting failure of a militarized approach to forest management. The Team believes that the
involvement of surrounding communities in forest management is more effective than the
‘command and control’ approach. Institutional studies in Chimaliro Forest Reserve in the
central/northern region of Malawi have shown that, if properly designed, local institutions can
change human behaviour and enable cooperation in collective forestry management (see for
example Kayambazinthu 2000, Jumbe and Angelsen 2007). The Norwegian Embassy has pointed
out that the number of court cases is not a good indicator of progress but rather actual reductions
in for example illegal Mulanje cedar cutting (Minutes of Meeting 2009: 5.2).

(ii) The justification for the use of armed force. The MTR team did not argue that armed force
can in no case be justiﬁed. Where individuals or gangs use arms in illegal resource exploitation,
the situation is comparable to armed robbery, and properly authorised used of force may be
justiﬁed. However, there is a need to discuss how central this becomes and who has authority and
jurisdiction.

(iii) The approach chosen. It should be recognised that MMCT partners have made efforts to
organise ‘community policing’. The Ofﬁcer in Charge of the Mulanje police reported that they
have worked with around ﬁfty community policing forums around the mountain. However, he
also said that the work was ‘just starting’, that communities were ‘not all that vibrant’ and that
there were ‘many hick-ups’. He explained that communities did not always feel ‘free to give
information’ and were not sufﬁciently ‘motivated’: ‘People lack land and depend on the
mountain and have nowhere else to cut’. Police experience it as difﬁcult to enforce rules against
individuals trying to meet their basic needs, something communities are aware. Thus, a number
of factors hamper community-based approaches, particularly the fear of powerful individuals
involved in illegal harvesting and the fact that some depend on the forest for their livelihood.

MMCT appears to have de-emphasised community approaches to conservation. The Annual
Report 2008-2009 states that law enforcement programme ‘intensiﬁed forest patrols in the year,
involving the Department of Parks and Wildlife, the police and Forestry Department staff. There
was not much of community involvement in local policing works, especially in villages that
are involved in illegal charcoal burning in Phalombe area’ (MMCT 2009c: 3-4. Emphasis added).
No further comments are given, explaining or addressing the poor result on community
involvement. However, the section on forest co-management notes the positive impact of new
agreements on communities willingness to engage in protection of the forest (MMCT 2009c: 13).

66

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

The (draft) annual report for 2009-2010 makes no mention of community involvement in law
enforcement (MMCT 2010b: 9-11). Instead, what is highlighted is that ﬁfteen Forestry
Department have received a ‘four-week training in paramilitary operations and natural resources
management’ by the Department of Parks and National Parks Liwonde, which has earlier been
criticised for gross human rights abuses (Neumann 2004). This case is again cited in recent
literature on the increasing use of armed force in conservation in Africa (Duffy 2010: 82-83). The
draft Annual Report 2009-2010 also informs that MMCT has taken initiatives to involve the
Malawi Armed Forces in forest protection (MMCT 2010b: 10). MMCT reported to the 2010
Annual Meeting that ‘things were getting out of hand’ in the form of resistance from illegal
harvesters and Forestry Department’s lack of mandate to ‘punish culprits’. MMCT’s Director
stressed the need for forestry department patrolmen to be armed (Minutes of Meeting 2010:
5.1.3). The Work Programme for 2010—2011 makes provision for paying soldier allowances from
Norwegian project support. Training in ’paramilitary operations’ and involvement of the army in
forest protection are certainly indicators of a militarization of the approach.

The MTR Team ﬁnds the use of the army in a civil business of natural resource management to
be problematic in a democratic society. There is good reason to warn against a further
militarization of resource management, as a representative of the Norwegian donor did when she
exclaimed: ‘We do not want to create another Kosovo here’ (quoted by an MMCT staff). While
that comparison may be far-fetched, it expresses the sense of a high level of conﬂict and the
sensitive nature of armed approaches in conservation (another donor had also rejected funding
ﬁre arms).

Discussion with MMCT staff showed a sense of admiration and empowerment through the
National Parks & Wildlife armed approach. Some MMCT staff argued that they would like to be
able to bring arms, particularly riﬂes, during ﬁeld operations.46 They pointed out that they would
not shoot at people involved in illegal activities, only shoot in the air to disperse illegal loggers.
The MTR Team also observed that patrols were moving in the mountain, men hired from various
communities by the Forestry Department with funding from MMCT. They carried radios and
pangas. One may look at it as an intermediate form of patrolling, both in terms of involvement
and arming, but it is not the same as community-led protection, and much more costly. The MTR
team ﬁnds that the positive results of forest co-management in increasing community protection
and development (reported in Mbewa and Chanasa villages) could not have been achieved with a
militarized approach adopted under law enforcement.47

 

46 The MMCT office possessed only one defunct Iifﬂe at the time of field visits.
47 Community protection of forest was mentioned neither under “law-enforcement’ nor under “forest co-
management’ in the draft MMCT Annual Report 2009—2010.

(iv) Who has authority and jurisdiction? In carrying out law enforcement activities, MIVICT has
relied on cooperation with FD and the police in a manner that is generally appreciated by these
organisations, particularly since MMCT contributes the needed resources for the operations. We
question the view that law enforcement can be an activity of an organisation with MMCT’s
status. In response to our question, the Officer in Charge of the Mulanje Police also stated
emphatically that,

Law enforcement is totally in our hands; that cannot be done by WC T.

In his view, MMCT’s law enforcement role should rely on funding other actors (police, FD) and
on supporting communities. However, MMCT has made ‘law enforcement’ one of eight
prioritised activity areas in the Strategy Plan 2008-2012. The description of the strategy does not
clarify the roles of other agencies:

Law enforcement: Under this strategic area, WC T will mobilize its ejforts towards reducing
illegal harvesting and use of mountain resources. In a broader sense, WC T will engage in
both mountain enforcement and off mountain enforcement. This will be done through
community policing, partner sensitization and capacity building. WC T will facilitate the
process and ensure that all necessary activities are done. (NM/[C T 2008b: [0)

While a generous reading will see the MMCT role as facilitator, funder and coordinator, a more
critical eye will see that the boundaries of jurisdiction and authority are blurred. MMCT should
not, in the Team’s view, engage in ‘enforcement’ and cannot take the responsibility that ‘all
necessary activities are done’.48 The MTR Team ﬁnds that MMCT should be cautious about
mixing roles. Since the police and the Forestry Department have the public authority and are
accountable for the actions and results, their strong dependency on MMCT for their ability to
respond to crime related to the mountain is already an accountability problem. In a similar
manner, it might be better to talk about community involvement in forest protection rather than
‘community policing’, since that term too blurs the boundary between state and non-state actors
and responsibilities.

 

48 In fact, the Planning Matn'x identifies only the Forestry Department as the responsible agency.
68

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

(V) The costs. According to the Annual Workplan, the budget for law enforcement was
US$80,000 in 2009-2010, out of which US$60,000 (75%) from the Norwegian support and
US$20, 000 from USAID (MlVICT 2009b: 11). In the Annual Workplan 2010-2011, the budget is
increased by 18% over the previous year, to US$94,000.49 The main expenditure here is daily
allowances for staff from Forestry Department, Department of National Parks and Wildlife and/or
the Malawi Defence Force, and the police (MK8.320 million, US$55,000, or 59% of the cost of
law enforcement). The daily allowances range between US$13 and US$60 per day.50

The Programme Officer at the Norwegian Embassy expressed to the MTR Team that the
Embassy was concerned about the high costs of law enforcement and that, according to his
memory, MMCT had been asked to reduce these costs at the 2010 Annual Meeting.

The Team also observes that a day’s allowance for a National Park guard or a member of the
Defence Force (MK9 000) is equivalent to the salary of a forestry worker for 30 days (at MK300
per day).51 The main project document for MMBCP (World Bank 2001) discusses employment
generation as one of the beneﬁts to communities that would contribute to a positive relationship
with the project and forest conservation, and it seems reasonable to weigh the expenditure for law
enforcement by armed specialists against such employment. The increased emphasis and
expenditure on law enforcement, and the move of the livelihoods programme to the USAID
funded MOBI+LISE project, means that Norwegian funds shift away from community-based
towards a more highhanded fortress-conservation approach, which is not only questionable in
itself but also unsustainable without a foreign donor to cover the costs.

8.6. ILLEGAL FOREST UTILISATION AND EXCLUSION FROM FOREST MANAGEMENT

The owners of Thuchila Estate have carried out a well-documented case of illegal possession of
Mulanje cedar in which the relevant authorities (District and Regional Forest Ofﬁce and the
police) were overturned through political dictate, setting aside the applicable rules (MMCT
2009a), and section 0. The legitimate actors have not been able to make any progress on the
matter. In the co-forest management case, three communities have been unable to access the
forest and exercise the rights that they hold under agreements with the Malawian Government
signed in 2008. This is at least partly related to the issuing by the Forest Department of a tourism
licence to the Thuchila Estate, which allegedly fails to recognise the rights of communities who
entered co-management agreements. MMCT’s programmes and multi-stakeholder organisation
are thus threatened by political abuse of power for private gain, in contravention of the intentions
and contents of co-management agreements entered between the Government of Malawi, MMCT
and three communities in Phalombe during the first phase of Norwegian funding.

The Team observes that these cases present a major threat to the attainment of project objectives,
not merely because of the gravity of the offences themselves but because the indications of high

 

49 Since the USAID support is now dealt with in a separate budget and account, it is assumed that the funding for law
enforcement is now in its entirety from the Norwegian support, which therefore increases by about 56% from

US$60 000 in 2009-2010.

50 The daily allowances to be provided for law enforcement operations are MK9,000 (US$60) for National Park staff
or members of the Malawi Defence Force, MK7,000 (US$ 47) for Forestry Department staff and MKZ 000 (US$13)
for police ofﬁcers (MMCT 2010a: 11-12).

31 Forest nursery workers funded by MMCT and interviewed on Mulanje Mountain indicated this salary level.

69

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

level political protection threatens the integrity of the MMCT partnership. The cases have the
potential to undermine the co-management agreements that are so central to the involvement of
communities in conservation and utilisation of Mulanje Forest resources. It will be difﬁcult to
extend the co-forest management programme with credibility if MMCT and communities are
aware that agreements can be overruled by private interests at any point in time. The cases may
also give a perception that the authorities are unable or unwilling to enforce the applicable
forestry rules, such as about encroachment and timber extraction, to all actors.

Unlike the other challenges, this one is not within the control of MMCT as an organisation, and it
is even difﬁcult to address by the MMCT as a multi-stakeholder forum and actor with high level
government representation. Concerning the issuing of a tourism licence, the Forestry Department
representative informed the MMCT Board meeting on 23 September 2010 that a task force inside
the Department is investigating the matter. The representative conﬁrmed that a mistake had been
made by the Department. The matter has already lingered for some time and it is necessary to
ﬁnd a resolution, particularly to ensure communities’ access to their co-management forest
blocks. The Team is of the opinion that if the matter is not resolved within the current programme
year, that is, by June 2011, the co-forest management programme should be discontinued in the
MMCT programme area.

9. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.1. CONCLUSIONS

9.1.1. The Mid-term Review 2010

This Mid-term Review was carried out on behalf of the Norwegian Government in order to
review progress and suggest measures of corrective action concerning the implementation of the
Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Programme implemented by MMCT and its
partners. The MMBCP receives support from the Norwegian Government covering the period
2008-2012 to a value of NOK20.5 million (about MK640 million). The review is based on
consultations with a range of individuals, visits to selected villages and sites on the Mulanje
Mountain, and review of project document and other available sources of information. This work
was primarily carried out during 13 to 24 September 2010 followed by a period for analysis and
write-up of ﬁndings.

9.1.2. Overall assessment

Since its inception the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has contributed strongly to funding,
innovative collaboration, research, conservation, environmental awareness and other
contributions to the conservation of biodiversity and other natural resources on Mulanje
Mountain, a unique mountain landscape in Malawi and southern Africa which has received
global recognition. MMCT has built a small but unique and competent organisation with a
disproportionate impact on the visibility of natural resource and environmental values and issues
of Mulanje Mountain. A major achievement of MMCT is its innovation and creativity in bringing
together and supporting a considerable number of actors.

The programmes are of high relevance for current Malawian and Norwegian development
policies. This concerns, ﬁrst of all, the conservation and use of natural resources including
biodiversity. The project aims to contribute to fulﬁlling Malawi’s obligations under the
Convention on Biological Diversity and in other ways protect the signiﬁcance of the Mulanje
Mountain, which has been expressed in multiple manners (as Forest Reserve, Global Man and
Biosphere Reserve and in the expected declaration as a World Heritage Site. The project is also
relevant for the Norwegian Government’s interests in adaptation to climate change, which is
reﬂected in its support to the Lake Chilwa Basin climate change adaptation project and its
guidelines for future support to Bunda College. The MMBCP is also relevant for strengthening
livelihoods and reducing poverty and thereby several of the Millennium Development Goals and
the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy. However, poverty and livelihood goals are rather
indirect and instrumental of the main focus on biodiversity conservation. The lack of attention to
gender issues detracts from the project’s policy relevance.

In general the MTR Team ﬁnds that the decision to support the Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity
Conservation Project is justiﬁed.

9.1.3. Generally adequate progress towards reaching project objectives

During the period reviewed (2008-2010), MMCT has maintained and further developed central
programme activities and collaborative arrangements. MMCT has made acceptable progress
towards attaining programme objectives, although progress is uneven and the outcomes and

71

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

impact rarely well documented. With regard to the ﬁve objectives in the agreement concerning
Norwegian support, the MTR Team makes the following observations:

Objective 1: Maintain Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, including globally significant
biodiversity and vital ecological services. MMCT and partners, particularly the Forest
Department, are carrying out a range of important conservation activities. These include: removal
of invasive alien species, maintenance and construction of ﬁrebreaks and other ﬁre prevention
activities, rejuvenation of indigenous forest with emphasis on the endemic Mulanje cedar, which
is of high biodiversity, commercial and symbolic value, and law enforcement. Satisfactory
progress has been made with regard to programme activities and outputs. However, in some
respects the effectiveness of the interventions in achieving the desired impact (such as of ﬁre
protection, removal invasive species) is hard to ascertain. Again, the tendencies towards a
militarization of law enforcement are not only expensive and unsustainable, but contradict efforts
in embracing community participation in forest management.

Objective 2: Increase awareness, understanding and appreciation of the value of the
Mulanje Mountain ecosystem at local and national levels. MMCT and partners have rolled out
a diverse and intense information and education campaign and MMCT is highly visible in the
area, and has promoted the recognition of Mount Mulanje including as a tourist destination. The
resource use and proliﬁc activity under this component may appear too high compared to the
wider programme. In particular, the Review Team ﬁnds that the information campaigns appear
delinked from materially important efforts in conservation, livelihoods and co-management. The
Team did not feel convinced that there was a genuine effort to learn from communities, to
embrace or negotiate with their values and knowledge of the mountain or to contribute to
behavioural change and conﬂict resolution among different stakeholders.

Objective 3: Improve sustainability of biological resource use and enhance the value of the
Mulanje Mountain ecosystem to local communities.

Forest co-management is a central programme that corresponds to one of the main development
objectives and has basis in the Forest Policy of Malawi (1996) and the Forest Act (1997). The
project was slow in taking off due to lack of understanding between MMCT and government
forestry ofﬁcials, and progress continues to be unsatisfactory. By March 2008, only six forest co-
management agreements had been signed and another two prepared. The MTR Team observed
that residents who have functional agreement enjoyed rights to collection of ﬁre wood, thatch
grass and beekeeping. Residents, MMCT and FD conﬁrmed that illegal use of the forest had gone
down and that communities were more active in forest protection and development. A number of
problems have been observed, however.

The overarching issue is the exclusion of forest users by the politically inﬂuential Mulli Brothers
who own Thuchila Estate in Phalombe district. Since 2009, villagers from Chanasa, Makolera
and Punduma, who signed a forest co-management agreement in 2008, have been threatened with
arms and hindered from accessing their land except on occasion against payment of fees to the
estate owners. As such, the villagers are neither able to exercise their rights nor carry out
management and protection activities and it is reported that the forest is in a deteriorating state
due to illegal harvesting and an increased number of ﬁres. Inability to resolve the conﬂict
seriously compromises MMCT partners and if unresolved will make it untenable to extend the

72

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 ll/Iid-Term Review

co-forest management programme to other parts of the Mulanje Mountain area, and even raise
questions about the justiﬁcation for continued funding.

Other, mainly agriculture based, livelihoods are supported through a wide range of activities in
villages in the Mulanje Mountain area. These contribute to the incomes and security of many
individuals and households but the impact at village and higher levels is poorly documented. The
Team has the impression that the programme needs serious up-scaling. Complementary
interventions on marketing and entrepreneurship are needed for the communities to beneﬁt fully
from the livelihood interventions. This is now planned through a USAID funded programme,
which will enable MMCT to re-allocate Norwegian funds earmarked for livelihood activities to
other programmes. The extent to which the USAID livelihood project will be linked to
sustainable natural resource management is unclear. The Team suggests that livelihood
interventions should be used as an incentive for cooperation in participatory forest management.
There is a general need to increase, and document, the economic beneﬁts to communities and
individuals of all interventions, whether in conservation, forestry management or farming.

Objective 4: Establish long-term income stream and institutional capacity to ensure
continuation of the above first objectives. The MMCT core ofﬁce in Mulanje has a small,
competent and dynamic leader and staff who often go beyond the call of duty to carry out the
programmes of the organisation. Several observers expressed admiration for the organisation for
its performance and creativity. The Review Team notes that the programmes are demanding and
growing in geographical coverage and, sometimes, complexity the agency and willingness to take
responsibility of the staff need to be nurtured with excellent working conditions.

A major achievement of MMCT is to attract international donor funding for a range of activities
and partners. The Norwegian funding has contributed directly to a number of partners and
indirectly through enhancing the credibility and leverage of MMCT network. MMCT gets credit
from these partners for being creative and ﬂexible in supporting capacity building. While the
multi-stakeholder network approach creates the capacity of MMCT, it also entails dependence on
the commitment and capacity of those partners.

MMCT has proposed the creation of Private Public Partnership (PPP) to improve the autonomy,
sustainability and efﬁciency of MMCT. The Department of Forestry has several concerns about
the proposed PPP, particularly concerning the degree of control over the Mulanje Forest Reserve
and incomes generated from it and, at any rate, actors are awaiting the completion of a national
policy process concerning PPPs. Central to the plans for a PPP was the ambition to improve local
retention of revenues raised from the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve. The MTR has not noted
major developments in this regard and there is a risk that delays concerning the PPP are used to
justify slow progress. Again, the Team observes that major decisions concerning the resource use
and management of the Mulanje Mountain (issuance of concessions permits for Cedar extraction
etc.) may disempower local forestry staff and MMCT.

Objective 5: Demonstrate the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as a financing
mechanism for biodiversity conservation. From April 2005 MMCT has held in trust an
endowment fund of US$545 million on behalf of the Malawian people. The project proposal to
the Norwegian Government expected the fund to reach US$83 million by 2012, on the
assumption of a 7.5% rate of return. Withdrawing 5.5% would then yield US$450,000 per year

73

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

for operations from 2012-2013. Due in part to ﬁnancial instability the growth of the fund has
been considerably less. By September 2010, the fund had grown to US$62 million. The MTR
ﬁnds that while fund management appears to have been good, the persistent problem of a high
inﬂation level in Malawi undermining asset and yield growth appears to have been
underestimated. From 2005 to 2009 average inﬂation in Malawi has been about 10% and average
depreciation against the US dollar about 5% per year so that the purchase power of the fund is
steadily undermined by an effective inﬂation of about 5% per year. High inﬂation still poses a
major challenge to making the endowment fund the source of an adequate and sustainable
funding stream.

The MTR Team agrees that there is a need to secure rapid injections in the endowment fund and
that a substantially higher total endowment is required based on more cautious assessments of the
effective annual yield. The Team examined the impact of various levels of endowment fund
injections under different assumptions about inﬂation, exchange rate and annual withdrawals.
More cautious assumptions than those so far used are warranted. It appears more realistic to
expect between 2% and 3% effective annual yield, which means that a substantially higher
principal is required, probably in the order of US$25 to 35 million. MMTC needs to explore the
possibilities for obtaining contributions to the fund with a range of donors, including Norway,
which has recently committed funding to environmental funds in Brazil and the Congo.

9.1.4. Major challenges

Despite fair progress in achieving objectives, the MMCT network faces a number of serious
challenges that should be addressed in order to achieve goals and prepare for, and justify, support
in a new phase following 2012. Among the challenges, the MTR has focused on the following:
WC T -Forest Department relations and cooperation. These have has improved substantially in
the current phase, although problems remain. There is still a perception in the DFOs that joint
planning is not genuine, because MMCT control of resources and tendency to dictate the frame,
take decisions and in some cases abandon jointly made plans. The MTR Team is also concerned
about inadequate government funding to the Forest Departments at district level for operations,
which underpins a dependency on MMCT.

Gender relations and gender equality. Gender relations and equality impinge deeply on the issues
studied, for example, women are disproportionately affected by the increased workload of poor
access to ﬁre wood and drinking water, high women’s participation in forestry programmes may
reﬂect valuable gendered concerns about sustainability and the health of the environment, but can
also be exploited as cheap labour. Discrimination against women in certain forms of decision-
making, such as in professional organisations, traditional leadership institutions is fairly
widespread. The Team observed no examples of attention to gender issues in the documents or
activities reviewed, including the approved Proposal Document 2007, up until the Annual
Meetings with Norway from 2009. Norwegian gender policy stresses political and economic
participation, rights to health and protection against violence. Gender is not an ‘added’ concern
but central to the community and individual agency and empowerment that is inherent in
participatory and sustainable resource management. The MMCT Board is aware of the skewed
gender balance of staff and within Board membership and has launched a gender strategy,
although no manifestations of this process were communicated to the MTR Team. Gender
equality has been neglected at all levels and need to be addressed through completing the gender

74

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 lVIid-Term Review

strategy, making a visible move towards gender equality in staffing, and through pro-active,
gender-aware programming, operations and reporting.

Complexity and unresolved dynamics of resource governance and depletion. MlVlCT
programmes are addressing a complex intersection of ecological, social and economic factors and
maintain a diverse and holistic approach. The biodiversity knowledge and skills of MMCT and
the national and international research it has stimulated, is impressive. The MTR Team
nevertheless finds that while social science studies have been carried out they appear weakly
integrated in programme design. As acknowledged by the Executive Director, there are major
unresolved issues about how to move from unsustainable, often illegal, resource utilisation to
sustainable use. Water and land governance and distribution are important issues that affect the
impact of programmes. Resource economics and political ecology are ﬁelds that would relevant
in further work. Knowledge of social differentiation within and among communities and actors
involved in the use of Mulanje Mountain is needed, among other to realise the MMCT mission of
ensuring that the beneﬁts and costs of conservation and use are distributed equitably.

Conflict and law enforcement. The conﬂict level over resource extraction on Mulanje Mountain
is fairly high and has involved a number of violent incidents in the period considered. MMCT on
a number of occasions called upon the armed staff of the police and national parks authorities to
arrest illegal loggers and charcoal producers. MMCT also reports that it is sending its own and
forestry department staff for para-military training. A number of staff expressed their desire to
carry arms during field operations. Current plans for the use of Norwegian funding include the
use of the Malawi Defence Forces in forest protection, which appears inappropriate in a
democratic society. There is good reason to warn against a further militarization of resource
management.

Addressing the abuse of power through illegal harvesting of Mulanje timber and the exclusion of
villagers ﬁom co-management forest land. The Team is particularly concerned about threats to
the forest co-management programme caused by the exclusion of communities from access to the
forest to which they have obtained legal rights. The abuse of power by the owners of Thuchila
Estate, threatening residents with arms, hindering them from accessing the forest for rightful
utilisation and forest protection, and privately charging villagers fees for the use of public
property, has persisted for too long. It also contravenes the intentions and contents of co-
management agreements entered between the Government of Malawi, MMCT and the three
communities during the first phase of Norwegian funding. This requires urgent follow up if the
positive achievements also dealt with in this report are to be sustained.

9.2. RECOMMENDATIONS

9.2.1. Take stock and look ahead: learning and strategic planning

Based on the importance of the issues addressed, the valuable contribution of creating the MMCT
multi-stakeholder organisation and the commendable achievements in conservation, research and
livelihoods development among others, the MTR Team would like to see MMCT programmes
improve, grow and succeed.

75

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 lVIid-Term Review

In the coming two years this will require continuation of good and hard efforts by the highly
committed staff, by the diverse partners and by the broad public and non-governmental alliance
of the MMCT Board. It will require some changes and new areas of strategic emphasis. It will
also require a major investment in strategic planning, programme development and efforts to
ensure that funding is secured on a sustainable basis. The MTR Team’s recommendations
therefore have a double edge: they concern action to be taken to improve performance during the
remaining two years of the current project; and they concern planning for the future, while
drawing on the experience gained.

MMCT needs to build on its ﬂexible and dynamic action capabilities to create a critical learning
approach where experience is systematically evaluated, reﬂected upon and used in strategic
planning and action. MMCT needs to put the layer of old project documents behind it and
develop consensus and shared, multi-stakeholder ownership around a new strategy and
programme proposal for the period beyond 2012. The MTR Team recommends that within the
coming year the planning initiated with the Strategic Plan 2008-2012 is taken further. This
document identiﬁes strategic areas and objectives in a useful way but needs to be made clearer
and more elaborate. This effort would also include substantially strengthening the monitoring and
evaluation system. The risk assessment and risk management strategies should be reviewed and
updated. Before 2012, a revised strategy and programme proposal should be available. It should
express MMCT multi-stakeholder consensus and ownership and should document capability of
addressing the major challenges and risks, including those raised by this review.

9.2.2. Maintain progress in reaching the objectives

Biodiversity conservation, monitoring and research. Continue important and demanding work
with more attention to sustainable utilisation, monitoring of impact and research on other species
that can be grown.

Environmental education and awareness. We recommend integrating the diverse activities in this
component more closely with other programme activities and to ensure that environmental
education and communication is part of a mutual learning process whereby MMCT and partners
become increasingly aware of the values, knowledge and capabilities of community members and
groups.

Forest management and livelihoods. As per targets, the Forest Co-management programme needs
to be extended to larger areas, which in turn requires that issues of collaboration, capacity and
implementation are resolved. A case of conﬂict concerning communities in Phalombe requires
urgent resolution to justify further extension of the programme and avoid that the MMCT
partnership is jeopardised (it is addressed below as a major challenge). There is need for
integrated approach to livelihoods programmes that are linked to forest co-management and to
value chains and marketing.

Capacity building and income streams. MMCT should continue to be innovative in developing
the capacities of local partners and should increase the efforts to identify, together with them,
income streams that can be channelled into conservation and livelihoods activities and provide
for sustainability of partners and partnerships. The reported new possibilities for the Forestry
Department at district level to retain revenues for reinvestment in management and conservation
activities should be pursued.

76

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

The MMTC Board should discuss the further development of its proposal for a Public Private
Partnership in order to be prepared for the situation when a policy framework is in place. In the
meantime, the absence of a formal PPP should not be used as an excuse for not identifying
income streams that can contribute to financial sustainability. The MTR Team finds that in a
decentralized governance perspective, the involvement of District Commissioners, District
Council and various ofﬁcials should be strengthened, with or without a new Public Private
Partnership agreement.

MMCT should consider the pressure of demanding programmes on its core staff and carry out a
review of the organisation, core function analysis, lines of communication, responsibilities and
remuneration, taking into account the changes brought by new projects, increased geographical
coverage and high complexity of programmes. It should also review and revise its guidelines for
manual labour employment, including the use of contracts, wages, other remuneration and
housing. MMCT should be an equal opportunity employer that provides good conditions of
employment including a living wage for all staff it employs or funds.

9.2.3. Address challenges

MMCT needs to continuously address challenges that emanate from the highly complex,
dynamic and contested issues and on which it is working. The MTR Team has suggested the
following major challenges.

Improve relations and joint planning processes with the Forestry Department. Under the
supervision of the MMCT Board, the programme staff in MMCT and the Forest Department
should take steps to make their joint planning more equal, transparent and mutually binding as a
basis for improved and more cooperative implementation.

Gender. MMCT urgently needs to complete the process of making a gender strategy and to
include female staff in senior programme and management functions, the gender strategy should
also review and suggest measures to promote gender equality and solve gender specific needs and
problems in all its operations.

Research: MMCT should maintain its excellent networking and cooperation with reputed
international research institutions. The Mulanje mountain environment offers opportunities for
studying biological and other effects of climate change, historically and today. MMCT should
consider developing new national and international institutional collaboration for graduate
students and researchers, both strengthening existing ecological work and developing, for
example, resource economics, gender, social, and political ecology studies with relevance for
resource governance and development in the Mulanje Mountain watershed. Knowledge of social
differentiation within and among communities and actors involved in the use of Mulanje
Mountain is needed, among other to realise the MMCT mission of ensuring that the beneﬁts and
costs of conservation and use are distributed equitably. The Team recommends that MMCT
recruits a social scientist to coordinate and carry out social science research to complement on-
going natural science studies.

Law enforcement and conﬂict management. MlVICT should clarify its role in law enforcement

and the use of armed force, which may contradict the efforts to develop co-management
arrangements with communities. Militarization of conservation is not likely to be a sustainable

77

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

response to pressure on mountain resources. There is a need to develop the beneﬁts of
surrounding communities from involvement in forest protection and their capacities to exercise
forest protection. Where necessary, the use of armed force should be in the hands of designated
bodies only. The apparent shift towards utilising an increased share of the Norwegian project
funding for armed response measures through such designated bodies should not be encouraged.

Addressing the abuse of power: Illegal forest utilisation and exclusion of Phalombe communities
from co-management of forest land are major threats to the achievements of the project
objectives and appears to be in breach of the 2007 agreement with the Norwegian Government
and MMCT concerning support to MMBCP, which requires that the Malawian Government
cooperates fully to ensure that project goals are achieved and ‘to take rapid legal action to stop,
investigate and prosecute in accordance with applicable law any person suspected of misuse of
resources or corruption’ (Article 11, clause 1). If the issue remains unresolved, the MTR Team
recommends that that the forest co-management programme in the Mulanje Mountain area is
discontinued from July 2011. The Team also recommends that the Norwegian Government
carefully reviews the progress with regard to these two cases of apparent breach of the law before
committing funding for the next ﬁnancial year (2011-2012). The primary — and urgent — need is
that villagers get access to the forest land to which they were solemnly granted rights through the
ﬁrst Forest Co-management Agreements facilitated under the MMBCP project and signed by the
Malawian Government and the communities concerned on 25 March 2008.

9.2.4. The way forward
Provided that challenges are addressed in a convincing manner, MMCT should get further
support to carry out its mission which is long-term in nature.

The endowment fund While MMCT has been successful in attracting diverse donor funding, we
have sympathy for the original idea of building an endowment fund that can be the source of
funding for, at least, core costs and key conservation, research and livelihoods programmes.
Since the assumptions underlying the size of the initial (and current) endowment seriously under-
estimated the effect of high inﬂation as well as market and currency risk, there is a need to
increase the fund, probably to ﬁve or six times its current level. MMCT therefore needs to
vigorously pursue opportunities to increase the endowment fund to the desired level, including
with the Norwegian Government, which has recently changed its general practices concerning
support to foreign environmental conservation funds.

Norwegian Government support. In the current phase, the Team recommends that the Norwegian
government carefully reviews progress in resolving conﬂict over illegal utilisation of Mulanje
cedar and illegal exclusion of communities from forest co-management land, before the
commitment for 2011-2012 is made. Subject to good performance, improved documentation of
impact and success in addressing major challenges, the MTR Team 2010 recommends that the
Norwegian Government extends its support into a new ﬁve-year phase.

The Team further advises that support in this new phase be given as a combination programme
funding and one or more injections into the MMCT endowment fund aimed at bringing it to a
level where the sustainable yield can fund core functions and essential programmes. A ﬁrm
commitment concerning the total level of the grant to the endowment fund will give MMCT
predictability, while annual, performance based injections into the endowment fund could reserve

78

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

with the Norwegian Government a satisfactory measure of control aimed to ensure that the
direction, relevance and impact of MMCT programmes is satisfactory. The level of capitalisation
of the endowment fund required is so great that MMCT and/or the Norwegian Government
should pursue opportunities for pooling funding from several donors, possibly using an early,
positive commitment by Norway as leverage.

Malawian Government support. The Government of Malawi, through its central funding
allocations and through the Forest Department, should take a much stronger role in conserving
and developing natural resources and unique environmental, touristic and cultural qualities of
Mulanje Mountain and should recognise and reinforce the unique contribution that the MMCT-
led multi-stakeholder network is making towards these objectives. The Government ought to
increase support to public agencies tasked to work with the protection of the Mulanje Mountain,
and the MMCT network, and the MMCT Board should seek to inﬂuence policies and decisions to
promote such support. In a decentralized governance perspective, the involvement of District
Commissioners, District Council and various ofﬁcials should be strengthened.

9.2.5. In conclusion

Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust as a broad, multi-stakeholder forum and actor represents
high level governmental and public commitment to promote sustainable development in the
Mulanje Mountain watershed. It is probably the best opportunity that exists to conserve and
enhance biodiversity and other natural resources on Mulanje Mountain while using them to
equitably benefit of surrounding communities. There are major challenges, including problematic
aspects of the chosen conservation approach and power abuse, which MMCT needs to address in
order to justify continued support. If MMCT can seriously address these challenges during the
completion of the current phase and through its strategic planning and programme development
for a new phase, increased support will be justified. Such support should be aimed to build the
endowment fund to an adequate level and should be granted at the substantially higher levels
required by the environmental, livelihoods and socio-economic challenges in the Mulanje
Mountain watershed.

Date: 31 August 2010

Norwegian Support Code: MWI—07/0 l 0

 

2.1

Introduction

The prominent Mount Mulanje lies alongside the Mozambican frontier in the south-eastern
corner of Malawi. The mountain rises to over 3000 metres above sea level and covers an
area of 650 km2 across the two administrative districts of Mulanje and Phalombe. It has
maintained the protected area status of Forest Reserve since 1927. The Department of
Forestry is the mandated government agency responsible for the professional management
of the mountain resources and environment.

The Mulanje Mountain offers a signiﬁcant watershed, unique genetic resources, varied
livelihood requirements and an attractive tourism destination. The mountain is surrounded
by a high population and the local density is estimated to be over 200 people/kmz. The
mountain therefore is of great economic importance to the surrounding population and
hence requires careful consideration to enable a sustainable resource use regime.

Management of the Forest Reserve by the Department of Forestry follows the guidance of a
prevailing management plan which is developed within the context of existing forestry
The department has a number of ofﬁces around the
mountain to support activities, and a number of forestry staff are based at village level in
order to regulate resource use.

policy, legislation and procedures.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project

Background

The Government of Malawi (GoM), with support from the World Bank through the GEF
trust fund, has been implementing the Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project
(MMBCP). The objective of MMBCP is to improve the management of the Mulanje
Mountain Forest Reserve through three main components: Biodiversity conservation,
research and monitoring, Forest co-management and sustainable livelihoods, and

84

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

Environmental education and communication. Implementation is done by the Mulanje
Mountain Conservation Trust (MMCT).

Malawi's main development objectives for the Mulanje massif is to maintain the vital

watershed (headwater for nine rivers) and to beneﬁt local communities by establishing

sustainable management of the natural resources vital to Malawi’s economic growth and
environmental protection through cooperation between the Forest Department, local
authorities and communities. Speciﬁc objectives of the MMCBP include:

Maintain Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, including globally signiﬁcant biodiversity
and vital ecological services,

Increase awareness, understanding and appreciation of the value of the Mulanje
Mountain ecosystem, at local and national levels,

Improve sustainability of biological resource use and enhance the value of the
Mulanje Mountain ecosystem to local communities,

Establish long-term income stream and institutional capacity to ensure continuation of
the above ﬁrst objectives,

Demonstrate the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as ﬁnancing mechanism
for biodiversity conservation.

Progress toward these objectives is being measured and monitored in terms of :

increased awareness, understanding and appreciation of the importance of
environmental management in general, and of biodiversity conservation in particular,
particularly within FD and among local communities,

reversal of the trend of degradation and loss of globally signiﬁcant biodiversity in the
Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, determined through ecological/biodiversity monitoring
program,

contribution to the implementation of the Reserve Management Plan, focusing on the
biodiversity conservation aspects,

a decrease in the incidence and levels of activities and events which represent
important threats to the area's biodiversity,

implementation of speciﬁc conservation actions (e.g. ﬁrebreak maintenance, removal
of invasive exotic vegetation), carried out to the extent possible by local communities,
participation by local communities in co-management of the Forest Reserve, and
implementation and success of co-management pilot projects,

successful establishment and use of a Trust Fund to support conservation activities
over the long term, with effective participation of key stakeholders and a positive
reputation at local, national and international levels, and

success in raising funds to increase the endowment and/or operational resources of the
MlVICT.

The project is currently being implemented by Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust.

MMCT was established in 2000 under the Trustee Incorporation Act to manage a Trust

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

Fund for conservation of Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve (MMFR). Since July 2005, the
MMCT has functioned based on withdrawal from the endowment fund. The withdrawals
estimated at USD 250,000 per annum were only sufficient to financially support a limited
number of activities. It was envisaged that the endowment fund can generate enough
income to finance core MMCT activities if the capital was increased to USD 8 million. It
was estimated that a minimum of four years would be required to grow the endowment to
the level enough to generate adequate income to finance all activities at the level needed.
On this basis the Norwegian Embassy decided to support MMCT’s core activities. The
support to MMCT was therefore provided in two phases; NOK 4,500,000 to cover the
inception phase (2007-08) and NOK 20,500,000 to cover the implementation phase (2008-
20012)

Purpose of the Mid-Term Review

The purpose of the Mid-Term Review is to provide an objective assessment of the project,
its implementation in relation to the project goal, objectives and expected outputs.

Issues to be addressed by the Mid-Term Review

The mid-term review shall assess overall performance of the project in relation to the goal,
objective and expected outputs under each of the three components especially focusing on
the following:

0 To assess the performance and effectiveness of MMCT in the implementation of

biodiversity conservation activities as mandated by the objectives of the MMBCP,

To assess the mechanisms for the sustainable ﬁnancing of MMFR management,

Assess linkages and cooperation with partners, public and private,

Assess constraints faced and measures taken to address them,

Assess the possibilities and limitations in integrating with national programmes such as

ASWAp and NAPA

0 Recommend possible changes that may be required in both design and implementation
for MMBCP to better attain its development objectives.

Speciﬁc TORs for each component

The overall TORs for the MTR are to take stock of the progress of biodiversity
management activities with a focus on reviewing the design and implementation of the
project, including the analysis of the institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities,
risks, revision/refining of progress indicators, management and growth of the endowment.

i)Biodiversity, research and monitoring component: The team shall assess the key
performance indicators (both on output and outcome level) and specifically emphasize
on:

86

iii)

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

0 Eradication of invasive alien plants. Invasive alien species are threatening the
indigenous plants and animals. The team shall assess progress made in this
regard.

0 Fire prevention. Fire is the most natural destructive force that has contributed
to the environmental degradation of the mountain ecosystem. The management
authority has put in place an extensive f1rebreak network that prevents the
extensive spread of fire across the mountain. The Team will assess the extent
to which current ﬁre regimes have contributed to reduced ﬁre incidences and
improved ecosystems services on the mountain.

0 Reduced encroachment. Surrounding communities rely on mountain
resources for a living. This coupled with poverty and low income base has
forced communities to encroach into the reserve for cultivation, settlement,
illegal harvesting of mountain resources and poaching. To contain the situation,
the programme put in place law enforcement measures. The team will assess
how law enforcement and livelihood development has contributed to reduced
encroachment and illegal elements.

0 Restoration of degraded ecosystems. The clearance of pine plantations and
the chance to expand existing indigenous forest patches creates the opportunity
for the replanting of endemic tree species such as Mulanje cedar upon the
mountain heights. This is crucial to securing and expanding those unique high
altitude habitats where the endemic biodiversity is threatened. The Team will
assess progress made in this regards.

Co-management and sustainable livelihoods component: The team shall assess the
extent to which the key output and outcome indicators have been achieved, focusing
mainly on:

Forest co-management arrangements,

Community participation in law enforcement,

Conﬂicts resolution and management,

Natural resources-based enterprises promotion and development,

Forest resources regeneration and management.

Environmental education, awareness and communications component. Under this
component, the key thrust of the review will be to assess the extent of community
awareness and understanding of the importance and benefits of protecting and
sustainably utilizing mountain resources. The review of this component will draw
upon MMCT’s report on the output indicators from the key activities such as
meetings/workshops, formation of clubs among school going and out of school youth,
periodic mountain visits, awareness campaigns, print media, visual aids and sports
sponsorship, among others.

The MMCT Endowment

MMCT was capitalized with an endowment fund of USD 5.45 million in April 2005
and this is currently managed by UBS, the global investment banking leader. The
investments policy of the Trust seeks a 7.5% return on investment, with 2% reinvested
to counter inﬂation and a 5.5% drawn-down to finance operations of MMCT and

87

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

mountain management activities. The endowment has grown by ﬁnancial year end
June 30th 2009 to about USD 7 million. However, the current budget requirements
cannot be satisﬁed by the withdrawal rate.

There is a crucial need to enable this endowment model to function adequately by
seeking a substantial increase in capital that will in turn provide the desired income
stream. Based upon that experience, it was estimated that an annual budget of USD
450,000 may be enough to support project activities. To generate this on a 5.5%
withdrawal basis there would be a need to have an endowment base of USD 8 mill.
Should the endowment reinvestment be enabled on the compounding factor of 7.5%
return on investment, this ideal total would be attained in a period of just four years.
The team will assess progress being made to increase the endowment capacity to the
desired level.

Management authority capacity improvement. The Department of Forestry has a
mandated role to manage the mountains forest resources but the capacity of the district
offices prohibits this responsibility from being adequately executed. In order to
improve its capacity, the project planned to improve the current situation based upon
the priority needs of the district forestry staff. The team will assess how the planned
capacity enhancement innervations are contributing to the sustainable management of
the reserve.

The assessment of the above elements may also include the following:

Relevance - assess the extent to which the project conforms to the existing policies,
strategies and programmes.

Is the project consistent with forestry, food security and climate change strategies,
policies and programmes?

Is the project well in tune with the development policies, like MGDS, CBD work
programmes, MDGs?

Do the project innovations and interventions have potential for replication?

Eﬂectiveness - Using the established set of indicators the review team shall assess the
extent to which the programme has achieved its goals and objectives.

Assess to what extent the programme has contributed to biodiversity conservation
and improved livelihoods of surrounding communities,

To what extent are the identified outcomes results of the programmes rather than
external factors?

Was the established monitoring and evaluation system effective in directing
implementation of the programme components?

What could be done to make the programmes more effective?

Lesson: A sustainable yield is obtained (the real value of the fund is maintained). The real value of the withdrawal in 2007 US$ is lower
than the nominal value used in the project proposal. However, additional injections in the period to 2012 could address that fairly easily.

Lesson: The real value of the endowment and the annual withdrawal is highly vulnerable to inflation.
Substantial injections would have been needed to reach an adequate sustainable yield.

Lesson: during t0 yields below expected and inﬂation above expected the real value of the fund has declined from USD 5450 (begin 2005) to 4811 (end
2010), about 12%.

Information on withdrawals is precise, but start and end-value for some years derived from various reports as exact information was not received in time.

Lesson: Over the six years from 2005 to 2010, with no withdrawals, the fund would have increased by 54% (nominal) and 18% (real), or a real interest
of 2,8% per year.

101

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

Inﬂation: Index Mundi, based on CIA Factbook

Exchange rate: World Bank (years 2007, 2006, 2008). The kwacha depreciated about 5% per year against the dollar in the period 2005 to 2010 (an average
ﬁgure is used).

Figures in green were extrapolated from the trend.

Endowment fund: The figures extracted from the accounts in Proposal Document 2007 and Annual Reports 2008-2009 and 2009-2010

but these are estimates due to the change from financial to calendar years and lack of exact information. The end value 2010 is a projection.

Average annual rate of return 2005 to 2010: 5,6 %

Average inflation rate in Malawi 2005 to 2009: 10,4 %

Average depreciation of the MK against US$ 2005 to 2009:5,0 %
Average effective inflation rate: 5,1 %

Note: The effective inﬂation rate is CPI inﬂation in Malawi adjusted for changes in the exchange rate US$ - MK

Lesson: A sustainable withdrawal of about US$625.000 per year is possible from 2017.

Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project 7 A/Iid-Term Review

Analysis of projections, performance and possibilities for reaching sustainability. Figures in 1000 US$. For simplicity calendar years have

been used, though the project document uses the ﬁnancial year. This should not affect the major trend and argument.

TABLE IX: Path to sustainability with 6.0% rate of return, 3.0% inflation and a once-off injection in 2012 enabling a sustainable yield of

US$1.0 million per year.
