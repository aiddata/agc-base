SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose

The National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi requests ﬁnancial support from the Government
of Norway for the ﬁve-year period, April 2006 — March 2011.

This ﬁve-year programme tackles the challenges of continued growth and sustainability, while building on
the strong framework that NASFAM has put in place under existing support from Norway, due to ﬁnish at
the end of 2006.

1.2 The Case for Agriculture - Backbone of the Economy

Landlocked, and lacking in mineral resources, Malawi’s economy is almost entirely dependent on
agriculture, which provides 85% of the population with its livelihood. In Malawi, smallholders constitute

 

around 90% of all farmers, and provide the nation with Sm allh 01 d e 1, Contribution to GDP
76% of its food. However, as illustrated by these ﬁgures, MK billion %
the productivity of smallholder agriculture is very low Agﬁculmre: — _

economic activity.

Agriculture features highly in both the country’s Growth Strategy and Poverty Reduction Strategy. Within
these strategies it is seen that development of the agricultural sector will provide the most effective route to
increased household incomes in the rural areas, improved household and national food security, industrial
growth and increased employment.

The Government also recognises the important role of the private sector and other stakeholders, and has
accordingly strongly supported NASFAM’s role as a catalyst to smallholder agricultural development.
NASFAM’s unique position and ability to address the multi-faceted problems that smallholders face is
acknowledged. NASFAM Associations provide members an opportunity to overcome the barriers to higher
productivity which, combined with their 0an determination, has led to NASFAM’s long-term success.

1.3 NASFAM-Norway Partnership

The NASFAM-Norway partnership is built upon a shared commitment to poverty reduction through
improving the livelihoods of Malawian smallholders. In the words of Hilde Frafjord Johnson, former
Norwegian Minister of International Development “One of the main means of reducing poverty is by
focusing on agriculture, because most of the poor in developing countries live in rural areas and earn their
living by farming. Another important point is that there are strong links between agriculture and other
major development goals such as education and health.”

Under the seven priority areas for the Norwegian support to developing countries in agriculture, NASFAM
programmes directly address the following:

Policy and reforms for poverty-oriented agriculture development

Food security

Strengthening women’s rights and their participation in agricultural development
Promotion of the sustainable use of natural resources

Promotion of market development

1.4 Unleashing Smallholder Potential

The National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi (NASFAM) is the service arm of affiliated
farmer business organisations. Over a period of just seven years, with core support from Norway and
USAID, NASFAM has grown from a start-up concept to a farmer-owned and directed business system built
around the participation of over 100,000 Malawian smallholders, most farming on less than a hectare of
land.

The evolution of NASFAM has spurred a quiet revolution in the progress of rural development in Malawi.
NASFAM smallholders have become a force to be reckoned with. In 2005, NASFAM smallholders
marketed over US$18 million worth of cash crops. They have become the largest single traders on
Malawi’s auction ﬂoor, and they are now the biggest exporter of Malawi’s Birdseye chillies, with exports to
strict European markets. NASFAM has also brought smallholder produce such as rice and groundnuts to
the shelves of quality local retail outlets and fair trade markets, securing extra return and access to more
stable end markets. NASFAM is recognised as a major force for organisation of smallholder diversification
efforts in groundnuts, paprika, soybeans, pigeon peas and cotton. NASFAM members have started growing
other crops such as pulses and cassava, bringing improved household food security.

NASFAM has brought the power of collective bargaining to input and service supply. Through competitive
tendering arrangements for service and commodity supply, and an increasing network of farm supply shops,
NASFAM has made available a variety of farm inputs, the most prominent being fertiliser. NASFAM
group contracts have over time significantly reduced many input costs, reduced produce delivery times and
eliminated bribes.

NASFAM’s contributions go far beyond crop production and marketing. NASFAM has been at the
forefront in the set up and delivery of expanded financial services to rural areas. The commercial banking
system has begun to lend funds to smallholders through NASFAM initiatives. Under strategic alliances,
such as that with the Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (MUSCCO), NASFAM is working
to make savings and lending services available to all smallholders within the NASFAM system. This will
mean that smallholders will be active participants in the economic system and able to use their 0an savings
to buy food, pay school fees and meet unexpected expenses. Smallholder clubs will be able to buy their
fertiliser using their 0an saved funds. Through an aggressive policy agenda, NASFAM works with its
Associations to empower smallholder members by addressing issues of relevance to smallholders and rural
development - from improvement of rural infrastructure, promotion of irrigation, pricing systems and
marketing mechanisms for farmers’ produce, community schools and health facilities to taxation policy, and
the protection of the legal rights of women and children.

Training and capacity building has been at the core of NASFAM programmes. Through the NASFAM adult
literacy programme, over 30,000 are now able to read and write. Combined with ‘farming as a business
training’, these members are now able manage their farming business better, keep records, carry out simple
profitability analysis and improve their productivity.

1.5 “Vision 2011” - The Next Five Years

This proposal directly supports NASFAM Strategic Development
Plan for 2006-2011. It outlines NASFAM’s vision for 2011, the
challenges NASFAM currently faces in realising that vision, and the
steps that NASFAM will take to address these challenges during the
next ﬁve years. NASFAM’s programmes to 2011 are built on
existing initiatives which have already demonstrated tangible

 

NASFAM’s Raison d’Etre
NASFAM exists to improve
the lives of smallholder
farmers by promoting farming
as a business, and delivering

programmes that produce
beneﬁts. They look to address longer term development needs, economic and social beneﬁts
whilst bringing immediate commercial beneﬁts to smallholder for members, their

members, for neither Malawian farmers themselves nor the
associations that support them have the leisure of long-term vision

 

 

communities and the country.

 

unless it is accompanied by immediate gain.

.5 Expected Outputs

The underlying objective of this application for continued support from the Government of Norway is to
uplift the lives of smallholder farmers through:

Improving access to crop input and output markets

Increasing smallholder productivity in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner
Empowering farmers to participate in solving their own development challenges
Improving infrastructure for agribusiness in the rural areas in which NASFAM operates
More transparent and accountable and democratically governed member associations
Improving food and nutrition security

Improving gender sensitivity and promotion of female participation

Increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention, and adoption of mitigation measures
Building a more conducive policy environment for smallholder development
Improving member access to the information necessary to make informed decisions

These outputs fall under six main categories, which also deﬁne NASFAM’s Key Results Areas (KRA).
NASFAM has used these Key Results Areas to provide the structure around which strategies are developed
and activities are programmed. They form a consistent framework for NASFAM’s Strategic Development
Plan, annual work plans, and for this proposal.

KRA 1 : Commercial Revenues Increased.
NASFAM exists to help its farmers break out of the cycle of subsistence farming and develop farming as
a business. NASFAM offers opportunity to members to increase household incomes by providing them
access to competitive output and input markets. During the next ﬁve years NASFAM will:
- expand the volumes of crops marketed
diversify the range of crops supported in its areas of operation
- increase value-added processing and branding of produce
- expand penetration of fair trade and other niche markets
- improve the quality of crop and input storage facilities at Association level
- improve supply and distribution channels for inputs
- enhance members’ ability to access credit facilities

KRA 2 : Crop Quality and Quantity Improved

NASFAM wishes to see its members growing the best possible quality and yields of crop varieties
demanded by the market, thus assuring the highest possible returns to individual members. However,
increases in productivity need to be achieved in a sustainable a manner with emphasis on the sustainable
use of land and natural resources.

During the next ﬁve years, NASFAM will:

- through linkages with research institutions, promote the production of market-demanded crops

- improve information ﬂow to members on market demands

- provide members with access to required quality seed and other inputs

- establish seed multiplication programmes

- provide access to technology and promote technology development/reﬁnement through strengthening
links with research institutions

- increase member technical capacity through training from formally qualiﬁed ﬁeld ofﬁcers, volunteer
farmer trainers, provision of technical training materials and through radio broadcasts.

- increase learning and adoption of technology and innovations by establishing demonstration plots at
each Association

- identify and promote suitable irrigation initiatives and natural resource management practices tailored
to each Association area

KRA 3 : Association Performance Enhanced.

NASFAM is built on the principle of collective action through associations — the basis for solving the
multi-faceted problems that smallholder farmers face. NASFAM seeks to offer relevant and timely
services through these associations which are well managed, operate according to sound business
principles, and deliver their services in the most cost-effective manner. It seeks to provide members, and
where practical non-members, with the best possible technical help in regard to running their farms as
businesses - which produce the right products (crops), to the right standards, and which are ﬁnancially
sound. To achieve this requires proper governance systems supported by an active membership and
effective leadership.

This proposal includes initiatives which address capacity weaknesses that have been identiﬁed. During
the next ﬁve years NASFAM will:

- strengthen Association business management capabilities
enhance Association ﬁnancial management capacity
equip each Association with the necessary basic infrastructure and resources to conduct its operations
and communicate with its members and the NASFAM system
strengthen Association leadership and governance

KRA 4 : Member Livelihoods Improved.

Smallholder farming is more than an activity, it is a livelihood, and NASFAM equips members with skills
which promote improved livelihoods. Key problem areas to be addressed are food and nutrition security,
high illiteracy, gender inequalities and the impact of HIV/AIDS.

During the next ﬁve years, NASFAM will:

- improve member food and nutrition status through initiatives to promote improved access to foods,
such as grain banking, use of alternative food production and utilisation, and seed multiplication of
alternative crops.

- improve member functional literacy, by extending NASFAM’s adult literacy programme (which has
already brought literacy skills to over 30,000 smallholders), to the remainder of the membership.

- promote equitable participation of both sexes in Association activities and leadership

- promote sensitivity to gender and market forces in crop selection.

- equip members with prevention, care and mitigation strategies in relation to the impact of HIV/AIDS

KRA 5 : Smallholder Influence on Policy Expanded

In general, improvements in the macro-economic environment including infrastructure, ﬁscal and
monetary policies, and in broader issues of health and education, are necessary for uplifting smallholder
business performance. NASFAM has provided smallholders in Malawi with a voice and the ability to
contribute to national development. Smallholder empowerment has allowed the smallholder community
to see themselves as an engine for change rather than the object thereof.

This proposal includes continued policy advocacy programming, based on a policy platform, updated and
presented to relevant stakeholders every year. Currently, the NASFAM Policy Platform addresses four
key policy impact areas: marketing and pricing mechanisms, rural services and infrastructure, access to
financial services, and food security challenges, including land policy.

KRA6 : Systems Performance Enhanced
For the effective operation of the entire NASFAM system, each system entity must work in tandem
towards the achievement of coordinated, system-level goals. As the NASFAM system and structure
becomes more complex and expansive, it is imperative that financial and operational checks and balances
are strengthened at all levels. During the forthcoming five years NASFAM will:
- strengthen planning processes
- complete annual programme and human resource monitoring and evaluation
- strengthen information and communications systems
- strengthen financial and control systems
- put in place a grants management capability
- expand strategic alliances with other speciality organisations which enhance the ability of both
partners to better serve respective constituencies (including government research entities, other donor
supported organisations, NGOs and the private sector)

1.7 Budgetary Issues

The programme set out herein represents a consolidation and deepening, not expansion, of NASFAM’s
current activities and will be handled using NASFAM’s existing human resource compliment. During the
financial year ended September 2005, NASFAM successfully undertook donor-supported programmes of a
combined annual value of US$39 million, funded by Norway (US$1.2m), USAID (US$2.1m) and National
AIDS Commission (US$0.4m). The programming set out herein maintains activities broadly at this level,
but with a refocusing of resources towards priority areas selected on the basis of strategic evaluation of
current needs and performance.

Support from USAID will cease at the end of 2006, when the current funding agreement ends, due to major
budgetary cuts to the Mission to Malawil, and the budget request herein has been set with this in mind. The
amount sought from Norway is approximately NOK20 million (US$3.2m) annually for programme costs.
HIV/AIDS and nutrition programmes under KRA 4 are currently funded through The National AIDS
Commission, under a renewable one year agreement (US$11 m) which commences in late October 2006.
Funding from Cordaid, a Dutch NGO, of approximately USD210,000 per annum, was secured in September
2006 and will fund Farmer-to-Farmer programme activities under KRA2.

Programme budgets are detailed under Section 6 of this proposal, but are summarised below.

SECTION 2: EVOLUTION OF THE NASFAM BUSINESS SYSTEM

NASFAM’s roots lie in the USAID-funded Smallholder Agribusiness Development Project (SADP)
implemented by Agricultural Cooperative Development International — ACDI . The project, which
commenced in 1994, supported smallholder agribusiness development by improving smallholder access to
agricultural inputs and better returns on agricultural sales, supporting smallholder self-reliance and self-
sufﬁciency through improved business know-how, and promoting collective action through commercially
sound, farmer-owned associations.

2.1 Clubs to Associations (1994 - 1997)

SADP (and now NASFAM) worked with rural farmer groups, or “clubs”, to develop commercially viable
group businesses that are linked to farmer association structures through which smallholders realise
increasing returns and contribute to economic development through group action. In its ﬁrst year of
operation, SADP transferred the technical know-how to operate successful businesses, and provided
linkages to service providers designed to bring about improved and sustainable services to smallholder
clubs. As the needs of their farmer members became more apparent, SADP supported smallholder clubs to
take collective action to solve problems and to develop more structured associations of farmer clubs to
acquire economy of size and collective power of voice. These associations gradually began to develop the
capacity needed to carry out the technical services to farmer clubs previously made available through
SADP’s technical programme.

2.2 Associations to National Organisation (1997 - 1998)

Smallholder farmer clubs operate in a highly complex environment that has been in a process of continual
change for the past decade. This complexity has brought both opportunities - in the form of greater
competition and improved access to cash earnings from specialised crops - and hardships from greater
uncertainty related to inﬂation, weakening of rural credit, unexpected currency movements, and high cost of
transport. Smallholders working with SADP chose to respond to their changing environment through
expanded farmer-controlled associations that could provide the marketing services and know-how needed
by members to handle market and ﬁnancial complexities. Having realised the beneﬁts of collective action,
in July 1997 fourteen such associations decided and voted to form their 0an mother body, managed and
controlled directly by their membership, to expand this impact. The National Smallholder Farmers’
Association of Malawi (NASFAM) - now comprising thirty-ﬁve member associations - was thus formed
and formally incorporated on 11 February 1998.

2.3 A Cohesive Business System (1998 to Date)

Since incorporation, NASFAM has transformed from being a group of individual associations into a
cohesive institution capable of maximising the beneﬁts of collective action at a higher level, as well as
supporting smallholders to address their 0an problems through participation in the socio-economic
development of Malawi. As NASFAM matured to meet the needs of its growing membership it developed a
Strategic Development Programme (SDP) and on 11 December 2002 launched three subsidiaries by
function - governance, commerce and development: NASFAM Development Corporation (NASDEC),
NASFAM Commercial, and NASFAM Development.

The SDP, with its heightened focus on strengthening the associations as the core for all NASFAM system
efforts, called for all three of the new NASFAM system companies to provide expanded levels of technical
support. Each of the NASFAM organisations rose to this challenge, as described in the following
paragraphs:

NASFAM Governance - NASDEC

NASDEC moved quickly to establish direct relationships with each of its member-owners. NASDEC
provides direct, on-site technical assistance through a small cadre of regionally-based business,
management, ﬁnancial and agricultural advisors, who work hand-in-hand with association committees, staff
and members helping them deal with both strategic and day-to-day issues. Financial integrity is paramount
to operation of an effective business entity. Therefore, in addition to helping develop association ﬁnancial
systems, ﬁnancial advisors carry out audit functions, provided reports on ﬁnancial performance and control
system issues to association governing committees and NASDEC management. Since 2002, all
associations presented audited ﬁnancial accounts at their Annual General Meetings, which showed most as
going concerns.

NASFAM Commercial

NASFAM associations provided annual strategic business management plans that identiﬁed quantities and
types of products that they wish to move through the NASFAM Commercial marketing system. These were
fed into consolidated NASFAM Commercial trading plans for each season. NASFAM Commercial brought
the power of collective bargaining to input and services supply, marketing a variety of farm inputs, the most
prominent of which is fertiliser. In FY2004, NASFAM procured and sold fertiliser valued at US$22
million directly through its input supply shops, which rose in number from eight to ﬁfty-tho within two
years. NASFAM Commercial group contracts for produce transportation and other services offered major
cost savings to members and improved delivery times.

NASFAM Development

The NASFAM Policy Platform produced by NASFAM Development set out key policy issues affecting the
livelihoods of smallholder farmers, and these issues were fed directly into the issues document for the
agricultural sector in Malawi which fed into the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. NASFAM
Development advocacy, which focussed on market pricing, contributed to a 15% increase in the farm gate
price of cotton. NASFAM Development also successfully achieved the removal of withholding tax on
smallholder produce, and the refund of amounts already deducted. Both campaigns beneﬁted not just
NASFAM members, but all smallholder farmers.

NASFAM Development training interventions addressed skills gaps identiﬁed by the associations during
the strategic assessment exercise, and training focus was shifted from club and association formation toward
developing associations as businesses and empowering members as business entrepreneurs. NASFAM’s
training expertise in association development and management was made available to several other NGOs
from Malawi and neighbouring countries on a cost recovery basis. Associations entered into MoAs
outlining approaches to working with grant funds to support capacity building efforts. NASFAM
Development’s communication function brought timely and relevant extension messages to members and
non-members through expanded radio programming.

SECTION 3: PROBLEM STATEMENT

Poverty in Malawi is immense and deep-rooted. The country ranks as one of the poorest in the world with
60% of the population living under the poverty line, with limited access to clean water, health services,
education, and food. Malawi’s national development goals focus on eradicating these evils and bringing a
better quality of life to the population. The majority of the population (80%) lives in the rural areas and
derives their livelihood from agriculture, with essentially no other means of income. It is therefore evident
that investment and improvements in agriculture will have the greatest impact on poverty alleviation in the
country.

But agriculture, particularly smallholder agriculture, is faced with numerous challenges: low productivity,
lack of access to markets, lack of access to inputs and credit, lack of access to technology, lack of access to
innovations and improved seed varieties, lack of access to extension, poor rural infrastructure (including
water, electricity and storage facilities), lack of access to financial services, lack of relevant institutions,
food insecurity, poor soils, HIV/AIDS, and the list goes on. These issues are inter-linked, creating a poverty
trap.

NASFAM realises the limitations in available resources and has selected priority areas that, if addressed,
would have the greatest bearing on agriculture development and poverty alleviation for the rural masses,
most of whom are smallholders. Below are the six priority areas to be addressed by NASFAM.

3.1 Access to Markets

3.1.1 Access to Produce Markets

By far the major challenge cited repeatedly by smallholders is their lack of access to markets for their
produce. This problem has been exacerbated with market liberalisation, and specifically the withdrawal of
ADMARC from many rural areas. Smallholder farmers essentially have one source of income - sale of their
produce - which comes to them during a very short period of the year (the marketing season). By the time
the marketing season comes, smallholders need to sell produce immediately as a simple matter of survival,
to buy food, and so forth. Out of desperation, many are forced to sell or even barter produce to meet daily
needs in uncompetitive conditions. But even those who are not pushed by desperate necessity often find
that there is no market for their crops.

Most of the commodity markets into which Malawian farm produce is ultimately destined are international,
and Malawi’s production is insignificant to total demand. In one sense this makes accessing these markets
simpler, since there are no barriers to market access such as branding, and to sell produce into such markets
one simply has to supply the right quality at the right price. However, it also makes it harder, because the
challenge becomes one of producing to the quality, price and timing needs of markets in competition with
the full spectrum of other international producers. This calls for active market searches combined with an
ability to produce crops to the standards required by these markets.

3.1.2 Access to Input Markets

One of the effects of economic liberalisation has been the withdrawal of government services in agricultural
marketing and input supply in the rural areas, in anticipation that the (supposedly) more competitive private
sector would move in to provide such services. This has not happened to any significant degree, and a
vacuum has been created where smallholder farmers now struggle to access necessary inputs (and markets)
for their crops. Operating any business in rural areas is difficult, with numerous challenges derived from
lack of banking and communications services, problems of insecurity, and poor road networks for delivery
of goods. These conditions, compounded by intermittent government intervention in the area of key input
supply, deter the private sector from doing business in the rural areas, which creates a vicious circle. If
farmers fail to access needed inputs, then they fail to produce good crops. If they fail to produce good
crops, they cannot afford to buy needed inputs for the next season. This is why making sure that farmers
have access to inputs in so important - to help break this cycle.

11

3.2 Agricultural Productivity

In regard to almost all crops, smallholder productivity is low, not just when compared to yields available
under ideal conditions, but in comparison to smallholder performance in neighbouring countries, and even
compared to what has been achieved in Malawi in past decades. Some of the factors driving this include:
increased pressure on arable land, declining soil fertility, increasing land degradation, low technology
adoption, limited use of necessary inputs (due to high input prices and availability), and lack of crop
production extension services.

In 2000 the Government formally recognised that the macro-economic environment in which farmers
operate has changed significantly during the previous decade. Market liberalisation, removal of subsidies
on agricultural inputs, and the de-linking of agricultural credit from extension services had led to new
challenges and constraints for farmers. Additionally, farmers were faced with dwindling land holdings,
declining soil fertility, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Addressing these challenges required an extension
service which was properly resourced, both financially and technically. However, Govemment’s own
extension system itself faced many challenges in both regards, such as staff attrition due to HIV/AIDS,
insufficient equipment and financial resources (staff lack transport), and insufficient technical resources
(staff lack refresher training etc). It therefore failed to provide current information that farmers need, such
as that linked to marketing.

3. 3 Association Building

The strength of NASFAM lies in the strength of its member Associations, which in turn depends on the
strength of its individual members and the staff that serve them. In Malawi, the concept of working
together through Associations is still under development. There have been previous attempts which have
not borne fruit as they were crippled by two major ailments — financial mismanagement and abuse by
leadership. Without a proper system for financial management, control and accountability, members risk
losing their contributions as well as any funds the association may have — making farmers even worse off. It
is therefore imperative that significant attention is given to developing association financial capacity and
ensuring systems are in place for proper controls and accountability.

Leadership is another critical aspect of association development and management. Leaders are assigned the
responsibility of providing guidance and direction to association staff. An ineffective leadership, due to
either lack of capacity or abuse of position, prevents members from accessing benefits from the association
and may actually lead to its downfall. As such, leaders need to be democratically elected and accountable,
and trained so as to ably handle their responsibilities and protect member interests.

All these are areas where NASFAM has to concentrate to ensure that all its member associations can be
sustainable i.e. selling the idea of collective action, and then facilitating its operation in practice. This
involves espousing Association principles, values and modi operandi.

3.4 Improved Farmer Livelihood

3.4.1 Food Insecurity

For many years, Malawi has been counted among the world’s most food insecure countries. For some
observers, the important aspect is that the country has reached the point where it regularly does not produce
or import enough food to feed its population at minimally adequate levels, i.e., primarily a supply issue.
Others suggest that the most important aspect of high levels of food insecurity in Malawi have more to do
with the inability of households to gain adequate access to the food supplies they need, an issue of lack of
effective demand derived from pervasive poverty. In reality, problems of both food supply and effective
demand are inextricably linked in Malawi where 85% of the population derives its income from agriculture
and where agricultural productivity is disastrously low.

The result is a situation where 60% or more (Frankenberger, et al., 2003) of the country’s households have
regular difficulty securing nutritionally adequate food for family members — even in years devoid of

12

droughts or other natural disasters. Malawi suffers from high levels of chronic food insecurity — i.e., where
a large number of people cannot provide themselves adequately with food in good, as well as bad, years. On
top of this, droughts and other emergencies occur with regularity, adding high risk of transitory food
insecurity on top of endemic chronic food insecurity — i.e., a situation where market supplies fall
signiﬁcantly short of demand due to one or more natural or human-caused shocks.

Following the drought of 200 1/2, Malawi suffered the worst food crisis in living memory. Maize
production was similar to that obtained during previous shock periods, but the lack of ability on the part of
affected households to call on traditional sources of food — or assets readily exchangeable for food — was
startlingly unanticipated. Malawi is becoming increasingly vulnerable to shocks. There has been an
erosion of household assets and this has negatively impacted on ability to access food.

3.4.2 Illiteracy

Malawi has high rates of illiteracy, averaging 45%, but much higher in the rural areas and amongst women.
It is generally accepted that basic literacy and numeracy skills are a key to improved livelihoods. Illiteracy
was one factor reducing the effectiveness of NASFAM training programmes, since those that could not read
and write could not benefit from the training as much as those that could. In response, an adult literacy and
numeracy programme was developed for Association members in 2002.

3.4.3 HIV/AIDS

NASFAM farmers are faced with increasing challenges emanating from the HIV/AIDS epidemic. At
present, Malawi is the eighth worst affected country in the world. The adult prevalence rate stands are
almost 16%, with approximately 800,000 adults and children affected.

The problem is compounded by the combined pressures of rural poverty and food insecurity, resulting in a
rural development crisis that situates some households at the edge of survival. This includes many of
NASFAM’s members, and even the best resourced NASFAM farmer will be affected by this impact as it
undermines the community in which they live. Thus integrated and cross-sectoral responses are urgently
required. An organisation like NASFAM as a core pivot of the agricultural sector has a crucial role to play
since agriculture represents the primary foundation of food security and livelihood in Malawi.

3.5 Smallholders Involvement in Policy

Agriculture is Malawi’s mainstay, and smallholder farmers are the primary participant in the same,
contributing 33% of the Country’s GDP, 85% of the labour force, and responsible for 76% of the nation’s
food production. However, most smallholders could increase their production, and thus their contribution
to the economy, significantly if some of the many constraints that they face were to be eased. These include
such issues as access to markets for their produce, access to inputs, access to factors of production,
including land, labour and capital, access to technology, and access to credit. In general, improvements in
the macro-economic environment including infrastructure, fiscal and monetary policies, and broader issues
of health and education, are necessary for improving smallholder productivity.

Current development best practice advocates a pluralistic and participatory approach where mechanisms are
in place for the inclusion of key stakeholders’ policy concerns within the govemment’s agenda. Until recent
times, smallholder farmers were hardly involved in the policy formulation process. Policies targeting
smallholders were developed with minimal contribution from the farmers themselves. NASFAM plays a
key role by providing the smallholders with a means of expression and the ability to contribute to national
development, by empowering smallholders so they can see themselves as an engine for change rather than
the object thereof.

3.6 Systems Performance
3.6.1 Systems Integration

NASFAM consists of three corporate entities and thirty-five member associations working together to
achieve a commonly held vision. At an operational level, coordination of programme objectives is essential

13

for the maintenance of symbiotic relationships across the system. This includes such aspects as equitable

intra-system pricing mechanisms, conﬂict resolution mechanisms, systems for inter-company participation
and co-ordination, and so forth. Such proper systems integration enables each organisation to play its role
effectively in relation to other system members and have all entities pulling together in the same direction.

3.6.2 Leadership and Management

The NASFAM model that farmer members have created is one that is new for Malawi and inevitably
complex given the size of the organisation. As such it provides numerous challenges. Each of the three
companies within the system has its 0an governance structure (Boards of Directors or Advisory Councils),
its 0an programmes, responsibilities and accountabilities, its 0an staff and cost centres. Each of the three
companies also has responsibilities and accountabilities to the overall system. As the holding company for
the NASFAM organisation, NASDEC is responsible for effective management of the entire system and for
ensuring the system operates to the benefit of its owner/member associations. NASDEC and its Board of
Directors provide oversight and appropriate support for the work of all three companies.

Whilst the boards of NASDEC and individual member organisations carry the ultimate leadership roles
within the system, management at different levels throughout the system are also charged with leadership
responsibilities. Clear channels of leadership need to be present to maintain the focus of all entities on
achievement of the NASFAM vision and global objectives, to maintain strong motivation amongst system
players, to direct the effective allocation of system resources, and to allow member participation in system
programmes.

3.6.3 Intra-System Information Flow and Management

Accessibility of appropriate and timely data and information is a prerequisite to effective decision making at
all levels. Members need information on technical matters, NASFAM/Association programmes, and
similar information, presented in an accessible manner. NASFAM management requires information on
member needs and profiles, on member and non-member production, on markets and association
programmes and requirements. The timely ﬂow and management of such information requires proper
systems and mechanisms and clearly defined areas if responsibility.

Currently, individual entities collect and manage their 0an information, which creates gaps and overlaps at
a system level, and duplicates effort. The information technology requirements underlying this are
significant, starting from association level through to head office. Expanded computer facilities,
telecommunication access and data analysis and interpretation capabilities are needed to provide NASFAM
with the level of information desired.

SECTION 4: PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION (2006 — 2011)

This section looks at the major challenges that face the NASFAM system as it works to achieve its vision.

It also sets out the major steps that NASFAM will take during the next ﬁve year period to provide beneﬁts
that more fully meet the many and pressing needs of the smallholder community, and to attain system

sustainability.

4.1 Programme Goal

This ﬁve-year programme has been developed

“to improve the lives of smallholder farmers by promoting
farming as a business and by delivering programmes that
produce economic and social beneﬁts for members, their
communities and the country.”

The programme goal supports the over-aching vision of
NASFAM.

4.2 Programme Beneficiaries

 

 

NASFAM Vision

“NASFAM will set up and operate a
sustainable, smallholder-owned
corporate system, and it will use its
position as the leading smallholder-
directed business organisation in
Malawi to promote development and
implementation of initiatives that
produce economic and social
beneﬁts for NASFAM members,
their communities and the country.”

KRA 1: Commercial Revenues Increased

 

1.1 Access to Output Markets

Crop Finance.

Smallholders do not have the luxury of waiting to sell their produce. By the time crops are ready for sale,
farmers are desperate for funds - so desperate that they may be forced to sell at any price to any buyer to
meet basic daily survival needs. It is critical that NASFAM associations are equipped to buy all member
produce at competitive prices, in the quantities and at the times it becomes available. The underlying
constraint in achieving this goal is a lack of working capital, or crop ﬁnance.

The need for capital and the overall sustainability of NASFAM is also directly linked. Margins on many
crops are relatively small, even when selling into international markets. Associations, and NASFAM in
general, work on the principle of economies of scale. It is critical to NASFAM Associations becoming
ﬁnancially self-reliant that crop trading volumes increase substantially and, as with any business operation,
this can only be achieved through a signiﬁcantly expanded capital base. One can add additional
management, technical capacity, or market opportunities, but without working capital the system cannot
operate.

Traditionally in Malawi interest rates have been prohibitively high, especially for businesses involved in the
agricultural sector which have long production cycles. Current commercial rates of 30% per annum, which
are the lowest for many years, can still completely absorb or exceed possible trading returns. For NASFAM
associations, the problem is compounded by a total lack of collateral which can be offered to lending
institutions as security.

This lack of crop ﬁnance is the one constraint which, more than any, undermines the ability of NASFAM
associations to service their membership.

NASFAM is seeking support for a working capital fund which can be accessed to support crop procurement
activities. The Review Team proposed a method of achieving this whereby funds amounting to
USD600,000 to be used for development activities during the ﬁnal two years of the proposal period would
be advanced at its inception. These funds could then be utilised by NASFAM to ﬁnance crop procurement
from Association members during the ﬁrst three years of the proposal period, and repaid in full to the
programme for use in the fourth and ﬁfth years. This arrangement had the advantage of having no cost
implications and would still be strongly preferred by NASFAM. However, if it is technically problematic
for the Embassy, NASFAM would like to propose that a similar arrangement be put in place through a bank
which would manage the fund for a management fee. Opportunity International Bank Malawi (OIBM) has
is a suitable bank with complimentary objectives to NASFAM, and has previously indicated that it would
consider such an arrangement for a fee of around 3% per annum. This would be NASFAM’s second
option, die to the higher cost implications.

Warehousing.

Good quality warehousing which is both clean and secure is a prerequisite in regard to crop procurement
and to input sales, but infrastructure to support it in the rural areas is largely missing. Association members
are unable to maximise gains from economies of scale due to failure to pool crop produce to appropriate
quantities prior to sale.

For practical reasons of management and coordination, it is advantageous to combine warehousing facilities
with ofﬁces structures. To date, warehousing facilities have been constructed in 20 NASFAM
Associations, but structures are still needed in the remaining ﬁfteen associations which currently rely on
expensive rented, sub-standard facilities. Poor standard warehousing is of particular concern, as it can lead
to seriously quantitative and qualitative crop losses. Warehouses will also be constructed under ‘matching
grant’ as ofﬁce structures described under section 3.2

18

1.2 Access to Input Markets

Farm Supply Shops.

As of late 2005, NASFAM member organisations operated 52 farm input supply shops, retailing a variety
of farm input supplies, including fertiliser, household supplies, foodstuffs, and produce drawn from within
the NASFAM system. This allowed NASFAM members and their communities to access their farm and
household requirements competitively against a tide of withdrawal from rural areas by other traders and
suppliers.

During late 2005, the Government of Malawi introduced the provision of subsidised fertiliser. Like all rural
agricultural supply shops, NASFAM shops largely rely on bulk fertiliser sales to cover overhead costs. The
subsidy caused a collapse in sales by the private sector, and NASFAM was also hit severely, with cash sales
of fertiliser falling to negligible levels. NASFAM is in the process of re-assessing supply shop operations
as the Government clariﬁes its longer-term position regarding subsidised fertiliser and plans to allow the
private sector to participate in its supply. Assuming that fertiliser can in one manner or another again
become a product linez, the immediate priority is then not to increase the number of shops but to increase
the customer base and proﬁtability of the existing shops. Many could easily double their incomes in less
than a year but have been severely constrained from doing so because of lack of working capital.
Proﬁtability can also be increased by improving the way they are organised and managed, and by
introducing improved operational systems and controls. The area will receive careful attention during the
ﬁrst year of the proposal period as external issues clarify.

 

2 At the time of writing (October 2006) Government is finalising plans with the support of DFID to include private
sector companies in a limited manner in the supply of fertiliser under its subsidy scheme. NASFAM is set to
participate in this in a small way to clear unsold stocks carried forward from last year. NASFAM looks forward to this
avenue of involvement being expanded in future years, although recognises this may be contingent upon DFID’s
continued willingness to provide underwriting facilities. If this arrangement continues, the option of importing and
distributing fertiliser through NASFAM supply shops will be actively reconsidered next year.

19

 

KRA 2: Crop Quality and Quantity Improved

 

In response to dwindling extension services, the
Government developed a new pluralistic, demand-
driven Extension Policy which is based around
private-public partnership. This presents a
conducive environment for NASFAM to engage in
a much more comprehensive extension
programme for its members.

NASFAM commenced its own extension services
in 2002 in response to farmer demand, driven by
existing deﬁciencies. The programme
successfully piloted a number of activities, and
based on programme evaluation data, the need to
replicate and expand these services has been
manifest. Although NASFAM has its own core
extension service, it is structured to provide
linkages with Government Extension where it
exists, with research institutions such as
ICRISAT, ARET, and with Bunda College, and
other NGO or Private Sector service providers. In

 

 

NASFAM-ICRISAT Partnership
Until the 1980’s Malawi used to export signiﬁcant
quantities of groundnuts to European markets, and the
local variety, Chalimbana, was widely sought by
confectionary markets. However, decline in the
quality of seed stocks, and increasing problems with
aﬂatoxin, led to a collapse in this export venture. In
2003, NASFAM entered into partnership with
ICRISAT to address these problems by providing
improved, higher-yielding seed stock, training
farmers on how to avoid aﬂatoxin development, and
implementing quality control systems to ensure
contaminated nuts are identified and traced back to
their source. The success of this ongoing programme
was evidenced in early 2005 when NASFAM sold its
ﬁrst two containers of groundnuts into British fair
trade markets in full compliance with the strictest of
international standards, and gaining fair trade
premiums for its Mchinji Association.

 

 

regard to Research Institutions, NASFAM’s focus is providing a bridge between such Institutions and
farmers, and in regard to Government and Private Sector organisations, NASFAM’s focus is on
complimenting rather than duplicating existing provision.

This section sets out NASFAM’s overall extension objectives and programmes, and then details speciﬁc

delivery methodologies.
Crop Production Objectives

2.1 Market-Driven Crop Production

 

Farmers are guided towards producing the crops that are demanded by the market, and which

optimise the returns they receive.

2.2 Sustainable Increases in Productivity

Farmers are assisted in achieving sustainable increases in productivity for their crops. This involves
implementation of programmes designed to increase yields.

2.3 Sustainable Land and Natural Resource Management
Farmers are assisted in managing and utilising their land, water and other natural resources in an

environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.

2.1 Market Driven Production.

It is important that farmers grow “for the market”. For NASFAM, the process starts with informing farmers
which crops are demanded by the market and in what form. Using a variety of extension methods, farmers
are then helped to grow the targeted crops, and instructed how to prepare them to the required quality

speciﬁcations for marketing.

Guidance is provided through joint strategies between the production and marketing functions within
NASFAM. While market demand provides the direction, due consideration is also given to the crops that
can be produced with comparative and competitive advantage. Hence each Association will have different

20

core crops. Members are informed of the options through production campaigns and through the regular
quarterly general meetings. Every attempt is made to have more than one crop in an effort to reduce
production risks.

Quality management is a major aspect that NASFAM will promote, starting with establishment of seed
systems, promoting best practices crop agronomy, cost effective and safety conscious pest and disease
management, market oriented harvest and post-harvest management, and with constant mentoring and
training.

Where the crops are either new, or existing seed stock is of sub-standard quality, NASFAM links with
research institutions such as ICRISAT or Government research institutes, bringing the market needs directly
to these organisations, and thereby adding to the relevance of their programmes.

A few opportunities exist where Malawi can access more specialised, niche markets. In such markets,
provided usual quality requirements are met, NASFAM can utilise the “brand” principle to leverage
premium returns. Examples here include Malawi Birds Eye chillies (which are of unusual potency) and
Kilombero rice (a highly aromatic, long-grain rice). NASFAM also has opportunity to access fair trade
markets by virtue of its status as a smallholder-producer organisation. In 2003 NASFAM’s Mchinji
Association was Fair Trade certified, and in early 2005, two containers of groundnuts were accepted in the
Europe for use in a new fair trade peanut brand being launched by Twin Trading (a prominent British Fair
Trade organisation). Efforts have already been initiated to expand the Fair Trade programme to more crops
and Associations.

The crop production programmes will provide support to the marketing activities through provision of crop
production estimates to enable the marketing team to determine an optimum marketing plan for the year’s
crop. Accurate estimates enable the correct balance to be made between forward contracts and holding
stock till later in the season in anticipation of price rises. The crop production programme also assists in
establishing costs of production which inform production choices by individual farmers.

Crop diversification. Prices offered in commodity markets are traditionally unstable, and it is important
that smallholders mitigate their exposure to price ﬂuctuations by growing a variety of crops. In 1994, at its
inception, NASFAM’s primary focus was to assist tobacco farmers in marketing their crop. However, due
to a number of pressures, including the anti-smoking lobby, NASFAM has taken deliberate steps to promote
alternative cash crops. This is done through crop production campaigns as well as farmer contacts at
scheduled meetings. The radio programmes also afford excellent opportunity to implement this activity.
The challenge in such a move is to find for farmers crops which can earn at least (and ideally better than)
the returns available from tobacco. The close relationship between marketing and crop production
functions here again comes to the fore, and marketing opportunities identified will be presented to the crop
production department to assess crop husbandry suitability in relation to NASFAM association areas.

2.2 Sustainable Increases in Productivity

Increasing Yields.

NASFAM has developed yield enhancement strategies that take a holistic approach, from choice of crop in
an ecological area, to providing access to seed of high yielding varieties, and application of recommended
agronomic practices. By enabling a farmer to increase the yields from his/her land, NASFAM gives
farmers a powerful tool for increasing their returns and household incomes. Enhancement strategies are
also holistic in the sense that they consider crop quality not just quantity. Thus the strategies followed at
least improve productivity without compromising quality, and ideally also improve quality.

Yield enhancement will be achieved through the following strategies:
Recommended Crop Husbandry. Simply by providing the farmer with information on best practice

techniques, most smallholder farmers would be able to improve their crop yields significantly. Such
information, disseminated through radio, bulletins and extension personnel and often illustrated with the

21

help of demonstration plots, covers aspects of seed selection, land preparation, time of planting,
ridge/planting spacing, plant nutrition using an appropriate mix of organic and inorganic sources, weeding,
pest and disease control, harvesting, and post-harvest handling. The approach will be to focus on three to
four impact points that have immediate impact on yield enhancement as a starting point until the practice is
adopted , then moving on to other focus points. A typical example the practice of planting groundnuts and
soya with ridge spacing of 1 metre. This spacing is correct for tobacco, however a spacing of 60 cm is
required for groundnuts and soya. By using the wrong spacing, not only is the yield reduced by half, but
this also results in increased pest damage.

These approaches will be supported by programmes aimed at minimising the constraints to yield
enhancement, such as access to key inputs such as seed, chemicals and fertiliser. A major thrust of crop
production function over the coming years will be the establishment of appropriate seed systems that ensure
suitable seed is made available and affordable.

Technology adoption. Technologies for increasing productivity and quality have been developed and are
available within Malawi but are not widely used. The Crop Production programmes aim to increase
exposure and awareness of the various technologies to smallholder farmers through extension messages,
demonstration plots, crop bulletins, radio messages, and training sessions. This will be done through the
extension system existing within NASFAM and through linkages to public research institutions, as well as
international CGIAR institutions.

Irrigation and Water Management. Malawi’s agriculture is predominantly rain-fed and in recent years,
decreases in rainfall quantities and erratic rain patterns have affected crop production volumes. In 2002,
Malawi received very erratic rains, leading to ﬂooding in some areas and droughts in others. The result was
widespread low crop production. Such experiences highlight how proper rain and water
harvesting/management can assist to stabilise moisture availability for crop growth.

NASFAM’s approaches will firstly be to establish access to water resources that are available at the
moment such as existing dams, rivers, and underground water reservoirs. Where these are not readily
available, efforts will be made to establish small dams and implement water harvesting activities.

Secondly, NASFAM will build capacity in members to implement irrigation programmes in terms of land
preparation for irrigation, effective water management for productivity without wasting the water resources,
and management of the equipment for irrigation.

Linkages will be made with irrigation specialists in public and private sectors and a more comprehensive
irrigation strategy will be developed during 2007.

NASFAM’s programme of small-scale (supplemental) irrigation will improve water management to enable
crops to survive erratic rainfall patters, and increasing production by supplementing the main crop with
winter cropping. While cash crops are the main focus, food crops will also be encouraged to ensure
household food and nutrition security.

The potential for crop production from dambo (wetland) areas is significant. Whereas most arable land can
only grow one crop per year, a second (and sometimes third) “winter” crop can be grown in these dambo
areas. Traditionally, smallholders use dambos for vegetable growing, but they can be used for other food
and cash crops with equal effect. NASFAM is operating an increasing number of dambo demonstration
plots to promote winter cropping.

NASFAM has since 2005 been engaged in a partnership with The USAID Compass II Programme in the
promotion of drip irrigation in most of its Associations.

22

2.3 Sustainable Land and Natural Resource Management

Land is Malawi’s livelihood. The challenge faced by smallholders and NASFAM Associations is farming
in an efﬁcient manner, and in increasing production in a manner which is sustainable both economically and
environmentally on landholdings that are increasingly shrinking under a growing population. Natural
Resource Management (NRM) is integrated in all crop production initiatives through the following:

o NASFAM promotes agro-forestry, whereby those shrubs and trees that alleviate soil pests, and add
nutrients to the soil are promoted. Through a collaborative linkage with the World Agro-Forestry
Centre, farmers are equipped with information on the different species, which are useful in agro-
forestry practice, and are available to them.

0 NASFAM encourages farmers to participate in all afforestation programmes and participates in the
national tree planting month on an annual basis. Both forestry and fruit trees are promoted and about
1.4 million trees were planted in 2003.

0 Use of organic manure is promoted for purposes of improving the soil texture as well as supplementing
the use of inorganic soil nutrients that are very expensive for smallholder farmers.

0 Land management to reduce erosion through contour bunding, planting of plants that will signiﬁcantly
reduce the erosive power of strongly ﬂowing water streams will be promoted.

A) NASFAM’s Farmer-to-Farmer Programme

The NASFAM farmer membership forms a huge base of agricultural expertise and experience. Building on
this base, in October 2003, NASFAM initiated a farmer-to-farmer programme (FTFP) as a mechanism for
sharing this expertise between the membership and at the same time recognising high performing farmers
by encouraging their participation in programme delivery. The programme is designed to spread best
practices, using locally based human resources, without the costs associated with the employment of large
numbers of college-trained extension workers. The programme also works to strengthen member
involvement and thus ownership.

23

The programme does not replace the use of qualiﬁed extension staff, but compliments it, allowing their
training to propagate much more effectively. For extension to be truly effective, it is necessary that the
particular needs of each individual farmer are addressed, and this requires that a mechanism exists whereby
each farmer can directly access some form of contact during the year specific to their area and needs.

The programme was piloted in 2003 in two Association areas, involving 98 farmer trainers (77 male and 21
female). On average, each farmer trainer made about 60 farmer contacts. The key outcome of the
programme was observed in an over 50% yield increase.
An increase in membership was also observed as non-
member farmers saw such practical benefits of
membership. The programme was expanded in 2004 to
21 Association areas, with 610 farmer trainers.

B) Association Extension Staff

At a higher level, Associations coordinate extension services through Association Field Officers (AFOs).
Each Association employs several AFOs, who are resident and distributed across the Association area, and
act as a link between the Association management and the farmers. They supervise and coordinate the
activities of the farmer-trainers in their respective areas, provide specialised training in business acumen,
and help existing and prospective members understand Association concepts.

With the reintroduction of agriculture training at the Natural Resources College, NASFAM is looking to
recruit from this crop of diplomats, who are better qualified to strategise, plan, and coordinate the
implementation of production and marketing activities within their AMC. They will form the bridge
between the Associations and the Production and Marketing functions at NASFAM Head Office and
Regional Offices.

C) NASFAM Crop Production Department

Ultimate responsibility of meeting crop production objectives lies with the NASFAM crop production
department. The department works hand in hand with the marketing department to develop comprehensive
crop strategies which respond to market opportunities. The crop strategies specify how a crop will be
grown and the quality required in order to satisfy various markets. In furtherance of crop diversification
objectives, the crop strategy team closely watches the market for new opportunities. Once these are
identified, the crop production team identifies areas of suitable production potential, through its
understanding of the agronomic profile of the various NASFAM Associations, and promotes the crop there.

24

D) Radio Programmes

NASFAM airs two half-hour radio programmes nationally each week. These programmes carry a broad
range of crop production and marketing information. Use of the broadcast medium to propagate such
technical information allows both members and non-members to beneﬁt from extension, and is in line with
NASFAM’s overall objective of furthering the development of smallholder communities in Malawi. It also
helps arouse interest of non-members to join NASFAM Associations and thereby enjoy the fuller beneﬁts
of direct participation as a member.

E) Technical Bulletins

Crop-speciﬁc bulletins are produced addressing technical issues of production and post harvest handling,
and providing information on marketing. Bulletins present information in a concise format, focussing on
pertinent, current issues, and allowing timely production and distribution to members. The bulletins
compliment information provided over the radio, providing a more permanent library of information, and
facilitate interaction between club members and their AFO.

KRA 3: Association Performance Enhanced

 

Achieving the sustainable system represented by NASFAM’s vision requires that all components operate
efficiently and effectively. To a large extent, success or failure will be determined by the ability of
NASFAM to empower members and staff with the knowledge and skills required to understand and play
their roles well. This is nowhere more so that at field level, and section describes some of the main
challenges in the ability of Associations to perform, as well as programmes and actions in place or planned
to meet these challenges.

 

NASFAM OPERATING PRINCIPLES

In all of its interactions, NASFAM will:

0 Place priority on serving the needs of rural communities and smallholders and serve as an effective
advocate for policies and programmes that result in lasting and meaningful economic development.

0 Design and develop opportunities for smallholder ownership
0 Operate to the highest standards of professionalism, honesty, integrity and transparency

0 Maintain organisation independence and remain apart from partisan, religious and other forces that might
compromise such independence

0 Operate with democratic principles and participatory approaches
0 Create and maintain a culture of self-reliance that motivates and develops human resource capacities
0 Ensure equal rights of participation for all members regardless of gender and status

0 Use its resources to leverage new economic opportunities for smallholders, both within and outside the
NASFAM system

0 Encourage and promote a spirit of volunteerism within the NASFAM system

 

 

3.1 Business and Financial Capacity
A) Business Management Capacity

The key to the NASFAM system is the ability of each association within the system to operate as a
successful business. Each must continue to generate and expand its 0an services and programmes in order
to sustain itself and contribute to the system. NASFAM is expanding the emphasis placed on assisting each
association to realise such business capacity. In early 2005, NASFAM hired the services of a Business and
Institutional Development Manager and three regional Business and Institutional Development Advisors
whose function it is, together with Regional Managers, to work to with each NASFAM association to
develop and put into place its individual strategies for growth, and to design the approaches that each will
take to putting the NASFAM franchise model into place.

Deliverables for the Business and Institutional Development Advisors will include preparation of in-depth
strategic business plans for each association within the system and identification and delivery of business
training activities required to support plan implementation. Once strategic plans are in place and approved
by the board and general assemblies of the Associations, Advisors will work with the association boards
and management teams to support implementation of the plans. As a first step this includes development of
annual work plans and budgets, and assistance in their implementation.

26

 

As well as giving assistance at a more strategic level, Advisors provide advice on the day-to-day running of
the association as an effective business. This may include time management, information management, the
effective application of limited resources, and governance matters.

Within the business model developed by NASFAM associations themselves, there is provision for
associations to develop and add non-crop revenue generation schemes to benefit their members. Revenue
generation can take place around farm supply shops, maize mills, village grain banks, special training
courses in everything from farming to cooking to literacy/numeracy — all offered by farmers to farmers on a
for-fee basis. There is more that remains to be done to help NASFAM associations to develop such revenue
generation activities. One of NASFAM’s major findings to date is that the setup and management of
association commercial activities needs specific and specialised support and insight.

B) Financial Development

Audit and Financial Services. Associations are particularly vulnerable to financial mismanagement due to
both human resource and infrastructure constraints (e. g. lack of banking, communication, transportation and
security services). Low literacy and numeracy levels amongst association membership restrict effective
leadership and management oversight of financial operations and personnel. Coincident with a recent, rapid
growth of association operations, particularly in relation to farm input supplies, NASFAM has fallen victim
to some financial misappropriation by association personnel. Such misappropriation is of major concern, it
is vital to take strong preventative action. NASFAM will strengthen and expand the Audit and Financial
Systems (AFSU) function. Under the direction of an experienced and fully qualified audit manager
recruited from a local professional firm, three regionally-based financial advisors currently work hand-in-
hand with association staff and leaders to develop their financial management skills and help them to deal
with the larger financial challenges of their business. They facilitate the development of transparent and
accountable systems at association level. NASFAM will also run, in conjunction with the University of
Malawi Polytechnic, an intern programme to support placement of interns as needed to augment capacity
during peak times.

Internal Checkers Training. Each AMC employs at least one bookkeeper responsible for the clerical
accounting functions of the constituent Associations of the AMC. Each Association governing board
appoints three members to serve as Internal Checkers (farmer board members trained to conduct simple
audit functions), responsible for periodic review of the books of account and compliance with accounting
procedures. Being farmers and fellow members, Internal Checkers command the trust of the general
membership and provide them additional confidence in the Association’s financial management. Internal
Checkers receive appropriate bookkeeping and auditing training from the Audit and Financial Services staff
and provide a much more immediate mechanism for detecting irregularities than can be offered by
regionally-based staff from AFSU. In this regard, the Internal Checkers and AFSU play important,
complimentary roles.

Since the inception of the Internal Checkers programme, incidents of internal financial irregularities have
decreased significantly.

3.2 Management/Staff Capacity Development

A NASFAM Decentralised Management System

In 1997, at its inception, NASFAM comprised only fourteen associations in five districts. Today,
NASFAM operates in sixteen of Malawi’s twenty-nine districts. Initially, operations were controlled from
head office, with a Field Operations Manager based in Lilongwe responsible for Association oversight, but
NASFAM’s expansion has necessitated a new management approach. Operations in each region are
coordinated locally from Regional Centres, by Regional Managers. This brings the management process
closer to each Association, allowing the implementation of policies to reﬂect specific regional factors
understood by the local staff, rather than broad brush, national solutions. Regional Managers are available

27

to respond to urgent calls the same day, and no Association is ﬁirther than three hours drive from their
regional ofﬁce.

Regional ofﬁces also provide hubs from which capacity building technical assistance for the Associations is
delivered. This includes business capacity audit and ﬁnancial systems development (see section 3.1 above).

Periodically, Association Managers come together at a regional level and these fora provide an opportunity
for planning, collective brieﬁng from head ofﬁce staff and regional management, and for exchange of ideas
between associations.

this new course.

Lilongwe

However, management is a practical skill and,
as with other practical skills, its development
requires a mix of theoretical training,
opportunity to put theory into practice, and
one-on-one assistance as particular difﬁculties
are encountered and overcome. NASFAM
will continue to provide on the job training and technical assistance in business management to its
Association Managers. One-on-one assistance from the Business Advisers will be supported by periodic
formal training in areas such as business planning, feasibility studies, and business identiﬁcation and
viability assessments. The Managers will also be trained in basic ﬁnancial management, crop production
and marketing.

 

 

In order to achieve effective skills development for the association staff in such a diversity of areas,
NASFAM operates an aggressive and scheduled training programme. This is based on an annual,
comprehensive training needs assessment carried out in all the association areas. The training programme
speciﬁes which staff members are to be targeted , when the training will be conducted and what areas the
training will cover. Where expertise is lacking in the NASFAM training or other relevant programme unit,
the training is contracted out to external service providers, including Bunda College and the Natural
Resources College.

Grant support programme. NASFAM recognises the importance of clear contractual relationships
between all entities in the NASFAM system. Memoranda of Agreement have been put in place between

28

NASFAM and member associations setting down expected association activities and outputs and technical
and other NASFAM support offered to associations.

The process of developing sustainable associations requires technical capacity building assistance, but also
requires that associations have in place the right calibre of staff, and the necessary equipment and facilities.

NASFAM associations are initially unable to pay enough to attract the calibre of managers needed to build
and run successful businesses that can upgrade the production and marketing programmes that form the
backbone of each association’s operations. Associations are in “chicken and egg” positions because,
without the required high calibre staff, they are unable to generate the increased revenues necessary to
support hiring more professional managers. NASFAM addresses this by putting resources into working
with associations to put effective managers in place.

Improved Association Infrastructure. Necessary services and infrastructure for agribusiness
development are unavailable in most rural areas, or where available, in a bad state. This has slowed down
growth of smallholder business, and has been a disincentive to investment. Under previous phases of the
Norway-NASFAM partnership, NASFAM has been able to provide basic office and warehousing facilities
in half of its association areas.

 

Construction is carried out on a “matching grant” basis,
where the associations supply unskilled labour and locally
found materials such as bricks, sand, and water, and
NASFAM provides skilled labour and hardware items as
required. The matching principle of partnership helps to

NASFAM is built at all levels around the principle of farmer-ownership and control, and this has been a
critical factor in its success. Association control is exercised through the democratically elected association
boards, which have been entrusted by the members to represent their interests as they work hand in hand
with the association management.

Association boards bring the views of the grass root membership directly into the management process. But
because the board members are themselves drawn from the smallholder community, they usually require
extensive capacity building to enable them to effectively govern the association.

Leadership Training

Immediately subsequent to annual elections, the NASFAM Training Unit conducts committee training
sessions with each association highlighting the following:
- governance and leadership
- the relationship between association board and management
- association financial management

KRA 4 Member Livelihoods Improved

 

4.1 Food and Nutrition Security

Food insecurity in Malawi must be confronted by economic growth of a type that creates employment and
incomes and this growth must, almost certainly, come from investment in the agriculture sector.
Agricultural productivity has to improve, and the best chance for that to happen is from the smallholder
sector capable of increasing production or increasing the incomes derived from the sale of produce of
greater per unit value; that is to say from farmers just like most NASFAM members. In its most simple
form, what NASFAM members need to do to improve their food security is to be successful as NASFAM
members.

Whilst this sets a general long-term strategy for improvement, NASFAM needs to assist its members to
strengthen their ability to cope with l- or 2-year food emergencies and develop a generalised safety net for
its members. NASFAM’s approach is to assist its associations to develop ways to help their members gain
more secure access to food during 1-2 year periods of food shortages while at the same time maintaining
focus on maximizing incomes through increased productivity.

To this end, in 2004/5 NASFAM commenced piloting the development of “grain banks” at two
associations, which essentially “bought maize when the price is low and sold it when the price was high.”
The purpose is to guarantee availability at prices that still cover costs and make modest profits for the
associations. This scheme has shown reasonable success and will be expanded to the majority of
Associations over the next five years, as start-up capital funding allows.

Alternative food production and utilisation. Malawi’s food security status would improve by
encouraging alternative food production and utilisation. Malawi demonstrates an overwhelming demand
for a single crop, maize, as the food of preference, which generates a greater risk of inadequate food
availability when growing conditions for this one crop are not within acceptable tolerances. More
generally, there is extreme dependence on rain for crops — above all maize — which are sensitive to the
amount and timing of moisture availability. In recent decades, there is evidence of increased variance in
seasonality of precipitation and a corollary lack of irrigation infrastructure and other sources of water
availability for crops during the dryer seasons of the year. Malawi is the most densely populated country in
the world that depends on a single growing season and single predominant food crop.

NASFAM will extend its crop diversification efforts to include food crops that either can be grown
alternately with maize under irrigation, or can be grown in drier conditions.

4.2 Functional Literacy

To address the problem of illiteracy, NASFAM has for three years conducted adult literacy training. Now
consisting of two levels, “Level 1: Basic Reading and Writing”, and “Level 2: Basic Business Skills”
(including English for business communication), NASFAM has been overwhelmed by both the demand and
critical acclaim the training has received. The courses, open to members and their families, have to date
been attended by approximately 30,000 individuals, who are now more productive farmers as a result. The
courses have also benefited others as the trained members impact their Associations and communities.

The course provides an opportunity not only to teach generic reading and writing skills, but to communicate
through the contents of the materials being studied. In addition to its basic business focus, the course also
includes HIV/AIDS and gender modules, and consideration is being given to the incorporation of a new
module covering people with disabilities.

31

NASFAM continues to experience a high level of demand from members who have accessed no training to
undergo the Level 1 course, and for those who have beneﬁted from Level 1 to progress to Level 2. Level 2
brings an increased focus on application of reading and writing skills within simple business contexts.

During the next ﬁve years, NASFAM plans to provide Level 1 and Level 2 training to 12,000 and 6,000
members annually.

4.3 HIV/AIDS - Prevention, Mitigation and Care

In brief, HIV/AIDS has a direct and negative impact on NASFAM’s core objective of improving the
livelihoods of its members. NASFAM has thus recognised that the organisation must engage
comprehensively with the epidemic through a holistic strategy that enables its staff and membership to
prevent and mitigate the multiple impacts of HIV/AIDS.

Under the NASFAM-Norway Phase II programme, NASFAM developed a comprehensive HIV/AIDS
programme that is integrated and cross-sectoral in nature. Funding for an initial programme was secured
from the National AIDS Commission in November 2004, and the programme ran successfully to
completion in May 2005. Application for funding for a second, three year, programme was submitted in
early 2006 and it is anticipated that a grant agreement will be in place by the end of October 20063 . In
essence, the programme covers three key areas of response:

Prevention - strengthening food and livelihood security, with a particular focus on women is required to
arrest socio-economic behaviour that increases HIV transmission risks. This can be addressed, for example,
through education workshops on prevention strategies and understanding the dangers of the epidemic.

Care - In the context of HIV/AIDS, nutrition represented a primary health care component, as a
nutritionally balanced diet seems to improve the control of HIV infection and mitigates the health impacts
of AIDS. This can be addressed through nutrition oriented policies focussed on producers and connecting
with established home based care initiatives.

Mitigation - In AIDS affected households and communities, the resulting labour and economic stresses
impair agricultural activities and seriously aggravate food insecurity. Mitigation comprises measures that
seek to alleviate the impact of AIDS. These include alleviating labour loss and shortages, mitigating AIDS-
related economic crises, arresting agricultural disruption, advancing food security, enhancing nutrition and
maintaining community dynamics. The programme also includes the identification and promotion of labour
saving agricultural technologies both for infected and affected members.

4.4 Gender Main-Streaming

For the past three years, the gender programme has concentrated on training both male and female leaders
and ordinary members in gender concepts and the benefits of integrating gender issues within the
Association activities. To facilitate this, structures have been created at the association level where Gender
Committees (a sub-committee of the main board) are elected and Gender Officers (a member of the
association staff) appointed, who are responsible for promoting and coordinating all gender and HIV/AIDS
programmes within their association.

Building on the awareness training delivered to date, NASFAM will now move its emphasis to broader
gender programmes such promotion of female crops. In this regard, NASFAM will make efforts to include
crops that are traditionally grown by women in its crop strategies, which will allow more women to
participate in and benefit from association activities.

 

3 NASFAM has been informed that the programme and budget have passed all internal stages of NAC approval, and
the NAC Financial Management Agency is in the process of preparing the agreement.

32

Associations will be encouraged to review the level of beneﬁts going to male and female members, and to
consider how their services can ensure equal access to both sexes. For example, the timing of radio
programmes, of training delivery, and so on, may signiﬁcantly affect the ability of the different sexes to
participate in these services.

In the past, although women were encouraged to participate in leadership positions, their participation was
limited because of strong cultural barriers, and lack of exposure and mentors. During the forthcoming
period, NASFAM will train women leaders and potential leaders in assertiveness, effective leadership, and
how to overcome cultural barriers to leadership.

Equitable representation and participation of men and women can only be provided through ensuring
representative inclusion of both sexes at all levels of leadership, from club committees up to association
boards. To address the imbalances present, female empowerment for leadership will therefore be conducted
at all levels of organisation.

The outworking of gender issues in different parts of the country varies, due to differing cultural
backgrounds and inﬂuences, general education levels, and other social factors. One of the most effective
ways of imparting behaviour change is through sharing of experiences. Due to its wide geographic
coverage, NASFAM is able to draw upon a variety of lessons learnt and case studies to develop best
practices. Gender officers and sub-committees will meet annually affording the opportunity to document
such case studies and best practices.

33

 

KRA 5 : Impact on Smallholder Livelihoods Expanded

 

5.1 Policy Advocacy

NASFAM has developed a policy agenda based on consultations throughout the entire NASFAM system
and with key stakeholders. This has been packaged and presented in a Policy Platform, updated and
presented to relevant stakeholders every year. It highlights key policy impact areas, outlining issues
affecting smallholder livelihood, specifying impacts, NASFAM stance and speciﬁc action to be taken.
Currently, the NASFAM Policy Platform addresses four key policy impact areas: marketing and pricing
mechanisms, rural services and infrastructure, access to ﬁnancial services and productive assets and inputs
(including land ownership, fertilisers, etc.) and food security challenges. With ever-changing economic and
social challenges, the NASFAM policy programme will continue to be important to the success of the
NASFAM business system.

During the NASFAM-Norway Phase II partnership, NASFAM expanded its advocacy programme and
organised the ﬁrst ever Regional State of the Smallholder Conference and Exhibition. Here NASFAM
members and smallholder farmers in Malawi, and from the SADC region, showcased their challenges and
agenda, and set up policy targets with key government ministries, multi-national corporations and local
private sector organisations. The Conference, based on the four policy impact areas, came up with working
groups and task forces that were assigned the responsibility of spearheading advocacy on selected issues.
This approach allows NASFAM to partner with other civil society organisations with similar interests to
have a more coordinated advocacy approach to inﬂuence policy.

The Art of Advocacy. Successful advocacy is a complex art, requiring a detailed understanding of the
political, economic and social environment, and often calling for a multi-pronged approach, creativity and
great tenacity. Depending on the subject matter, NASFAM will use the following tools in its advocacy
work.

Linkages and Networks. NASFAM was initially founded on the principle of collective action in
marketing but this principle has proved effective in all facets of its operations. NASFAM is an active
participant in selected inﬂuential networks, including the SADC based Food, Agriculture and Natural
Resources Policy and Advocacy Network (FANRPAN) and the Malawi-based Civil Society in Agriculture
Network (CISANET). Through CISANET NASFAM will, together with other civil society organisations,
monitor Malawi Government budgets and expenditure especially on agriculture, food security and rural
development. NASFAM will also be involved in advocating for a steady, consistent and where possible
increasing budget allocation to these key sectors. Through FANRPAN, the key advocacy issues address
will be regional and international trade, looking at how developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa can
beneﬁt from international trade, and also advocating for the removal of unfair trade practices. This
advocacy work will be based on ﬁndings and/or information gathered from major policy studies undertaken
in of the countries within the region.

In our global economy, international policies and practices represent a key constraint in the advancement
agriculture in developing countries. As a result, advocacy is also taking on a global nature. Initially
through FANRPAN and other international lobbying and advocacy groups such as The Partnership to End
Hunger in Africa, based in the USA, NASFAM will participate in global advocacy, with beneﬁts realised
beyond Malawi’s borders.

Policy Formulation. NASFAM prefers a pro-active rather than reactive approach to inﬂuencing policy.
Signiﬁcant effort is exerted to ensure that smallholder perspective is included before a new policy is
ﬁnalised or an old one is redesigned/reformulated. In the past, NASFAM has contributed substantially to
the development of both the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy, which is the current roadmap for Malawi’s development. NASFAM has also
contributed to the development of the Food Security Policy, National Gender Policy, National HIV/AIDS
Policy, and the Land Policy.

34

NASFAM’s value in the policy formulation framework is evidenced by increasingly frequent invitations to
sit on the boards of major institutions. NASFAM currently participates in the following boards or
committees:

- Civil Society in Agriculture Network (CISANET)

- National Action group

- Joint Food Security Task Force

- Malawi Environmental Endowment Trust

- Tobacco Control Commission

- Pesticides Control Board

- Cotton Development Association

- National Research Council of Malawi

- Trade Policy Network

- National Export Strategy

- Agricultural Representative of WTO

- Agricultural sector lead organisation on the EU-ACP Economic Partnerships Agreement

NASFAM will continue to sit on such boards where it is able to present the smallholder perspective and
actively and favourably inﬂuence policy and programmes.

Policy Fora. In addition to playing an advocacy role, NASFAM encourages the sharing of ideas amongst
relevant stakeholders and periodically brings them together in managed policy fora. In taking such
initiatives, NASFAM gains an advantage through directing the process. Such fora also provide an
opportunity for formulation of a consensus in regard to policy direction.

Policy fora sometimes take the form of workshops, and sometimes of specialised panel discussions on radio
or television, and by providing an opportunity for civil society to present its opinions, policy makers are
able to make better-informed choices.

NASFAM plans to hold at least one policy forum each year on the issue then currently most pressing. This
forum will serve to build consensus amongst key civil society stakeholders and develop an advocacy plan,
in addition to providing a vehicle of advocacy itself.

Position Statements. As an acknowledged voice of the smallholder community, NASFAM’s perspective
on issues of national interest is often sought. As new issues arise, or new developments take place in regard
to matters of on-going concern, NASFAM formulates a smallholder position through careful research and
interaction with its membership at the grass root level. This is presented by way of a position statement
published in the national media, and presented directly to relevant parties.

Position statements have been issued on subjects as diverse as produce pricing, genetically modified
organisms, and child labour. Key to the development of position statements, as well as advocacy in general,
is the ability to acquire adequate, relevant and accurate information. NASFAM will use in-house capacity
to carry out policy research and studies, but where its capacity is limited, the services of well qualified
external consultants will be sought.

35

 

KRA 6 System Performance Enhanced

 

6.1 Systems Integration

The NASDEC technical approach to systems management for the 2006 — 2011 period includes the
following activities and steps.

A) Strategic Planning Cycle

The strategic planning process within NASFAM is ongoing and starts from the grass root membership.
NASFAM exists to beneﬁt members and NASFAM’s strategic development is directed to accomplish this
in a comprehensive and effective manner. Therefore, the foundation of the strategic planning process is a
continuous reassessment of the benefits members want, and measurement of those that they derive, from
participation in the NASFAM system. Consultation starts at the action centre level, where members are led
through a process of defining the benefits that they have received and areas needing improvement. This
review is two-tier and two-way, looking at the services provided directly by the individual association and
those received from corporate system entities. Results of this are refined at association level and
consolidated nationally.

This initial stage of the process results in a vision of where members want NASFAM to be, but does not
describe the strategies for achieving the vision and wherewithal for their implementation. These are
developed by NASFAM’s core management team and Board of Directors and presented in the form of a
draft strategic development plan (SDP). This plan is put before the NASFAM General Assembly for
adoption.

Reviews are made annually, drawing on data from the consultative processes described above, and from
NASFAM’s performance monitoring indicators. This ensures that the SDP is dynamic, allowing
amendments to be made in response to the current environment.

B) Leadership and Management

As big businesses that are growing, NASFAM member organisations need to have managers and leaders
who can direct large farming businesses to realise expanded business revenues as well as design and
spearhead rural socio-economic development activities in areas of direct relevance to their membership and
their communities. However, significant capacity issues exist at member organisation level, in particular in
regard to leadership and management.

At leadership level, this focus on capacity has driven the addition of new, external members to the
NASDEC Board, bringing legal, financial and commercial expertise. As part of its Systems Management
Programme, NASFAM will carry out a programme to develop and strengthen the Boards of Directors and
Advisory Councils. Working with the services of a short-term institutional development specialist,
NASFAM will support the ability of each board within the NASFAM system to develop and put into place
a Leadership Mission. These Leadership Missions will spell out the roles and duties of the Boards with
relation to development of the organisation, define the ways in which Board members will work and set
targets for performance against which the Board will judge itself. The missions will describe and spell out
the Board’s roles in assessment, in monitoring organisation performance and providing support to company
executive officers. Finally the missions will spell out the approaches that the NASFAM Boards will take to
prepare updated strategic business plans for each separate company, as well as the system as a whole.

Board empowerment in this manner will help ensure strengthened farmer ownership and direction
throughout the system, and promote responsiveness to member needs.

Whilst the boards of NASDEC and individual member organisations carry the ultimate leadership roles
within the system, management at different levels throughout the system are also charged with leadership

36

responsibilities. Clear channels of leadership need to be present to maintain the focus of all entities on
achievement of the NASFAM vision and global objectives; to maintain strong motivation amongst system
players; to direct the effective allocation of system resources; and to allow member participation in system
programmes.

C) Intra-System Information Flow and Management

Accessibility of appropriate and timely data and information is a prerequisite to effective decision making at
all system levels. Members need information on technical matters; NASFAM/Association programmes;
and similar information; presented in an accessible manner. NASFAM management requires information
on member needs and profiles; on member and non-member production; on markets and association
programmes and requirements. The timely ﬂow and management of such information requires proper
systems and mechanisms at all levels and clearly defined areas if responsibility.

Currently; individual entities collect and manage their 0an information; which creates gaps and overlaps at
a system level; and duplicates effort. With the assistance of a short-term communications specialist;
NASFAM will develop an integrated data management system that will allow not only consolidation; but
also proper validation and improved access. By allowing all system members to access the same
information; and to share information; decision-making and coordination will be improved.

The information technology requirements underlying this are significant; starting from association level
through to head office. Expanded computer facilities; telecommunication access and data analysis and
interpretation capabilities are needed to provide NASFAM with the level of information desired.

D) Operations and Procedures

For NASFAM to have the maximum positive impact on the livelihood of its members; the whole system
has to work as if it was one big farm. Crops are selected on the basis of expected market demand (or on the
basis of growing contracts); they are grown where the best yields may be expected; the correct amounts of
inputs are purchased and delivered at the right time; produce may be pre-sold when the prices seem
favourable; etc.; etc. In short; the whole system must run like a well oiled machine. However; this can only
succeed if NASFAM’s members are committed to always work within and through the system. In the past;
although members were supposed to work through NASFAM; this was a strictly moral commitment and
they were in fact free to do as they pleased; as there was neither penalty nor enforcement.

Therefore; NASFAM will transform and tighten up many of its operating procedures that spell out the
responsibilities of various parts of the system to each other. The more important of these responsibilities
will be codified in formal agreements between the different parts of the system. NASFAM will assist
associations as well as their members to solidify their understanding and awareness of ownership of the
system. At the same time; it expects the NASDEC Board of Directors to develop and adopt rules that spell
out the consequences of non-compliance with the formal and informal agreements to work exclusively
through the NASFAM system - the ultimate consequence being loss of membership in NASFAM. With
support from appropriate short-term experts; NASDEC will consult with the Boards and leadership of
member associations on what procedures are needed and how they should be implemented to best assure
that transactions outside the system are minimized if not eliminated.

E) Human Resource Capacity Development

As the NASFAM system grows; the demands on staff increase. To keep staff fully equipped to meet these
increasing needs; NASFAM runs an integrated staff performance monitoring and capacity building
programme. Bi-annually; supervisors conduct appraisals with each staff member where progress against
work plan targets is measured; and skill gaps are noted; training needs identified; and personal capacity
building plans set out. These plans are collated by the human resources department in conjunction with
company directors and NASFAM training department; and the organisation-wide capacity building plan is
updated.

37

NASFAM also runs a management trainee programme. NASFAM sees the value of employing young,
bright individuals of potential straight from tertiary educational establishments. NASFAM is a forerunner
in many of its programme approaches, and it is of signiﬁcant advantage to recruit and shape talented people
from an early stage in their careers. This programme places increased demands on the capacity building
programme. Such individuals are also in high demand within the local marketplace, targeted by both
private sector companies and international organisations/agencies. NASFAM therefore has to recognise
their market worth both in terms of package and training expectations.

Ultimately, the beneﬁciaries of all NASFAM capacity building are the farmer-members. All NASFAM
programmes and services are directed to providing member benefits. Capacity building is always linked to
enabling staff to better deliver the programmes for which they are responsible. Farmers are therefore
involved directly when ascertaining capacity building needs. Farmers are consulted during ongoing
programme monitoring and evaluation and the needs of the farmers themselves and the ability of the staff
delivering services to meet these needs are specifically assessed. In the case of staff directly interacting
with farmers, this upward feedback is the primary driver of personal capacity building plans.

6.2 Financial Management and Control Systems

Poor financial management has destroyed the reputation and operation of many community-based
operations in Malawi. Few entities have enjoyed a life span of more than three years, and in this regard
NASFAM has already shown a significant difference and made its mark. However, as the NASFAM
system and structure become more complex and expansive, it is imperative that financial checks and
balances are strengthened at all levels.

During the forthcoming five years, NASFAM will strengthen its ability to provide appropriate financial and
administrative services, both within associations themselves, and within the head office companies that
service them. Each system entity has specific financial and administrative needs, and NASFAM will
continue to develop and refine systems within each entity to best meet their precise operational needs. For
example, the financial accounting and reporting requirements of development grants and of sub-grant
management pertaining to NASFAM Development differ entirely from the commercial requirements within
NASFAM Commercial. The financial and administrative systems demanded for effective running of
associations cross the commercial - development divide, and must meet the needs of both. But at
association level, systems must also recognise the real constraints which exist in terms of ability to attract
and retain skilled financial staff in rural areas, and be transparent enough to be monitored by Internal
Checkers (farmer board members trained to conduct simple audit functions). Indeed, in regard to
implementation of efficient and tight financial systems, associations present the most significant challenge
within the entire system. And because of the connected nature of the system, the effectiveness of
association systems significantly impacts the ability of head office systems to deliver accurate and timely
information.

The central finance function, operating within NASDEC, acts as the financial guardian and gatekeeper for
the entire system. It provides the financial link between the three head office companies and member
associations. System reporting has to meet internal management needs, where profit centres and areas of
responsibility are paramount, and external reporting needs, in particular relating to donors, where formats
and budgets require different bases of presentation. Budgetary control and responsibility must be at both
profit centre and, where required, donor budget line item level.

To build a responsive accounting system that can meet all these needs is a major challenge. In many ways

the accounting demands of NASFAM and resultant complexity of the systems required are significantly
greater than many multi-national corporations, due to NASFAM’s diversity of operations.

38

6.3 Performance Monitoring and Impact Evaluation

NASFAM sees monitoring and evaluation as more than fulﬁlling a donor requirement. It is intrinsic to the
management and development processes of the system, and is a prerequisite to effective project
implementation. In order to ensure success of the planned activities for the next five years, NASFAM will
continue placing emphasis on the following;

A) Programme Evaluation

Evaluation is the periodic assessment of a project’s relevance, performance, efficiency and impact — both
expected and unexpected — in relation to stated obj ectives. Evaluation helps to identify effects (both positive
and negative) that are attributable to the programme.

In order to assist with programme planning, review and ongoing modification, NASFAM conducts surveys
at the commencement of each programme and periodically thereafter during its implementation. Using
standard participatory approaches, such surveys provide members an opportunity to mould their own
programmes, ensuring that programmes address their real needs and not simply those perceived.

Furthermore, due to the general level of rural poverty, and the success so far of NASFAM Associations,
members expect an ever increasing diversity of services to be provided to them through their Associations.
Conducting base line surveys allows NASFAM to prioritise needs and best target limited resources.

B) Impact Assessment

NASFAM is a service organisation, and its raison d ’élre lies in its ability to satisfy the needs of its
members. Triennially, NASFAM conducts a major impact survey, individually interviewing at least one
member from seventy-five percent of its clubs, the most recent being in June 2004. Additional interviews
with non-members from impact areas are also conducted to act as a control. These studies are guided by
rigorous statistical design and analysis techniques, which ensure that results are statistically significant. In
years between these major impact assessments, NASFAM conducts programme evaluation exercises,
already described above.

C) Baseline Surveys

Prior to commencement of new programmes, or expansion of existing programmes to new areas, NASFAM
collects key data which acts as a baseline, against which future progress can be measured.

If as a result of a baseline survey it is found that indicators which are deemed as prerequisite to the
successful outcome of a proposed programme are not favourable, the programme may either be modified or
even suspended. This willingness to only work on programmes and to expand to geographic areas where
NASFAM is able deliver results has underpinned NASFAM’s success to date. Expansion and programme
plans have been based solidly on this principle, despite political or other pressures from different sources.
Results from baseline surveys are also entered in the NASFAM Tracking System.

D) NASFAM Tracking System

In order to manage a complex array of information from the entire NASFAM membership, NASFAM
developed a computerised database which operates across the (currently) ﬁfteen AMCs and NASFAM
Head Ofﬁce. Raw data is collected by Association Field Ofﬁcers and entered to remote installations of the
NASFAM Tracking System (NTS) software at AMCs by Data Entry Ofﬁcers. Each week, AMC data is
transmitted to Head Ofﬁce and synchronised with the main, national database. Data entry and management
at AMC level is a major task, requiring trained ofﬁcers capable of detecting outlying data, and cleaning it
prior to submission. Although based within AMCs, Data Entry Ofﬁcers report to the Monitoring and
Evaluation Manager at Head Ofﬁce.

A growing range of standard reports is produced from NTS pertaining to: membership ﬁgures,
disaggregated by gender and/or crop and/or area, cost of production for each core crop, and marketed
volumes. In addition to their internal use, such reports are made available to other stakeholders either on
request or more commonly in support of advocacy initiatives.

NTS also includes details of such data as landholding, family size, ages, date of joining NASFAM, and
crops grown. It also allows for tailored queries on an ad hoc basis.

 

6.4 Strategic Alliances and Development Partnerships, and Technical Assistance

NASFAM collaborates with a range of other projects and Business Experience Exehange
development initiatives. A word of caution is appropriate Programme (BEEP)

here. NASFAM maintains open dialogue with all BEEP brings together research and rural
organizations and activities involved in smallholder farmer producer organisations, to help bridge the

NASFAM maintains close contact with organizations such
the International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and Agricultural Policy
Research Unit (APRU) to bring the beneﬁts of technical research and training to its farmers.

 

 

 

In the period 2007 onwards, NASFAM will enter an even greater period of collaboration. In cooperation
with the Natural Resource College, NASFAM will look at ways to develop and implement a producer
Association development and management course where NRC brings theoretical know-how which is
supplemented by NASFAM’s practical expertise. This addresses the needs of non-member farmers and the
many organisations working with rural communities and supports revenue generation for both NASFAM
and NRC.

40

NASFAM will provide its member associations with a deeper level of technical assistance by tapping and
using resources available through ICRISAT, Government Research Stations, Bunda College, and other
specialty organisations. NASFAM, though its ﬁeld-based market and pricing information activities, will be
equipped to work more closely with Famine Early Warning Safety Net (FEWSNET) to expand the
relevance and impact of the early waming system. Through its membership in CISANET and Food,
Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Advocacy Network (FANRPAN) NASFAM will expand its
policy advocacy function.

Alliances entered into by NASFAM might be better described as “development partnerships”. This is
especially applicable in areas such as environmental conservation, seed multiplication and development,
irrigation, ﬁeld demonstrations, HIV/AIDS and gender integration, and provision of ﬁnancial services,
where NASFAM may work with a government research entity, another donor-supported organisation, NGO
or private sector company in ways that expand the ability of both partners to better serve their
constituencies/customers and meet their needs. The partnership that NASFAM has developed with
MUSCCO is a good example here. In both cases, these organizations provide access to specialist expertise
that supports NASFAM’s ability to expand the service package it is able to offer to member associations,
while, at the same time, these organizations are able to use the NASFAM system to achieve their 0an goals.
In both of these cases, the partnership was developed around the fact that the ability of both organisations to
meet their technical requirements could be enhanced by working together — without a great deal of added
expense. Other current or potential partner organisations include ICRISAT, Opportunity International Bank
of Malawi (OIBM), ARET, MASIP and NRC. Memoranda of Agreement will be developed to govern
these partnerships.

NASFAM’s request for support to Norway makes provision for awarding sub-grants to partners. This will
support NASFAM’s ability to develop and operate in the strategic alliances and development partnerships
described above.

Technical Assistance Fund. As NASFAM moves to implement its current strategic plans, in addition to
identiﬁed challenges, new and unforeseen challenges continually arise. Dealing with these challenges in an
effective manner often requires acquisition of new knowledge or skills. NASFAM’s Technical Assistance
Fund provides a ﬂexible pool of ﬁnancial resources available to all levels of the system to fund needed
expert assistance. This may be in the form of South-to-South partnerships, short to medium term consulting
assistance, or participation in international networks.

41

SECTION 5: NASFAM’S APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability is a primary goal for NASFAM. NASFAM has been mindful from the outset of the need to
tackle the challenge of building and controlling its 0an future — to make the jump from running as a
programme to being an organisation of substance.

5.1 Sustainability Defined

NASFAM’s drive for sustainability was one of the factors which drove the strategic redesign of the
NASFAM system and the creation of a tri-partite corporate structure in 2002, where each organisation is
able to focus on its specific core role, and follow operational best practice for the sector in which it
functions.

For NASFAM Commercial, being a commercial market development and trading subsidiary, sustainability
comes when it has developed the capacity to cover all its operating costs, and provide needed returns to its
primary clients, the buyers and sellers of product - both those who are members of the NASFAM system
and those who are not.

For NASFAM Development, as the channel of development resources to other entities within the NASFAM
system, sustainability comes when it has developed the capacity to control and direct the application of
outside resources within the system. Sustainability means development of a diversified funding base,
through cementing long-term relationships with an increasing number of reliable development partners, and
developing relationships with an increasing number of private sector companies which are looking for a
trusted and accountable partner with whom they can work to fulfil their social responsibilities.

Sustainability requires the set-up and operation of efficient NASFAM system entities that provide both
smallholder members and external clients / partners with services for which they are willing to pay. Such
sustainability calls for the ability to borrow and apply wisely the structural, organisational and operational
tools of major corporate systems to NASFAM so that the NASFAM system can benefit from creative,
tested corporate strategies.

Apart from the financial aspects of sustainability, NASFAM also recognises that it must achieve
sustainability in leadership and management, organisation and institutionalisation of activities, technology,
environment, socio-cultural and beneficiary participation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, NASFAM
understands that sustainability will be achieved only within the framework created by an empowered
membership who participate in the development of the system.

5.2 Pillars of Sustainability

NASFAM’s sustainability strategy is based on six pillars.

11) Smallholder Ownership and Control

The future development of the NASFAM system must be envisioned, owned, and directed by its
membership through active participation and perception of a material benefit from such ownership.
This is fundamental to achieving the levels of commitment and participation required for successful
implementation of plan activities and the endurance of the organisation.

Smallholder ownership and control ensures that NASFAM delivers benefits actually desired by the
membership, rather than those that are assumed by management and external stakeholders to be
beneficial. NASFAM’s approaches to operation facilitate the development and expansion of fee-for-
service activities throughout the entire system. NASFAM’s ownership structure is based on democratic
representation which creates a dynamo for change, providing feedback mechanisms direct from the
farmer to leadership and senior management.

42

12) Business Principles

To be both an effective provider of business services and a development catalyst, NASFAM must ﬁrst
and foremost see itself as a good business and operate as such. NASFAM is therefore fundamentally
built around business principles which provide the cornerstone for achievement of ﬁnancial
sustainability. This philosophy underlies separation of commercial and developmental activities into
discrete corporate entities. It also underlies the split of association activities into four key operating
areas under a business model in which each area operates as a cost/proﬁt centre.

Business principles underpin the relationships among different entities in the system; whether non-
proﬁt or for-proﬁt, NASFAM entities recognise their responsibilities to each other in written form.
Relationships between associations and NASFAM are deﬁned by performance-based contracts,
detailing expected outputs and inputs by both the association and NASFAM, be it crop production,
marketing commitments, or development grant support. Each organisation has the capacity to source
services from the other units within the system, some of which involve fee-based transactions within the
system itself.

13) Organic Growth
NASFAM is built around the beneﬁts of collective action and economies of scale. NASFAM’s ability

to impact on the livelihoods of an increasing number of members and non-members is critical to the
effectiveness of its operations. Retention of membership requires that members increasingly see the
beneﬁts of participation because satisﬁed members encourage other farmers within their communities
to join NASFAM better than any other means. NASFAM growth is organic, thereby decreasing cost of
development and increasing revenue potentials. NASFAM moves into new geographical areas of
operation where there is a groundswell of desire from farmers to join the NASFAM system. NASFAM
facilitates groups of motivated farmers through association formation. NASFAM ultimately grows
because the system is working and is worthwhile joining.

The inclusion of non-members in selected NASFAM activities allows NASFAM to access a broader
base of support, giving greater support to advocacy activities, and acting as an outreach mechanism
towards membership growth. Whilst procurement of produce from, and sales of inputs to, non-
members strengthens the ability of NASFAM to impact on wider communities, it also improves
NASFAM’s ﬁnancial position, thereby generating increased beneﬁts for existing members.

The organic growth approach is not limited to membership alone, but is also applied to all NASFAM
operations. For example, in moving up the value chain it is tempting to try to set up large scale
processing operations immediately. However, this is unrealistic because of the underlying management
and other resource requirements. NASFAM pursues a gradual evolution up the chain in terms of scale
and level of processing, starting with cottage industries, and only developing to large scale operations
as capacity and demand permit.

(4) Use of Development Funds

NASFAM sees ﬁnancial sustainability as distinct from total ﬁnancial self-reliance, or the ability to
operate without access to any development funds. While total ﬁnancial independence would certainly
be desirable, NASFAM’s role as an important development catalyst in Malawi makes this both difﬁcult
and unrealistic. NASFAM has important development roles to play. Financial sustainability, deﬁned as
“the ability to generate or attract external resources to support important operations, without total
dependence on donor funds for key staff positions and recurrent costs”, is seen as realistic and
appropriate .

 

In this context, where development funding is utilised in relation to programmes which are designed to
lead to increased income generating capacity, funds are used only to prime or kick-start activities.
Donor support is leveraged so as to gain maximum beneﬁt from scarce resources.

43

(5) System Financial Relationships

Each entity in the NASFAM system has a well-defined role that governs and directs ﬁnancial
relationships and interactions with other system entities. Each entity is a profit/cost centre, and is
charged with the responsibility of either revenue generation or cost recovery. Each entity can contract
in its 0an right with external parties, but can call upon the capacities and assistance of other system
members as required.

 

(6) Responsibility for Results

Responsibility for performance and achievement of results must be directly placed in the hands of
farmers and their representatives. As NASFAM farmers and member organisations are involved

directly in the work of organisational development and support, they become responsible for delivery of
results against targets, and work with a bottom line orientation which enables them to handle increased
responsibility and generate improved results to support their 0an operations.

 

NASFAM’s member organisations are the driving force of the NASFAM system: the strength of
NASFAM lies in the strength of these entities, and their ability to operate as effective centres of service
delivery. In measuring service delivery, emphasis is placed on impact rather than activity. This
approach is applied at all levels of the system with profit / cost centres that are operated by managers
who are charged with delivering agreed-upon results in the most efficient manner.

5.3 Indicators of Sustainability

Having defined sustainability, it is also necessary to measure it. NASFAM needs to have in place key
indicators that will tell the system that it is getting stronger and more sustainable, and have mechanisms for
recognising progress against these indicators.

NASFAM’s Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP) sets out a complete Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E)
system to guide measurement of progress against indicators.

5.4 Sustainability Forecasts

Business plans and financial forecasts have been completed on an ongoing basis for various of the entities
within NASFAM, and in particular for NASFAM Commercial operations. However, financial forecasts are
only as meaningful as the assumptions which underlie them and the accuracy of the data which is entered,
and NASFAM has to date lacked the capacity to build properly integrated financial forecasts for the whole
system, due to the complexity of such a task.

Within its commercial operations, tensions exist between competing needs of different parts of the system.
For example, a groundnut is sold for a certain amount to a final buyer by NASFAM Commercial. In simple
terms, the proceeds of such a sale must:

- contribute to the costs of running NASFAM Commercial

- contribute to the costs of running the Association

- cover the costs of and provide a return to the smallholder who grew the groundnut.

How the proceeds are divided is critical to running the system and the sustainability of each constituent.
And because all are ultimately inter-related, it is necessary to get each component right, otherwise the
whole system will fail either sooner or later. A consolidated model is therefore highly desirable, and
important to the design of pricing mechanisms and funding strategies for different systems components.

Added to the basis for sharing of revenues, an understanding is needed of “member psychology”. For
although ultimately revenues come into the system from crop sales, how they are transferred between the
Association and the member and vice versa - including the perception of how this takes place - can mean
the difference between satisfied or discontent members.

44

For example, Associations can take money directly from crop proceeds, and thus pay members relatively
less for their produce. Such a strategy has the beneﬁt of “direct deduction”, which is more common in
Malawi, and is one which members may feel better about. However it does mean that Association revenues
are more unpredictable (dependant on crop performance, market prices, etc), and come late in the year.
Alternatively, Associations can pass on to members higher prices for their produce, and collect their
revenues through higher membership fees paid by the members. This latter system is advantageous to the
Association, as it is more predicable, and provides funds at the start of the year. However, the payment of
such fees is not a well established practice in Malawi, and may therefore be much less well received by
members, although better performing members could well be better off from such a system.

An integrated model allows for testing of different scenarios and ascertaining what levels of operation are
needed for sustainability.

To create such a financial model, accurate data is needed on such things as:

- member preferences

- crop value chains

- crop production possibilities in each area

- input markets and costing

- Association and supply shop costs at different levels of operational capacity
- Head Office operating costs at differing levels of trading

- market trends

Financial models of each individual Association then need to be built, and integrated with similar models of
Head Office operations (NASFAM Commercial and NASFAM Development), and then various scenarios
created.

Only recently, with the institution of the Business Development Unit, and assistance over a three month
period from two volunteer Accountants from the United Kingdom, has it been possible to develop a
comprehensive financial tool for Association budgeting and financial monitoring. This tool was field tested
in mid-2005, and data is currently being input for the current financial year. It is then planned that during
the first half of 2006 work to build an integrated model such as described above will be commenced.

In the meantime, the remainder of this section sets out findings from the more generic financial forecasts
constructed to date.

Associations

The forecast below shows consolidated association financial performance under four scenarios. Scenario 1
is based around NASFAM’s current position. Scenario 4 demonstrates a possible state of affairs where
associations totally finance their activities, with no external support (except for extension activities, which
take place at association level, but are covered under the Crop Production Enhance Programme under
KRA2). Scenarios 2 and 3 shows intermediate steps on the path between these other two.

Scenarios 4 shows that financial sustainability would be possible with, for example, the following
assumptions:

- increase in membership to 150,000

- increase in average membership fees from MK150 to MK250 per person

- approximate tripling in commodity trading volumes

- a 60% increase in fertiliser and other input volumes

- an 11% increase in the volumes transported under the transport programme

- adequate working capital to finance the expansion of activities

Clearly, other break-even scenarios are possible, with different proportions of the needed income coming

from different areas of activity. The comprehensive forecasts developed during 2006 will consider options
in detail.

NASFAM Commercial Programmes

Projected revenues and costs for NASFAM Commercial under Scenarios l to 4 above are shown below
(excluding technical support costs). It can be seen that NASFAM Commercial also covers its core overhead
salary and operating costs under Scenario 4.

The ability to reach Scenario 4, and the speed at which it is reached, critically depend on NASFAM’s
ability to secure adequate working capital. Current crop trading levels require working capital of around
US$600,000. Commodity trading at Scenario 4 levels would require access to working capital of around
MK1.5 million.

Assuming working capital is available, it is believed feasible to reach Scenario 4 by the end of the ﬁve year
programme period.

NASFAM Development Programmes
NASFAM Development is the channel of development resources to other entities in the NASFAM system.

It is held that it is unrealistic, at least in the short to medium term, to expect that smallholders will pay for
long-term development programmes. The greatest threat faced by NASFAM at this time is reliance on a
limited number of donors, particularly until such time as NASFAM’s Associations and commercial
operations are fully self-financing. During the programme period NASFAM Development will look to
expand its funding base and develop relationships with a broader range of development partners. This
includes not just the more traditional agency donors, but the commercial private sector. NASFAM will also
explore the possibility of creating an endowment fund to cover core costs of the development function.

NASFAM has never sought to provide all services required by smallholders and where possible prefers to
go into collaborative arrangements with specialists. An example of this is NASFAM’s partnership with
ICRISAT in relation to groundnut seed and production improvement. NASFAM will also seek to link
Associations with service providers who are self-financing. In a sense, NASFAM will seek to partner other
development service providers who can provide required services to its membership.

Currently NASFAM either has secured funding or is in the process of negotiating support or partnership

SECTION 7: IMPACT TO DATE

NASFAM’s Strategic Development Programme has been blueprint for change and development outlining
vision, guidelines for operating programmes and institutional change, and sustainability plans for the
entire system. The last two years, 2003 and 2004, have fallen under the Consolidation Phase — cementing
the move from the extension structure needed to support initial association formation and system
development into a sustainable system created by three corporate entities working together within a
commonly held vision. The results to date of activities carried out under this Consolidation Phase,
accomplished largely with support provided by Norway and USAID, are described below in terms of
major areas of activity.

7.1 NASFAM Systems Realignment / Integration

Although NASFAM has a clear overall vision, a major challenge exists in harmonising the objectives of
individual entities within the system and the broader system objectives. For example, strategies for
maximising NASFAM COMMERCIAL proﬁtability and strategies for maximising member beneﬁts may
not automatically be complimentary, or may even seem to conﬂict. Synchronisation of strategic
objectives is critical to system-level sustainability. Threads of connection must exist at the highest and
lowest levels of operation. Such proper systems integration enables each organisation to play its role
effectively in relation to other system members and have all entities pulling together in the same
direction.

Under the guidance of a Systems Advisor recruited in April 2004, NASFAM has taken significant steps to
bring synergies and strengthen coordination across the system. In particular, in order to provide for
market driven production, the Crop Production function was moved to NASFAM COMMERCIAL, the
commercial subsidiary, where teams drawn from the Marketing and Crops Departments are allocated to
work in tandem on each crop type.

NASFAM DEVELOPMENT was created to provide development services to the system. However, an
inconsistency existed in that institutional capacity building functions were split between NASFAM
DEVELOPMENT and NASDEC. To rationalise the capacity building function, both institutional
development and business capacity building functions were redefined and placed within NASFAM
DEVELOPMENT.

Having removed all operational functions from NASDEC, NASFAM’s holding company is now better
able to focus on its governance and leadership role, and provision of group-wide support functions such
as human resource management, information technology, and administration. Additionally, and in
keeping with its oversight role, NASDEC retains the internal audit function.

To improve management and supervision of NASFAM’s growing association base, the Field Operations
Department at head office was reorganised and the managerial function was decentralised to the regional
level. Regional offices were strengthened to house a regional manger, responsible for provision of
managerial oversight of all associations within the region, alongside two regional auditors, a regional
business advisor, and a NASFAM COMMERCIAL representative. Placing these personnel and related
services regionally allows for staff to develop a deeper understanding of the associations with which they
work, and for a more speedy response to association calls.

As NASFAM has proceeded further down the path from a project to an established organisation, the need
for more comprehensive personnel policies and procedures was apparent. The function of human
resource management was separated from administration in late 2003, and an experienced human
resource manager contracted and brought into the senior management team. Since this time, human
resource plans have been established, policies and procedures have been strengthened and documented,
and compliance issues raised by changes in labour law and practice have been addressed.

7.2 Governance

During the transition phase of the SDP, the overall composition of the Board was expanded to include
four ex-ofﬁcio members drawn from various professional sectors, in order to enhance its capacity.
Following this expansion, intensive training was conducted, focusing on the role of the board in
leadership, ﬁnancial management, and policy formulation. The strengthened board was also able to take
a more active role in representing the organisation and farmers in general in national and international
fora. The board has also been active in guiding and mentoring individual member associations, as they
resolve challenging governance and policy issues.

In member-based organisations, a clear sense of member ownership is critical to achieving active and
wide participation. General meetings of the membership, where the concerns of individual farmers can be
heard, and where they are provided with opportunity to inﬂuence the direction of the association, carry
great importance. During the transition phase of the SDP, concentration was placed on building
association leadership, and two meetings of the general Assembly were held annually. NASFAM is now
building depth to the leadership function by strengthening local representation by phasing out the
NASFAM June general meeting (leaving only the Annual General Meeting), and increasing participation
of NASFAM main board, management and stakeholders in individual association meetings. These now
provide an opportunity for direct interaction and information ﬂow between individual members, the
highest levels of leadership / management, and stakeholders.

It is also key to active participation that members can trust those that manage their association and its
ﬁnances. Internal checkers are elected from amongst the membership and trained in simple audit
procedures, so that ﬁnancial transactions and the association’s books of account can be monitored on a
regular basis. This system is complimented by the work of NASFAM’s Audit and Financial Systems
Unit (AFSU), which conducts quarterly audits, and presents the ﬁndings thereof to association boards,
and NASFAM management. At the Annual Meeting, full audited ﬁnancial statements are presented to
the assembled membership. In FY2004, almost all of such audit reports were unqualiﬁed.

7.3 Association Capacity Building

The poor state of rural services and infrastructure signiﬁcantly hinder business start-up and growth.
NASFAM has to date constructed ofﬁce, warehousing and shop facilities at 17 of its associations,
bringing association staff, marketing facilities and farm inputs closer to the farmer, and a secure housing
for ofﬁce equipment and records. With Norwegian support, equipment was provided in Mchinji and
Karonga for the grading of groundnuts and milling of rice respectively. These initiatives have added
value to the smallholder produce and offer improved returns to the membership.

Capacity building is at the core of NASFAM’s programmes. During the current phase of the SDP,
NASFAM has provided the following training to its varying target groups:

Committee Strengthening Training Workshops
Internal Checkers and Treasurers Trainings
Association Management Training
Bookkeeping Training

Association Regional Workshops

Board leadership and Governance

Agriculture Extension

Team Building

Farmer to Farmer Training of Trainers

7.4 Improved Systems Performance

7.4.1 Expansion

NASFAM is built on the principles of collective bargaining and action, and as it is able to continue to
grow, so NASFAM’s bargaining power and potential to realise improved beneﬁts from economies of
scale increases.

NASFAM membership has grown from 14,000 at its inception in 1997, to 105,000 by 2004. In the same
year, NASFAM smallholders marketed over US$18 million worth of cash crops. In 2003, they became
the largest single trader on Malawi’s auction ﬂoor, and they are now the biggest exporter of Malawi’s
Birdseye chillies, with exports to strict European markets. NASFAM has also brought smallholder
produce such as rice and groundnuts to the shelves of quality retail outlets, securing extra return and
access to more stable end markets. NASFAM is recognised as a major force for organisation of
smallholder diversiﬁcation efforts in groundnuts, paprika, soya, pigeon peas and cotton. NASFAM
members have also started growing other crops such as pulses and cassava, bringing improved household
food security.

The following table shows the increase in production and marketed volumes for NASFAM’s major crops
from 2001 to date.

Growth in the NASFAM membership base has been achieved at two levels, firstly through existing
Associations expanding to include adjacent areas, and secondly through moves to new areas, such as the
recent establishment of Associations in Nkhotakota and Ntchisi, both in Malawi’s Central Region.

7.4.2 Quality Improvement

Quality is an important determinant of price, and thus the return to individual farmers. By finding better
markets for the same product, it may be possible to increase the price obtained slightly, but by improving
the quality of the product, sizable increases may be achieved. NASFAM set up its crop production
function in mid-2003, and has steadily expanded its crop production extension services since that time.
Since early 2003, NASFAM has worked with ICRISAT to develop comprehensive procedures for
reduction and tracking of aﬂatoxin (a toxin created by a fungus) in groundnuts (peanuts), and two
containers of nuts were accepted in the UK in early 2005, meeting the most demanding European
standards. NASFAM’s Mchinji Association was also “fair trade” accredited in 2004, and the nuts sent to
the UK attracted a fair trade premium of around 25% above normal market price.

55

NASFAM’s network of farm supply shops has continued to grow, from eight to fifty-two. These shops
serve three important roles. Firstly, and most importantly, they help ensure the right inputs are available
to farmers close to hand, at the times they are needed. Such input availability is a prerequisite to
production of quality crops. Secondly, where possible, they provide inputs at a lower price that other
rural outlets (where such exist). And thirdly, they provide a source of income for member associations,
contributing with their sustainability.

NASFAM’s experience in association formation and development is unique, and this special experience
is captured in its training resources which is used as part of the development process. NASFAM was able
to deliver association strengthening training courses to ﬁve external organisations during the two years
2003 and 2004.

7.5 Expanded Technical Programming

7.5.1 Information Dissemination

NASFAM farmers need access to timely and accurate information to inform their choices, in terms of
markets, prices, services, and important new developments. Over the past three years NASFAM has
made significant improvements in its ability to collect and disseminate information. With the services of
a VSO volunteer programmer, NASFAM has refined the programming for an extensive database of
information at individual smallholder, association, national and international levels to form a powerful
resource for monitoring, evaluating and planning for the entire NASFAM system. This also provides the
data framework to support NASFAM COMMERCIAL marketing efforts and food security efforts.
NASFAM’s comprehensive database of information on NASFAM members and general agricultural
statistics, including household production, income, food security status, will be of utility far beyond the
NASFAM system.

NASFAM has traditionally used radio and publications to disseminate the information it collects.
NASFAM now carries its “farming as a business” message to the broader smallholder community
through its 0an intemally-produced, bi-weekly radio programmes.

7.5.2 Productivity Improvement

The NASFAM membership includes a significant number of experienced and knowledgeable farmers,
who collectively form a large technical resource. In a pioneering move in Malawi, NASFAM has tapped
into this resource as it has used these farmers to train fellow farmers in crop husbandry in a peer-to-peer
programme. Under the title “Farmer-to-Farmer”, this training programme has reached thirty thousand
members, using two thousand farmer-trainers, covering two-thirds of the Associations. Results have
already been reported in areas such as Balaka and Rumphi where the programme has contributed to a
doubling of membership, and a notable increase in production volumes.

7.5.3 Policy Involvement

As the largest member-owned farmer organisation in Malawi, NASFAM has maintained its position as
the “voice of the smallholder”. Through aggressive and proactive advocacy initiatives on behalf of the
smallholder community, NASFAM has inﬂuenced taxation policies, crop pricing, the operational policies
of the banking sector, and smallholder lending practices. NASFAM has contributed to the formulation of
such key government policies as the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy, Malawi Growth Strategy,
Malawi’s Food Security Policy, Irrigation Policy, Competition Policy and the Ministry of Agriculture
Core Function Analysis.

As well as pushing policy agenda determined by its 0an membership, NASFAM has made the views of
the smallholder community accessible to the policy formulation arena. Invitations for NASFAM to sit on
inﬂuential boards, such as the National Action Group, have evidenced the credibility and respect that
NASFAM commands, and provide unparalleled opportunity to direct policy at the highest level.

In 2004 NASFAM brought together approximately 150 stakeholders from Malawi and its neighbouring
countries to come up with an action plan to address the challenges that farmers face. For each of the four

56

priority areas of food security, marketing, rural services and infrastructure, and HIV/AIDS and gender,
recommendations specifying responsible organisations and timeframes were developed and participants

signed formal pledges of commitment to action. NASFAM is now working actively to enforce these
pledges.

57

SECTION 8: IMPLEMENTATION AND REPORTING

This section looks at the management and implementation plan that NASFAM will follow to meet
objectives set out in this proposal

8.1 Management Plan

The operating framework for NASFAM is illustrated as the NASFAM Business System in graphic 1. As
can be seen, all parts of the NASFAM system operate under the direct supervision of NASFAM
Corporate and the NASFAM Board of Directors, which are elected directly by NASFAM associations.
While NASFAM Commercial and NASFAM Development were structured as separate companies with
different functions, they operate within the overall corporate system under a unified management.

8.1.1 NASFAM Corporate
NASFAM Corporate will oversee the rest of the system while also providing the system with technical
support services of finance, administration, human resources and IT.

We feel the major issue facing NASFAM Corporate during the proposal period is to build and operate an
empowered management structure for the entire system. This will have increasing capacity to carry out
NASFAM functions through strong regional operations, each able to interact with and work effectively
with NASFAM Commercial and NASFAM Development. The concept is for NASFAM Corporate to be
able to oversee operations of the entire system supported by an effective Management Committee. By
supporting strengthened regional operations, NASFAM will move its service delivery activities closer to
the Associations, thus increasing fast and profitable delivery of services to members.

In terms of technical support services provided by NASFAM Corporate, the Finance Unit will be
responsible for financial oversight of the entire system, including the separate financial systems operated
under NASFAM Commercial and NASFAM Development. It will also provide support for the NASFAM
audit functions, which report directly to the Board of Directors. Under the proposal period, NASFAM
will play a larger role in monitoring and reporting periodically on all of financial indicators. There will
be considerations for how NASFAM can increase and deepen its monitoring and auditing functions,
which depending on how things develop, may include an AFSU unit focused on auditing head office
functions and increasing the AFSU staffing in the field.

With regards to Human Resources and Administration functions, these units will continue to be
responsible for provision of organisational and personnel administration and development across the
entire system — from all of NASFAM Corporate units located at head office to regional offices and
associations. It is planned that Human Resources will also play a larger role in providing training and
support to Regional Offices, AMCs and Associations, as well as for Head Office staff. It will focus
upgrading and rolling out personnel functions, including updating or preparation of job descriptions,
quarterly and annual performance reviews and the setting up and managing a system for employee
recognition based on achievement of results. Also to be designed and introduced early in the proposal
period is a system which will be used by Associations to reward performance and allegiance based around
a Code of Practice.

8.1.2 NASFAM Commercial

NASFAM Commercial provides full services to the system in the areas of commodity trading, product
development and commercialisation, integrated marketing programmes, wholesale and retail sales
programme development, and crop financing. To support its ability to provide services and work in direct
arrangements with business and financial institutions, NASFAM Commercial maintains a separate
financial system.

NASFAM Commercial will work directly with the managers of NASFAM Regional Offices and their
affiliated AMCs to support their ability to develop regional commercialisation plans. This will define
things such as targets for crop production commodities and volumes, approaches to implementation and

58

support of Farm Supply Shops, arrangements for regional operation of equipment leasing centres, design
of irrigation programmes and development of regional value-added schemes. Implementation of this
approach will facilitate the ability of the system to design coordinated activity at the regional level and to
work at both national and regional levels where there is advantage to be obtained.

As NASFAM enters SDP II it will move away from direct procurement and return to its earlier practices
of brokering member input requirements with reputable organisations, thereby still passing on the beneﬁts
of economies of scale and competitive prices. In addition, distribution of subsidised fertiliser based on a
coupon system will provide a source of income for the Farm Supply Shops. While the system will earn
less, its risk of ﬁnancial exposure also will be signiﬁcantly less, and NASFAM Commercial can
concentrate its energies on increasing earnings from its core business of crop marketing and other lower
risk sources.

8.1.3 NASFAM Development

NASFAM Development will continue to support the entire system by taking the lead role in
communications, monitoring and evaluation, policy and advocacy, training and community development.
It will oversee the ﬁnancing of development support, ensuring appropriate application of donor funds,
develop a grant-making programme and grant-management capacity. NASFAM Development will also
oversee other core development functions including crop production and business and institutional
development, functions that will now operate more directly at regional level than to date.

NASFAM Development will play increasingly important roles in positioning NASFAM Programmes
with development partners and in assisting AMCs to develop programmes, identify sources of funding
and report on results. It will work directly with Regional Managers and AMC Managers to support
development of regional programmes which outline plans and requirements for institutional development,
associated training and capacity building activities. NASFAM Commercial will assist Regional Ofﬁces to
identify areas where they need access to jumpstart ﬁnancing to support introduction of new activities and
will assist AMCs to package proposals for ﬁnancing. On behalf of the entire system, when the overall
NASFAM work plan is put into place, NASFAM Development will be responsible for developing
capacity building programmes in other areas of the system.

To support its ability to attract and operate donor programmes in support of system development,
NASFAM Development also operates a separate chart of accounts so that it can show each donor how its
funds have been used and with what result.

8.1.4 Decentralised Operations
As part of NASFAM’s move toward sustainability, Regional Managers are now part of the NASFAM
Management Committee, the system’s major operational decision-making body.

Regional Managers now also have the mandate and responsibility to develop regional programmes
tailored to the needs and demands of the members in their regions. Regional Managers will work with
AMC management and their afﬁliated Associations to prepare regional development portfolios which will
provide the major building blocks for the system. NASFAM’s overall institutional work plan will be
developed on the basis of plans presented within these regional portfolios and approved by the
Management Committee. Regional plans will detail the approaches that will be used to guide set up and
operation of increasingly proﬁtable AMC programmes. The system-wide plan will identify the speciﬁc
ways in which Head Ofﬁce - NASFAM Corporate, NASFAM Commercial and NASFAM Development -
will provide support to the regional portfolio development and implementation.

8.1.5 NASFAM Associations

NASFAM Associations remain the foundation for the entire NASFAM system. While operation within
new regional programmes will lend to the attractiveness of the NASFAM system, the growth potential of
the AMCs depends directly upon the strength of individual associations. Associations will put their
business models (shown in graphic 2) into place in conjunction with the AMCs to which they are
afﬁliated. The Associations will increase services to members by designing and carrying out new

59

programmes around, for example, development of pilot irrigation schemes and/or marketing of produce to
local outlets. They will work in partnership with AMCs and their NASFAM Regional Office to identify
and develop opportunities for improved productivity and yields, for example by making new equipment
available and/or by leasing and farming larger tracts of land as an association.

The foundation for implementation of the association business model is laid as Regional Managers, AMC
managers, Association leaders and representatives of NASFAM Corporate, NASFAM Commercial and
NASFAM Development meet to discuss and agree on programme priorities for the year. They will
decide, among other things, what kind of irrigation schemes would make sense within their system, what
kinds of crop targets will be set, what kinds of training they will need, how many Farm Supply Shops
should operate within the AMC network and what kinds of arrangements will be put into place at national
and regional level to support proﬁtable operation. Once they have formed plans for their Associations and
their AMC, they will identify and set targets for recruitment of members, and they will review and agree
upon the fee structure which is appropriate.

8.2 Systems Coordination

8.2.1 Systems Coordinator

As shown in the NASFAM business system graphic, a Systems Coordinator will function directly as an
advisor to the Chief Executive Officer. The person holding this position will be responsible for
monitoring system progress against the planning approaches and targets put into place by this strategic
plan, by development support programme commitments, and by work plans at all levels of the system.
This position is specifically aimed at encouraging and supporting coordination among all aspects of the
system. In order to maximise the benefits of this role, if possible, the position will be held by an
individual who is familiar with all aspects of the NASFAM system, aware of the special opportunities and
challenges facing each part of the system, and of the advantage to be gained through cooperation and
coordination.

8.2.2 NASFAM Management Committee

The NASFAM Management Committee (ManCom) is the highest operational level of decision-making
within the NASFAM structure. It is presided over by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and includes the
heads of key NASFAM units as shown in the NASFAM business system graphic 1.

The Management Committee will meet at least monthly at an agreed and standard time and its role will be
to:

- Provide an ongoing forum for negotiation and decision-making with regard to allocation of
corporate resources

0 Ensure that all plans, donor agreements, etc in place throughout the system are introduced and
implemented in keeping with commitment to NASFAM corporate culture and focus on
smallholder capacity building

- Approve regional programmes and agree on roles for each unit in support to such plans

0 Develop annual work plan system, organisation targets and budgets for presentation to the Board
of Directors

- Review monthly progress from each unit of the organisation against work plans,

0 Identify and address issues that affect the entire organisation

0 Take decisive action to address problems and take advantage of opportunities,

- Hold periodic briefings on progress with the Board of Directors.

0 Ensure a full annual review and assessment of progress against the SDP, examining reasons
behind progress in order to guide organisation development of strategies for meeting KRAs and
objectives for the following year.

0 Ensure a mid-term review of the Strategic Development Plan, after year 2 or 3, to establish if
KRAs and objectives need to be changed.

60

Terms of reference for ManCom’s roles and responsibilities will be developed in the first few months of
the proposal period in order to ensure effective and transparent operation. The terms of reference will
include the following points:

0 ManCom deliberations will be carried out under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer, who
is responsible for making final decisions in cases of disagreement among members of the
Management Committee.

0 Decisions made by ManCom are binding on the organisation, therefore, all decisions will be
documented in writing and the minutes from each meeting will contain a record of positions taken
by committee members.

0 Decisions made by ManCom will be those of either organisation wide relevance or of key
importance to specific operations. (Under the decentralisation programme, Regional Managers
will have the authority to make decisions that are relevant to activities exclusively within their
regions that have no organisation-wide impact.)

0 Minutes of ManCom meetings will be kept in the CEO’s file. An overvier of the deliberations of
each monthly meeting (minus specifics of personnel and other such confidential matters) will be
circulated throughout the NASFAM system, no later than the end of the week following the
ManCom meeting.

0 The CEO will reserve the right to bring matters that are of particular significance to the Board of
Directors for consideration. Any unusual circumstances will be dealt with according to the Terms
of Reference for the operation of ManCom.

8.3 Management and Monitoring of Change

NASFAM will ensure that organisational and programme changes are implemented with the following
support structures and mechanisms.

NASFAM is focusing on improving communication and information ﬂow throughout to help to ensure
that all parts of the system know what is going on, and get the right information at the right time in order
to perform towards the KRAs and objectives. In addition, NASFAM will focus on improving information
sharing fora, such as the management of meetings and cross-functional working, to ensure that successes
and challenges are shared on an ongoing basis.

To ensure that all parts of NASFAM are working towards the same goals, consistent annual workplan and
budget templates will be used throughout the system. Each operational unit e.g. head office function,
AMC, Regional Office etc, will produce their 0an workplan detailing the activities and programmes that
they will implement during the following year. These will be consolidated into one departmental
workplan for each of the three Head Office companies and the three regions. In turn all of these siX
workplans will be collated into one NASFAM operational plan and budget for that financial year. This
will be the first time that NASFAM will have an annual operational plan for the whole system, and will
help to ensure thorough assessment of progress against the SDP goals during the implementation of that
plan.

All workplans, whether unit, department or for the whole organisation, detail the staff members involved
in delivering each activity undertaken to achieve each objective. A key worker will be allocated to each
activity, as well as identification of other staff directly involved, which will form a “contract” of who
needs to be kept updated and involved on each activity, with the key worker responsible for ensuring this
happens. This will help to tackle previous problems of staff not knowing what is happening on projects
they are involved in or impacted by, particularly in terms of strengthening the communication bridge
between Head Office and the field. The emphasis will be on developing good project teams and cross-
functional working to ensure that activities are delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible.

To mirror the consistent workplan templates, all parts of the NASFAM system will report on a quarterly
basis on a standard report template. As all workplans are now structured around the same NASFAM SDP
objectives, each quarterly report will instantly provide a snapshot assessment of actual achievements
against targets, providing a headline picture of progress against strategic and annual plans.

61

Quarterly reports will be reviewed by ManCom to ensure any issues and problems are addressed as they
arise. In addition, at the end of each year, ManCom will instruct a detailed assessment of progress against
objectives. This will inform on areas which are working well and those which are not, and thus require a
change in strategic direction in the following year in order to move towards achieving strategic goals and
objectives.

The strategic context in which NASFAM operates is subject to change in terms of weather patterns
affecting crop production, inﬂuences on markets, particularly in terms of export, and shifts in
Government focus and policy on agriculture. Therefore when embarking on a five year plan, it is
important to acknowledge that there may be changes during that period that impact on the goals and
objectives of the organisation. Therefore, in year two or three of the proposal period there will be a mid-
term review of progress to date. This will be a fully comprehensive assessment of NASFAM’s operating
context as well as progress against each KRA and objective, with the aim of establishing whether the
objectives need to be changed in order to meet the KRAs.

The final initiative to ensure that change is managed and monitored under is the implementation of a
revised staff performance review system. This will now link into the quarterly reporting process, so that
each member of staff will have an assessment of their performance in tandem with reporting progress
against objectives. This will assist in keeping staff motivated and focused as well as ensuring that the
organisation and its staff are regularly reviewed to ensure challenges are being met and to keep NASFAM
moving towards achievement of the SDP 11 goals and objectives.

8.4 Technical Committees

NASFAM’s SDP 2001-2006 included plans for the formation of two technical advisory committees to
support the commercial and development companies. An advisory committee was brought together to
review the activities of NASCENT, however in practice the committee did not function well because of
lack of clarity in regard to its roles and jurisdiction, and also in part due to its membership.

During the first part of 2007, and as directed by plans set out in its latest SDP (2007-2011), NASFAM re-
visit this area and will move to form technical advisory committees first for NASCENT and then for
NASCOMEX with a small but strong team of individuals serving on each. A clear terms of reference will
be developed and individuals selected based on their interest and willingness to serve the smallholder
community.

It is envisaged that the committees will review workplans and reports and give both general and specific
guidance to the Board of Directors and technical staff in regard to programme implementation.

SECTION 9: RISKS AND ASSUMPTIONS

NASFAM management suggests the following risks and assumptions underlie successful achievement of
outcomes under the proposal.

Member Loyalty

Assumption: members will exhibit loyalty to the system, in selling their crops, in procurement of inputs
and services, from Association shops or through other collective arrangements, and in payment of
membership fees.

Risk: To the extent that members are not loyal to the system, marketing volumes may be undermined,
with resulting losses in revenue streams. Also, service programmes (such as crop transport programmes)
which rely on the beneﬁts of an orderly process and efficiencies of scale may break down, economies will
be lost and service providers will become redundant.

Working Capital

Assumption: Sufficient working capital will be found and available to (i) procure member produce in the
quantities and at the time it is available from members for sale and (ii) procure inputs in economically
viable quantities at the time required.

Risk: If insufficient working capital is available, members may sell crops (from necessity) outside the
system resulting in (i) required crop volumes will not be achieved, (ii) member loyalty will be
undermined (see above), (iii) input supply may breakdown.

Weather
Assumption: Generally weather patterns are not unduly unfavourable to crop production.

Risk: Harsh weather conditions may undermine crop production resulting in low quantities and/or poor
quality of crops. This will reduce member income, reduce system income, negatively impact on customer
relations, increase the possibility of supply of sub-standard produce, undermine efforts in stringent
markets (e. g. European groundnut markets), reduce buying power of members to secure adequate inputs
for next season, and increase member food security.

Funding

Assumption: Donor funding ﬂows will be available at projected levels. In particular in the short term,
USAID funding will remain in place at currently committed levels till 31 March 2007. NAC funding will
be in place in 2006.

Risk: Disbursement of USAID funding has already been slowed down a little during 2006. Should there
be a further slow-down of cash ﬂows from USAID this would reduce technical and financial support to
Associations during the critical planting season of late 2006.

Exchange Rate
Assumption: The local exchange rate will move steadily and in a systematic manner, broadly in line with
market forces.

Risk: A failure for the currency to depreciate in line with market forces depresses the value of donor
funding vis-a-vis increasing local costs.

Human Resources

Assumptions: (i) NASFAM will retain, or replace with equally or better qualified individuals, the services
of key management positions. (ii) Staff retention in general will be reasonable good. (iii) Funding (donor
or otherwise) is sufficient to maintain competent people in these key management positions. (iv)
NASFAM institutionally replaces the technical capacity in terms of commercial strategy which has until
recently been offered by the System Adviser.

65

Risk: The availability and commitment of a highly competent staff and management is a key success
factor for NASFAM. Any disruption with the management and key staff may negatively affect the
efficient and effective operations of the NASFAM system.

Political Interference
Assumption: That government will reverse recent trends of market interference and building up of state-
owned corporations (e.g. ADMARC), and revert to promotion of a liberalised economy.

Risk: Such activities as price setting, buying produce at uneconomic prices, and provision of inputs
through state-owned mechanisms, all undermine NASFAM’s ability to perform, which is based on
commercial, competitive principles.

Political Stability
Assumption: Malawi will maintain relative political stability.

Risk: As well as undermining the general operating environment, political instability may undermine
donor confidence and result in political-motivated changes.

Risk Mitigation

In order to mitigate the possible effects of the identified risks, NASFAM will have a strategic focus on the
following relevant key areas:

0 Strive to increase the membership base and members loyalty as this will make the NASFAM
system less vulnerable to changes in crop production and marketing,

0 Promote drought resistant crops in order to reduce the risks of low crop production and increased
food insecurity during years with low rainfall,

0 Promote low cost and simple irrigation systems for alternative crops as well as for increased food
security,

0 Secure working capital support to NASFAM Commercial by developing a sound and viable
business plan and a strategy for the farm input supply shops,

0 Develop and implement dynamic HRD and career plans for management and staff and maintain
the image of being a respected and attractive employer, and

0 Continue its efforts in lobbying government and other stakeholders for an enabling business
environment conducive for the private sector development in Malawi.

ANNEX 2: FIVE YEAR CROP MARKETING STRATEGIES - 2006-2011
Background Information

NASFAM Commercial has been assisting farmers to market their produce for the past 10 years with a fair
amount of success. The crops traded were mainly birds eye chillies, groundnuts, rice, soya beans and
various types of legumes. It has also assisted in production and marketing of about 15% of Malawi’s
burley tobacco.

The lessons learnt through this period and the gaps identiﬁed in both supply and demand of commodities
and processed products have enabled NASCOM to come up with the crop strategies contained in this
document.

CORE CROPS

Generic Strategies for Core Crops

NASFAM Commercial has designated the following crops as core crops and will aim to achieve and
consolidate a market leadership position with the assistance of NASFAM associations. Market leaders
beneﬁt from economies of scale and derive decent margins by being able to set prices when their market
leadership is substantial.

Estimates For 2006 Marketable Production And Market Leader Quantities For Nasfam’s Core Crops thl

Crop Marketable Prod Min Market Leader Vol.
1. Kilombero Rice 6,000 2,000
2. Birds Eye Chillies 600 250
3. Groundnuts 30,000 5,000
4. Soya Beans 50,000 6,000

Crop Specific Strategies for Core Crops

The strategies below look at each core crop and explain how that crop will be handled to provide
maximum returns to NASFAM farmers and NASFAM Commercial. The strategies are in order of
importance of the crop in terms of revenue.

1. Kilombero Rice Strategy

Introduction

Kilombero Rice belongs to the Oryza sativa species and is a larger type of rice with a characteristic
pleasant aroma. The rice is grown in Karonga and parts of Southern Tanzania under rain fed production
with little irrigation capabilities being developed. At about US $900 /MT retail price, the rice commands
a price of more than 3 times of cheaper varieties from Asia in Malawi, due to its superior quality.

Objective of the Strategy

Our objective is to consolidate and develop the product as the cash cow of the company. We aim to be to
be the undisputed leader on the Malawi market and the ﬁrst company to seriously tap the regional market
and even beyond. This will provide NASFAM members and indeed all other Kilombero rice farmers
reliable markets at good prices.

Production and Marketing Strategies

1) Production Strategy

A fair estimate of current production that can be available for marketing in Malawi is about 6,000 MT
paddy of which NASFAM buys around 1000 MT. We plan to position NASFAM as the only
unquestionable source of genuine Kilombero rice coming directly from farmers. NASFAM should

therefore gear itself to produce and market at least 2,000 MT of paddy to attain market leadership in
Malawi. NASFAM will move from 980, 1,030 and 1,250 MT in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively,
towards the planned target of 2,000 MT. Once regional markets have been identiﬁed, this production will
have to be increased to about 4000 MT, most likely through enhanced irrigation, to respond to orders
from the main cities of Southern and Central Africa.

2) Processing Strategy

The milling of the rice will still be done at the Karonga Mill whose capacity at 1,000 MT a month is more
than adequate to respond to market needs. The milling will be done in 30 MT batches to preserve the
aroma of the rice giving not less than 60% yield of milled rice.

3) Target Market

Primary target market for Kilombero long grain rice is Malawi’s middle to upper class families and
expatriates with monthly income exceeding US $600 per month. Secondary markets include upmarket
institutions like hotels, restaurants and private schools. Exploratory work on exports to main cities in
Southern Africa like Lusaka, Harare, Gaberone, Johannesburg and Cape Town will be conducted in 2007.

4) Product Strategy
Milled rice has to be graded to produce the following products :-

l. Polished long grain rice (99%) packed in the following pack sizes
50 kg WPP printed sacks
25 kg WPP printed sacks with handle
10 kg 120 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags
5 kg 100 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags
2 kg 80 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags
1 kg 80 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags
500g 80 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags

2. Unpolished long grain Kilombero rice 5 kg 100 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags

Standard Broken Rice packed in the following packets

a. 50 kg WPP printed sacks

b. 5 kg 100 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags
c. 1 kg 80 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags
d. 500g 80 MIC Polyethylene 6 colour printed bags

DJ

4. Flavoured Broken Rice packed in the following packets
a. 50 kg Broken Rice with salt, sugar and milk powder
b. 1 kg Broken Rice with salt, sugar and milk powder

5. Rice Bran which account fro about 40% of the paddy will be sold as follows :-
a. Chaff to be packed into 150 kg sacks and sold to dairy farmers and feed manufacturers in the
Northern Region.
b. Rice husks to be turned into briquettes for providing fuel for domestic cooking.

5) Promotional Strategy

Kilombero rice is a premium product that has to be marketed to upmarket customers who are quality
conscious people willing to pay a high price for a quality product. The promotional activities will include
the following :-

Outdoor advertising

Celebrity endorsements

Product tasting in retail outlets
Fares and exhibitions

Radio, print and TV advertisement
Donations to charities

99:593.”?

82

6) Distribution Strategy
Kilombero Rice will continue to be distributed to the top 10 retailers in the urban centres of Malawi such
as PTC, Shoprite, McConnel, Seven 11 and others.

A pilot run on home delivery will be done from 2007 in selected areas of Mzuzu, Lilongwe and Blantyre.

7) People Strategy

A graduate Commercial Manager will manage Kilombero Rice assisted by a commodity ofﬁcer and
Regional Commercialisation Ofﬁcers. A sales incentive scheme will be in place to motivate sales staff at
all levels in order to get better customer service and sales revenue from this product.

8) Pricing Strategy

NASCOM will determine the price as market leader and the most credible source of the product. Proﬁts
above budgets will be ploughed back into the product and incentives for farmers, to improve yields and
quality. The following indicative prices are suggested subject to market conditions:-

Farrn gate Price Paddy US $300 / MT
Ungraded Milled Rice US $600 / MT
Milled Super Rice US $900 / MT
Standard Broken Rice US $400 / MT
2. Birds Eye Chillies Strategy
Introduction

Birds Eye Chillies (Kamphiripiri) is species of small chilli that is bright red in colour and of very hot
taste. The chilli is grown in Mulanje, Nkhotakota, part of Mozambique and Tanzania under rain fed
production with a little irrigation being developed. At about US $4000 /MT, the chilli is a high value
crop and perceived to be of high quality in Europe and America.

Objective of The Strategy

NASFAM Commercial plans to consolidate and develop the product as the no 1 foreign exchange earner
of the company. The strategy will be to be the undisputed leader on the Malawi market and be the ﬁrst
place of call for all major buyers of chillies in Europe and the region. This will provide NASFAM
members and indeed all other chilli farmers in Malawi reliable markets at very good prices.

Production and Marketing Strategies

1) Production Strategy

A fair estimate of current production that can be available for marketing in Malawi is about 600 MT of
which NASFAM buys around 200 MT. The plan is to position NASFAM as the only unquestionable
source of genuine chillies obtained directly from farmers. NASFAM should therefore gear itself to
produce and market at least 300 MT of chillies to attain market leadership in Malawi. It will start moving
towards this target from 140, 175 and 210 MT,respectively, from 2007 to 2009. Once value adding
initiatives have been fully explored and developed, production will have to be increased most likely
through irrigation.

2) Processing Strategy

Hand grading of chillies will have to be monitored carefully to produce aﬂatoxin-free product of grade A
and B quality. A chilli powder making plant has to be explored in 2007 with possible commissioning in
2008.

3) Product Strategy

Birds eye chillies will be sold in the following pack sizes
a. Grade A and B to be exported in 20 kg Jute bags packed in 20 foot and 40 foot containers.

83

b. All local sales to be in WPP bags.
c. Chilli powder to be in 100 MIC Polyethylene bags between 500g and 20 kgs as per customer
requirements.

4) Target Market

Birds eye primary market is Europe where NASCOM has an agent able to market 20 containers a year. A
secondary market is South Africa, while research to market chilli powder will be reveal whether this
becomes the primary market or not.

5) Promotional Strategy

Product brochures will be used to give details of the product to prospective buyers who fall under
industrial markets. Other strategies required in industrial markets, such as well maintained website,
commodity exchange, business visits and exhibitions will be creatively utilised.

6) Distribution Strategy
Product will be shipped straight from NASFAM associations to both local and international customers.

7) People Strategy

A graduate Commercial Manager will manage birds eye chilli assisted by a Commodity Officer and
Regional Commercialisation Officers. A sales incentive scheme will be in place to motivate sales staff at
all levels in order to get better customer service and sales revenue from this product.

8) Pricing Strategy

Birds eye chilli is a buyer’s market so NASCOM will have to exhaustively search for the prevailing
market price for each and base its price on that information. For planning purposes, the following
indicative prices will be used as base figures:-

Normal Production Year

Farm gate Price US $1200 / MT
Grade A FOT Price US $2500 / MT
Grade B FOT Price US $1800 / MT
Powder US $6000 / MT
Low Production Year
Farm gate Price US $1500 / MT
Grade A FOT Price US $4000 / MT
Grade B FOT Price US $2000 / MT
3. Groundnut (Peanut) Strategy
Introduction

Groundnuts fall under the species Arachis hypogea with several subspecies differentiated in size, colour,
oil content and other characteristics. In Malawi, the main varieties being promoted are CG 7 and
Chalimbana groundnuts. In the early eighties Malawi, mainly through ADMARC, is said to have been
exporting 80,000 MT of groundnuts to Europe. NASFAM has done quite a lot of work on both types of
groundnuts in order to resurrect exports to Europe. In 2004, NASFAM exported its first container to
Europe to the Fair Trade network.

Objective of the Strategy

The strategy of NASFAM Commercial on groundnuts is to build the quality of groundnuts being grown
while at the same time increasing the volumes marketed to 4000 MT by 2011. The major challenge on
groundnuts will be meeting the stringent aﬂatoxin requirements for the European Market. The fair trade
market needs to be increased to the 1000 MT mark in the next 5 years to provide stable and sustainable

84

market for groundnuts. The regional markets will look for volumes exceeding 10,000 MT a year at
prices 1 0-20% lower than currently the case.

Production and Marketing Strategies

1) Production Strategy

A fair estimate of current production that can be available for marketing in Malawi is about 30,000 MT of
which NASFAM buys around 1,200 MT. With the help of ICRISAT, NASFAM can manage the aﬂatoxin
problem, common in tropical groundnuts, and revive exports to Europe in thousands of tons. The crop
grows well in Mchinji, Lilongwe , Kasungu and Mzimba districts. The strategy will therefore be to
promote expansion of groundnut production to farmers that are not beneﬁting much from tobacco
production. Intensive extension work will be done to teach farmers good agricultural practices that reduce
aﬂatoxin affecting the farmers’ crop. Introduction of the Spanish type of groundnuts in 2007-8 season
after concluding market research would enable NASCOM access newer markets.

2) Processing Strategy

Hand grading of groundnuts will continue to be monitored carefully and improved to produce aﬂatoxin-
free product. Machine sizing capacity will have to be increased from 7 MT in 2006 to 30 MT a day in
2011 to provide customers with several product options. In order to do this, NASFAM plans to access
another groundnut sizing machine in 2007. Handling of crusher grade groundnuts will have to be given
emphasis to reduce wastage from grading operations.

3) Product Strategy
The main products of groundnuts are CG7, Chalimbana and Msinjiro.

CG7 groundnut is an improved variety of medium size and higher oil content. It is roasted and crushed
into making peanut butter bread spread and also roasted for confectionery.

Chalimbana is a lesser yielding variety of a bigger size but lower oil content. It is ideal for ‘up market’
confectionery products and is very good for longer shelf life peanut butter.

Msinjiro is an improved Chalimbana variety which gives higher yields, is slightly smaller and can be used
as like chalimbana in all respects.

These 3 varieties can be sold as follows
a. Farmers stock in 50 kg WPP bags
b. Hand Picked and Sorted stock in 50 kg WPP bags
c. Graded Groundnuts as per customer requests on Kernels Per Ounce basis and other relevant
specifications
Aﬂatoxin based qualities from 0 — 20 ppb.
‘Farma Nuts’ branded hand selected nuts in 2 kg 6 colour 100 MIC polyethylene packaging.
Groundnut Cake for animal feed.
Crude Cooking Oil
Refined Cooking Oil

wormg

4) Target Market
The principle market of groundnuts is processors in the region and in Europe. Secondary markets are
local consumers of groundnuts, cooking oil and livestock feed processors.

5) Promotional Strategy

The promotional strategies of groundnuts at NASFAM Commercial will have to emphasise on the quality
of the nuts in being low in aﬂatoxin. This will be done through use of the Elisa test or HPLC methods to
analyse samples of farmer members’ produce.

85

‘Farma Nuts’ branded raw nuts will be promoted together with Kilombero rice in supermarkets and trade
fairs.

Cooking oil and groundnut cake are new products whose strategies will be developed in 2007 for
implementation in year 2008. Emphasis of promotional messages will be on import substitution and
creation of wealth in the rural areas.

6) Distribution Strategy

Groundnuts will continue to be purchased in NASFAM association market centres with funding from
NASCOM Commercial. After hand grading and analysing for aﬂatoxin, the groundnuts will be loaded for
the export market in 30 MT loads.

Farmer nuts will be centrally graded and packed at NASFAM Commercial’s Lilongwe warehouse where
deliveries to retail outlets will be controlled.

The cooking oil proposal once developed will contain details on wholesale and retail promotional
strategies of the new product.

The groundnut cake strategy will be a ‘business-to business’ deal relying on sales personnel to make sales
calls to big dairy estates and livestock feed processors.

7) People Strategy

A graduate Commercial Manager will manage groundnuts assisted by a commodity officer and regional
commercialisation officers. A sales incentive scheme will be in place to motivate sales staff at all levels
in order to provide better customer service and obtain increased sales revenues from this product.

8) Pricing Strategy

Farmers stock groundnuts will have to be priced at the market prices normally set by international buyers.
Graded and branded products will be priced at below current market prices in order for NASFAM
Commercial to penetrate the market.

4. Soya Strategy

Introduction

Soya bean is a glycine max species with several varieties grown in Malawi under rain fed cultivation. In
Malawi, the crop has seen an increase in production mainly due to the resurrection of chicken production
as well as installation of new machinery for oil extraction at Central Poultry Ltd. It is very likely that
more uses of soya like for making soya mince and bio-diesel will drive production of soya in the future.
However, it must be noted that the farm gate price for the past 4 years of between US $120 and US $200
is preventing soya traders to export soya beans to the Region or beyond due to high prices.

Soya beans are produced in most parts of the country with moderate to cool climatic conditions, and
where rainfall is medium to high. The commonly grown varieties include Viking, Ocepar4, Soprano, and
Solitaire, all of which are Open Pollinated Varieties, and have oil and protein contents of between 20 and
40%.

Malawi has the potential to produce up to 300,000MT of soya beans annually but is currently producing
less than 50,000 MT. A small part of this volume is exported within the regional markets and the bulk of
it is used to produce animal and human food on the domestic markets. Processing for human food mainly
as Corn Soya Blend is however on a relatively smaller scale.

NASFAM Associations such as Mzimba South, Lilongwe North, Kasungu and Mchinji are the key
production areas for soya.

Objective Of The Strategy

The strategy of NASFAM Commercial on soya is to develop a stable demand base by identifying and
working with key processors who are traditionally net importers of the commodity. The major constraints
on soya are that it has limited uses locally. It also has ﬂuctuating demand with low margins realised from
sales. The region as a whole is a net importer of the product as well. To realise bigger margins on the
product the key would be to ﬁnd “new” uses for the product such as processing it further to make
nutritional food such as soya mince.

Production and Marketing Strategies

1) Production Strategy

Increase production in associations through extension services and input supply of certiﬁed high yielding
seed varieties. NASFAM members plan to produce 1,700, 1,850 and 2,000 MT in 2007, 2008 and 2009,
respectively.

2) Processing Strategy

There is need to procure processing equipment and/or to link up with processing ﬁrms in production of
value added products such as soya mince. Warehouses with enough capacity to hold produce over longer
periods should also be localised in association areas, ready for delivery to markets and/or processing
plants after the price has gone up towards the end of the season.

3) Product Strategy

Raw soya will be bought in big volumes and sold in 50kg standardised bags to local processors. The idea
is to minimise the working capital cycle as the margins are low and deal in bulk contracts with local
buyers.

Soya mince and bio-diesel uses for soya to be explored in detail in 2007 for possible launch of value
adding ventures.

87

4) Target Market

The principle market of soya is food processors on the local market. Brokers who buy for resale are also
another market segment. There is need to also target exports markets if the volumes and margins are
justiﬁable. The government and NGO sector can also buy for their distribution programmes to the needy.

5) Promotional Strategy
Personal Selling techniques will be used to negotiate joint venture agreements on soya processing with
major regional and international players.

6) Distribution Strategy
Soya will continue being procured from associations where it shall be standardised and supplied directly
to local processors and traders.

7) People Strategy

A graduate Commercial Manager will manage soya assisted by a commodity ofﬁcer and Regional
Commercialisation Ofﬁcers. A sales incentive scheme will be in place to motivate sales staff at all levels
in order to get better customer service and sales revenue from this product.

8) Pricing Strategy

Domestic market will be offered soya at the upper median range price of between US $250 and US $300
per tonne, ex-warehouse. Farm gate prices should stabilise within the US $145-US $180 price band. If
farmers increase their yields they will make more revenue at US $120 / MT farm gate price which is the
exportable price of soya to the region.

Soya Prices:
Normal Production Year Low Production Year
Farm gate Price US $145 /MT US $180 / MT
FOT Price US $200 / MT US $215 / MT

NON-CORE CROPS
5. Sesame

Introduction

Sesame (Sesamum indicum) grows in hot areas and is widely used in the confectionery industry. Malawi
uses less than 200 tons most of which is imported from neighbouring countries. The international market
for sesame is undersupplied every year, making it a good developmental crop for NASFAM.

Seed production started in year 2005 in which 5 MT was grown. It is expected that in 2007, NASFAM
will harvest 100 MT of sesame for the local market by which time a complete study on international trade
would have been done.

Production Strategy
The strategy of NASFAM is to continue seed multiplication and introduce more members to sesame in
readiness for entry into the world market once studies have been completed.

Processing strategy
Sesame would be harvested, cleaned and bagged in export quality bags.

Target Buyers

Primary buyers of sesame will be local bakeries, some of whom have shown willingness to sign forward
contracts. The secondary market is South African commodity traders and eventually traders further
overseas when production has reached thousands of tons.

88

Product Strategy

The strategy will be to work with farmers to produce a very clean crop that will be stored carefully to
minimise post harvest losses. Being a new product, packaging will be restricted to 50 kgs for industrial
customers.

6. Paprika

Introduction

Paprika Capsicum annuum is a relatively new crop in Malawi, having been introduced in the past 10
years. It is used in the food industry as a food colourant and over 1000 MT are grown in Malawi. There is
only one major buyer who offers around US $1 / kg and exports the crop to Europe. NASFAM has tried
promoting the crop but farmers want a farm gate price above US $1.40 per kg.

Production Strategy

To increase volumes NASFAM has to do contract farming which are matched by forward contracts based
on a market demand and price assessment. There is need to provide inputs to the farmers since paprika
relies heavily on fertiliser and chemical applications like ammonium nitrate that is vital for leaf
development and increases the crop's tolerance to disease and pest attack.

Given current demand where there is one credible buyer, our production target should be between 100
and 150mt. Creating contracts where growers receive phased payments for production to an agreed
quality standard, can be an incentive for farmers to buy approved chemicals, and NASFAM can give
them the cash to do so. NASFAM can go a step further by buying the inputs themselves, and distributing
them in appropriate quantities. NASAFM can gain further control of what it buys by supplying certiﬁed
seed. This can help farmers to get higher yields, while also ensuring that NASFAM gets a more uniform
product and hence one that will fetch a better price.

Processing strategy

Paprika procured should be well graded and dried to improve on quality. NASFAM can also add value to
paprika by grinding it and selling it as powder. It can also be extracted for Oleoresin and other extractions
though the extraction cost is, reportedly, quite high.

Target Buyers
Whilst scouting for regional and international buyers NASFAM should maintain their existing
relationship with the current buyer, Cheetah Ltd..

Product Strategy

Because paprika is heavily dependent on its colouring it needs to be bought at the right time i.e soon after
harvest and delivered before it loses its colour. Equally important are good storage methods. Strong
plastic bags or sealed metal containers will protect a crop from beetles, moths and other insects far more
effectively than traditional jute sacks.

Pricing Strategy
The powder will be sold at US $2 DDU Europe and North America while the Oleoresin price will be
determined by agents who will market the product for us.

7. Pigeon Peas

Introduction

Pigeon peas Cajanus caj an is in the group of legume crops and is found in two varieties, brown and white
varieties. The pigeon pea is grown in Southern part of Malawi, a few districts in the centre and the
Northern part of Mozambique. Pigeon pea is currently selling locally at about US $220/MT delivered
buyers’ warehouse. Whole pigeon peas have not yet fetched an export market because of the low prices
offered by both regional and international markets.

89

NASFAM commercial would now like to consolidate on pigeon peas and do some value adding for sale
at a proﬁt for the company. The strategy will be to win at least a 16% share of the Malawi market and
produce dhal (split beans) for the Middle East market. This will provide NASFAM members and the rest
of farmers in with Malawi reliable markets.

Production Strategy

Traditional farmers currently do the Pigeon peas production and in a traditional organic way; no fertilizer
or any other chemicals are applied to the pigeon peas. Pigeon peas production is usually an ‘intercrop’
with other crops such as maize.

Processing Strategy
Hand grading will have to be monitored carefully for the pigeon peas that will be sold whole. It will be
advantageous to establish a partnership with processors for dhal making.

Product Strategy
Pigeon peas will be sold in the following pack sizes
a. Whole pigeon peas packed in a 50kg Polyethylene bags to be sold locally at 10% max profit
margin. Volume should be maximised for profit.
b. Toor dhal packed in 50kg Polyethylene bags to be sold on export market at 20% profit margin.
c. Toor dhal packed in 1kg plastic bags to be sold on retail markets at 30% profit margin.

Target Market
Toor dhal making should be focused on the Middle East market through direct sale or partnership. The
toor dhal branding should be considered for the retail as well as the secondary market.

8. Chick Peas

Introduction
Chickpeas is also in the group of legume crops and it is found two varieties; brown and white varieties.
The chickpea is grown in the Southern part of Malawi and the Northern part of Mozambique.

NASFAM commercial would now like to consolidate chickpeas and do some value addition for sale at a
profit for the company. The strategy will be to win at least 15% share of the Malawi market for food
supplements for sick persons and children. This will provide NASFAM members and the rest of farmers
in Malawi with a reliable market.

Production Strategy

Just as in pigeon peas production, traditional farmers currently do the chickpeas production and in a
traditional way; no fertilizer or any other chemicals are applied to its production. Modern agronomic
practices will have to be promoted when export markets have been identified.

Processing Strategy
Hand grading will have to be monitored carefully for the chickpeas that will be sold whole. Since this will
be a new crop; value addition should be looked at 2 years into the introduction of the crop.

Product Strategy

Chickpeas will be sold locally as whole packed in 50kg Polyethylene bags at a 10% (maximum) profit
margin. Volume should be maximised for profit. Processing into food supplements will be contracted out
from NGOs involved in health initiatives.

Target Market

Chick peas markets should currently be focused on large local buyers whilst efforts should be put in place
to establish export markets within and outside the region.

90

9. Cow Peas

Introduction
Cowpeas is also in the group of legume crops and it is found in two varieties; small and large varieties.
The cowpea is grown in Central and Northern parts of Malawi.

NASFAM commercial would now like to consolidate cowpeas for sale at a proﬁt for the company. The
strategy will be to win at least 30% share of the Malawi market. This will provide NASFAM members
and the rest of the farmers in Malawi with reliable markets.

Production Strategy

Just as in pigeon peas production, traditional farmers currently carry out cowpea production and in a
traditional way; no fertilizer or any other chemicals are applied to its production. Cowpea production is
usually an ‘intercrop’ with other crops such as maize.

Processing Strategy
Grading and cleaning (HPS) will be the only way of value addition to cowpeas; in the short term. Hand
grading will have to be monitored carefully for the cowpeas to make it look uniform.

Product Strategy
Cowpeas will be sold locally as whole packed in 50kg Polyethylene bags at 10% max proﬁt margin.
Volume should be maximised for proﬁt.

Target Market
Cowpeas markets should currently be focused on large local buyers whilst efforts should be put in place
to establish export markets within and outside the region.

10. Sorghum

Introduction

Sorghum is in the group of grain crops and it is found in several varieties including red variety. Sorghum
is grown in all regions in Malawi. Red sorghum is increasingly gaining demand more especially from
brewers.

NASFAM Balaka is currently producing about 400MT of red sorghum and have the capacity to do up to
600MT. NASFAM Balaka is currently selling on its 0an to Chibuku Products Ltd. NASFAM
Commercial would now like to consolidate the red sorghum for sale at a proﬁt for the company. The
strategy will be to win at least 25% share of the Malawi market. This will provide NASFAM members
and the rest of farmers in Malawi with reliable markets.

Production Strategy

Traditional farmers currently do the sorghum production and in a traditional way; no fertilizer or any
other chemicals are applied to its production. Sorghum production is also done by intercropping it with
other crops such as maize.

Processing Strategy

Hand grading and/or winnowing will have to be monitored carefully for the sorghum to remove non-
Sorghum related materials. Sorghum is vulnerable to pests and as such needs to be procured and sold
within a month.

Product Strategy

Sorghum will be sold locally as whole packed in a 50kg Polyethylene bags at 10% max proﬁt margin.
Volume should be maximised for proﬁt.

91

Target Market
Sorghum markets should currently be the local brewers whilst efforts should be put in place to establish
export markets within and outside the region.

1 1. Sugar Beans

Introduction
Sugar beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)is one of the bean varieties produced through out Malawi. Sugar beans
are grown in all regions in Malawi. There is a good demand from the region but at lower prices.

NASFAM Associations are currently producing beans along with their main crops and have the capacity
to do up to 300MT. NASFAM Commercial would now like to consolidate the sugar beans for sale at a
proﬁt for the company. The strategy will be to win at least 20% share of the Malawi market. This will
provide NASFAM members and the rest of farmers in Malawi with reliable markets.

Due to a big diversity of bean varieties, farmers are shunning some varieties and producing those that are
high yielding and are probably being campaigned for by some donor funded organizations. Sugar beans is
one of the affected varieties and is produced in low volumes.

Production Strategy

Traditional farmers currently do the beans production and in a traditional way, no fertilizer or any other
chemicals are applied to its production. Beans are produced twice in Malawi; rain fed and as a winter
crop. Emphasis should be put on a campaign to woo farmers to produce sugar beans. Contract farming is
a solution to accessing reliable volumes as well as obtaining a standardized farm gate price.

Processing Strategy

Hand grading will have to be monitored carefully for the beans to remove non-Sugar Bean related
materials. Beans could be bought during the season, kept in stock and sold later. Sugar beans should be
for regional export market and could be shipped as soon as a load is ready.

Product Strategy
Sugar beans will be sold whole, packed in 50kg Polyethylene bags.

Target Market

Sugar beans markets should also be for export markets within and outside the region at between US $500
and US $700 per MT, FOT.
