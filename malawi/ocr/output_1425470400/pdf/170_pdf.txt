The A08 has 2 main traditional sources of funding viz the Malawi Government and cooperating
Embassy and Irish AID. The Bureau has also in the

partners mainly DFID, the Royal Norwegian
past received financial support from the European Union under the Rule of Law Program and

the United States Government.

The Irish Aid commenced its funding to the Bureau in December 2009 under a financing
agreement which was signed with the Malawi Government. The main focus of the funding from
Irish Aid has been to support the implementation of the National Anti—Corruption Strategy with
particular focus on the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Local Government and Local councils.
The Irish Aid plans to formally join the pool funding to the A08 which currently supported by
DFID and the Royal Non/vegian Embassy for an initial 5 year period in June 2011 at the

commencement of the new strategic plan for the ACE.

1.1 SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT IRISH AID PROGRAM.

The current program that is being supported by Irish Aid since December 2009 has enabled the
A08 to deepen its participation in some key National programs mainly the FISP. The support
has also enabled the ACE to expand its district programs by increasing engagement with Local
CounCIls, traditional leaders and communities. With the support from Irish Aid the Bureau was
able. to monitor the FISP to ensure that it was conducted in a corrupt—free manner. The ACE co-
faCIlitated some briefing sessions at which it was able to sensitize key staff involved in FISP on
corruption issues. The ACB has also planned some forums targeting MoAFS ADD staff that

form part of the frontline in the implementation of FISP.

Tc augment this process, the ACB has also strengthened its partnership with ADMARC through
which the subsidized inputs are accessed. The ACB signed an MOU With ADMARC last year
and is implementing a program supported with funds from EU and DFlD/Norway. The support

from Irish Aid has facilitated the bridging of these 2 facets of the FISP.

The support from Irish Aid has enabled the ACB to investigate a significantly higher number of
cases of alleged corrupt practices in the implementation and management of the FISP than was
the case in the past years. Previously the number of investigations that were being conducted
was lower in part because the available funding had to be shared with other investigations
which the ACB conducts and hence it could not suffice. The increased numbers of
investigations will result in increased deterrence and also pinpointing areas of weakness in the
FISP which are then communicated to the MoAFS for remedial action to be taken.

Apart from increasing the number of cases, the support has also assisted the ACB to broaden
the scope of cases involving FISP to include malpractices during registration and even
procurement. This year the ACB has already investigated successfully some cases involving
ghost villages and the findings were shared with the MoAFS for their action and they have duly
acted on them. The role of the ACB in this year’s FlSP has been acknowledged by both the

MoAFS and the media thanks to the support from lrish Aid.

The programs also enabled the ACB to engage with a cross section of Traditional leaders from
across the country. Traditional Leaders play a very important role in the FISP programs and
other development programs of Government. However in recent years statistics based on the
2005 Governance and Corruption survey, Newspaper reports and the complaints that the ACB
receives have shown a worrying trend of more Traditional Leaders being involved in corrupt
practices in the implementation of some key national programs such as the FlSP, Malawi Rural
Development Fund (MARDEF) and the Youth Enterprise Development Fund (YEDEF) and other
development programs. This has potential to derail development.

As a direct result of these interactions the ACB facilitated the establishment of a National forum
and some 3 Districts forums for chiefs that will provide a platform for Traditional Leaders to
participate in the implementation of NACS. One of the Senior Traditional Leaders has gone a
step further to facilitate establishment of Community integrity Committee in the villages under
his authority. The Bureau has trained the committees with funding from lrish Aid and is providing
technical support to assist them roll out village anti-corruption programs. The interactions with
the Traditional Leaders and the subsequent programs that have been planned for
implementation have enabled the ACB to be seen by the Public as being responsive to

problems of national concern.

The support from lrish Aid enabled the ACB to facilitate the development of Corruption
Prevention Policy Frameworks at Blantyre and Lilongwe City Councils and is in the process of
doing the same for the Ministry of Local Government, Ministry of Agriculture and some 8
selected Local Counciis. The ACB further undertook a sensitization campaign that targeted over
70% of staff in the Blantyre and Lilongwe City Councils.

Besides these successes, the program supported by lrish Aid was at times interspersed with
some teething problems. Implementation of the program commenced at a slow pace. This was
initially attributable to the fact that the ACB had to first establish partnerships and rapport with
the MoAFS and MoLG and then subsequently the lle that had been formed. Partnerships and
rapport take time and require patience especially coming against a background that the ACB
had to assuage any doubts and suspicions in the minds of people in these 2 ministries about its

5 l

 

 

 

celerated mainly after the OPC issued a circular requiring

intentions. However progress later ac
formation of lle.

The Bureau later in the year found it difficult to implement programs in the Ministry of Agriculture
especially in the months of September and October 2010 because the Ministry was heavily
involved in FISP. This has slowed down the implementation of programs raising the risk that
some funds may not be spent. This However is still a probability and not a certainity. The key
lesson that the ACB has drawn from this challenge is that in 2011 a bqu of the programs
involving MoAFS will be implemented at least by September 2011 so that October to December

will largely focus on the monitoring of the implementation of the FISP.

The Bureau was unable to implement the Lessons and learning component which required a
review of the 2009 FlSP. The ACB established that similar processes were also planned and
implemented by the MoAFS itself and Cooperating Partners mainly, the Royal Norwegian
Embassy. As such the ACB felt it would be a duplication of efforts. As an alternative, the ACE
participated in the review which was done by the MoAFS and contributed its input in that
process. The funds which were earmarked for this process will therefore not be spent. The key
lesson that has been drawn from this experience is that more consultation will need to be done
before such activities are put in the Budget. This is already being implemented in that the
activities that have been put in this proposal for the MoAFS have been derived from their Anti-
Corruption work plan which was drawn up through a consultation process with their “C. The
ACB has also decided to focus more on the review of systems and procedures relating to the
FlSP as a way of augmenting the other review that is done of the FlSP.

The procurement of lEC Materials especially T-shirts, Golf shirts and Billboards have been
slower than planned. This has mainly been due to several factors such as delays by Banks to
provide the successful bidders with the financing for the contracts due to red tape and forex
challenges, capacity challenges of the bidders to deliver according to schedule and delays by
City councils to allocate land for erecting Billboards. However all the matters are under control
and are expected to have been discharged by Mid November 2010. To prevent recurrence of
these problems the ACB has tightened the eligibility criteria by among other things requiring that
firms submit letters from their Bankers certifying their financial soundness and also introducing a

post-qualification component to the evaluation criteria.

There is overreliance by the target institutions such as MoAFS, MoLG and Local councils on the
ACB to finance all activities. So far only Lilongwe City Assembly was able to agree to a cost-
sharing arrangement for some activities. This situation has resulted in a bigger component of
the budget from Irish Aid being devoted to Accommodation, Fuel and Allowances resulting in
concerns being raised by Irish Aid. The reluctance by institutions stems from the fact that they
did not have budget lines for the activities that we were facilitating and as such are constrained
by the resource envelope at their disposal and also because Government has not yet worked
out a mechanism for providing funding to Public Institutions to support implementation of NACS.
The challenge is that such overreliance threatens the sustainability of the programs and efforts
which are being rolled out in the institutions. This issue will however be best resolved when the
NIC is operationalized since the Office of the President and Cabinet will chair this oversight

committee.

1.2 BRIDGE FUNDING IN RELATION TO THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS AND
THE NACS

The operations of the ACB at a strategic level are governed by strategic plans that are
developed from time to time. The ACB developed its first Strategic plan in 1996. In 2004, a
fresh strategy was developed but not implemented. Between that time and 2007 the Bureau
was developing one year plans which provided the basis for support from cooperating partners
A new strategy was developed to run from 2007 to 2011. One of the key elements of this
strategic plan was to champion the development of a National Anti—Corruption Strategy which
would cover institutions and activities much wider than that of the ACB, and would seek to

support the whole National Integrity System in Malawi.

The strategy stemmed from the result of a Governance and Corruption Baseline Survey which
was commissioned in 2005 by the ACB with support from DFID and the World Bank to ascertain
the nature and extent of corruption in Malawi and assess public perception of the problem. The
survey found that a majority of Malawians consider corruption to be a big problem in Malawi.

As a follow up therefore to this survey the Bureau facilitated a process involving all sectors of
the society in Malawi which culminated into the development of National Anti-Corruption
Strategy initiative which was meant to provide an effective platform for harnessing collaborative

efforts of all sectors to effectively and collectively fight corruption in Malawi.

The strategy was launched by the state President on 5th February 2009 and is currently being
implemented. The focus of the Strategy is the establishment of a National Integrity System
based on eight sectors viz: Executive, Judiciary, Legislature, Civil Society, Faith Based
Community, Private Sector, Traditional Leaders and the Media. The goal of the National
Integrity System is to eliminate corruption in all sectors of Malawian society in order to improve

service delivery.

The strategy is in effect a National Policy document which provides a comprehensive framework
within which programs and interventions to address corruption in Malawi should be designed,
developed, implemented and managed. Amongst the priority areas that the ACB has focussed
in the roll out of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy is Traditional Leaders. This has also
extended to District Councils which are entities that closely work with the Traditional leaders.
This focus has mainly been supported by the current Irish Aid program. With the roll out of the
strategy now underway, the ACB has embarked on a process to develop a new strategic plan
which will govern its operations from June 2011 to 2016.

The new strategic plan is expected to continue focusing on the provision of a framework for
supporting the implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. Traditional Leaders and
local councils will continue to be one of the priority areas In line with previous studies that have
done which have shown the desire by the General Public for the AC8 to extend its reach to
districts and communities. The new strategic plan for the ACB will therefore in part augment the
decentralization process by providing a framework and platform for developing and
implementing programs that will entrench transparency. accountability, good governance and
integrity in local councils and communities.

The Malawi Government has already approved a new revised staff establishment as envisaged
in the current strategic plan which has among other things increased the capacity of the Public
Education Section to enable it expand its programs especially those targeting Traditional

7 I

 

Leaders and Districts Councils. The new establishment has also increased the capacity of the
Corruption Prevention Section to enable it extend the roll out of the National Anti-Corruption
Strategy to among other key areas, District Councils. The roll out of programs has already
started under the current program supported by the lrish Aid and this is being augmented by

filling of the new positions which is underway.

The New Strategic Plan will provide a framework for expanding the reach of the ACB programs
to District Councils and also expanding the programs targeting traditional leaders. This will
therefore provide a platform and framework for support from cooperating partners and provide a
better entry point for new partners such as lrish Aid whose focus is to support the
implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. However the transition to focussing
more on the District Councils and Traditional Leaders got underway under the current project.
The new strategic plan will mainly accelerate that process through provision of the framework
and thus the bridge funding will for now sustain the transition and preparatory process.

2.0 THE RATIONALE OF THE PROJECT

The Bridge funding is necessary to sustain and accelerate implementation of the programs that
have been rolled out so far under the current program and also support the process of ensuring
that these programs begin to make a tangible and positive impact on the target institutions and
the livelihood of the communities in areas where they are being implemented. This will only be
possible if bridge funding is provided to cover the period January to June 2011. The need for
bridge funding has also been necessitated by the reduced levels of funding from existing
arrangements with cooperating partners which the ACB has experienced in the 2010/11

financial budget.

The reduction has meant that the new programs that were rolled out from December 2009 with
support from Irish AlD cannot be accommodated under current levels of funding from existing
arrangements and since they are already underway, it would not be prudent to suspend them
until June 2011 when lrish AID is expected tojoin the pool funding. Suspension of the programs
in the absence of any new funding between January and June 2011 would result in gains that

have been made so far diminishing and eventually being lost.

Bridge funding to cover the January to June 2011 is also necessary to enable ACB effectively
participate in some key national programs such as the preparatory activities for the 2011 FISP.
The key activities under FISP that fall under this period includes registration of beneficiaries,
conducting sensitization campaigns, participation in coordination and planning meetings,
training frontline staff in the MoAFS, reviewing some key FISP-related systems and procedures
to secure improvement, completing investigations and prosecution of some key cases involving
the 2010 FISP and also following up any complaints that can be reported under the 2011 FISP.

The lnvolvement of the ACB in the 2011 FlSP will be crucial to improving the Governance in the
Farm lnput Subsidy programme (FlSP). This program is aimed at helping to achieve food
security in the country through subsidizing the cost of farm inputs and fertiliser to the targeted
poor populace. Through a proactive approach and also implementing some preventive
measures and other programs and interventions the ACB’s participation will be crucial to
promoting transparency and accountability and minimizing corrupt practices in the management
and general governance of this program.

The absence of any new funding between January and June 2011 will make participation by the
ACB in the 2011 Local Government Elections impossible. The involvement of the ACB in the

es that elections are an important milestone in efforts to build a democratic,
stable and peaceful society. It also realizes that elections associated With corrupt practices have

the potential to derail any efforts to realize democracy. stability and peace and that this in turn
derails any national development programs. it is upon this realization that the ACB intends to
utilize part of the proceeds from this project to contribute to efforts to guarantee corrupt-free
Local Government polls and also empower citizens and other key stakeholders with information

that will enable them play their role in ensuring corrupt free elections.

The Bureau realiz

d under the current project has focused on the implementation of the
trategy with particular focus on Traditional Leaders and Local councils
in addition to MoAFS and MoLG. The new strategic plan which will be in place by June 2011 is
scheduled to give more focus to these areas. As such, the bridge funding under this proposed 6
months project will in the interim sustain and expand the programs that are being rolled out
whilst simultaneously transitioning the programs supported by lrish Aid since December 2009 to
effectively integrate into the new arrangement and framework which will be ushered in by the

new strategic plan which is being developed.

Lack of support between January and June 2011 can potentially derail the programs that are
being implemented now to strengthen good governance, transparency and accountability in
Local Councils. Local councils have a pivotal role to play by among other things acting as
conduits through which resources can be ploughed into communities which they serve to ensure
development and improved livelihood. Working with Local councils and building their human and
system capacity to effectively detect and prevent corruption and also enhancing the integrity of
their staff will strengthen local governance and help the councils provide quality service delivery
to communities but also ensure that the little resources they have will be maximized for the

greater good of the communities.

3.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM

The project aims to support the implementation of NACS thereb ' '
I i ' . _ y ensure that its goal of creatin
a National integrity system is achieved. This will strengthen efforts to realize the vision of thg

ACB which is to create a corrupt—free Malawi.

The overall objective of the project is to enhance the c '
I I ' apaCity of the ACE, Local Councils
MoAFS, MoLG and other target institutions and stakeholders to effectively and efficiently

implement the NACS. This will be achieved through the following interventions:

 

" Sustain and deepen existing programs and interventions supported by Irish Aid and facilitate

their transition to the new strategic plan framework which will commence in June 2011.

b) Promote integrity in Local Councils. MoAFS. MoLG and other target institutions and

stakeholders through supporting the implementation of NACS activities,

Increase the levels of awareness on corruption issues and the NACS amongst staff in the

target institutions, their stakeholders and the general Public and other.

d) Strengthen accountability and Maximize deterrence from corrupt practices amongst
Government officials, communities, traditional leaders and other stakeholders in the FISP,
Local Councils and amongst traditional leaders through undertaking effective investigations,
prosecution and surveillance operations,

e) Strengthen whistle-blowing mechanisms for corruption and also improve access to these in
local councils and other target Institutions.

f) Support the conduct of transparent, accountable and corrupt-free Local Government

elections.

4.0 SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

This project will consolidate and entrench the progress registered in the first project funded by
Irish Aid which started in December 2009 and will end in December 2010. It will also extend
efforts to mainstream the implementation of NACS in the MoAFS with specific focus on the ISP
and also in the MoLG with specific focus on Traditional Leaders, Local councils and their

stakeholders and communities.
5.0 SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES

The following are the specific activities which will be implemented in the project:
5.1 Support the implementation of NACS Me MoAFS.

Under the current program funded by the Irish Aid, the Bureau facilitated the establishment and
training of an MC in the MoAFS. The Bureau further facilitated the development of an Anti-
corruption action plan within the framework of NACS and is also currently implementing a
sensitization program for Ministry of Agriculture staff in all its ADDs as part of activities to
forestall corruption incidences in the 2010 FISP.

Under the new program the A08 will provide technical and financial support to the NC in the
MoAFS to facilitate implementation of key activities outlined in the Anti-corruption action plan
and scheduled for implementation between January and June 2011. This intervention will assist
in consolidating the progress that has been achieved so far in the Ministry.

Particular attention will be given to finalization of the draft Corruption Prevention Policy to
provide a robust framework within which other activities can be effectively implemented. The
ACB will work with the NC to ensure that there is wide consultation involving staff and key
stakeholders in the development of this Policy framework to enhance ownership of the

document.

The activities in the MoAFS will be implemented at Headquarters and ADD levels. The activities
will in part be tailored to prepare the staff for the 2011 FISP by specifically addressing the
corruption-related challenges that were faced in the 2010 FISP and preventing their recurrence

in the 2011 FISP.

The ACB will work with these 6 councils as well those already targeted under the existing
proiect (Le. Blantyre and Lilongwe City Councils) to among other activities facilitate the
development of Corruption Prevention Policies. The Policies will be developed in a collaborative

and participative way and will provide a framework for enhancing detection and prevention of
corruption and also promoting good corporate governance in the target local councils. These
programs are expected to stretch beyond the current financial year into the 2011/2012 financial

current project. the Bureau recently held a forum funded by lrish Aid to engage with a cross—
section of Traditional Leaders to sensitize them on corruption issues and explore the role they
can play in the implementation of NACS. The forum proposed the establishment of a national
forum for chiefs to coordinate a program that will facilitate the involvement of Traditional
Leaders in the fight against corruption and also implementation of NACS. The forum further
agreed to facilitate setting up of district forums within the NACS framework.

The ACE under this program will engage Traditional Leaders to participate in the
implementation of the NACS and prevention of corruption in the FISP program. The ACB will
organize another forum for senior Traditional Leaders coming from areas that did not participate
in the first forum so that they also provide input into the draft framework that was proposed at-
the first forum. The ACE will then facilitate the completion of the framework to enable the
development of a program based on which this proposed Traditional Leaders forums at both
national and district levels will operate. The A08 will facilitate the establishment of an initial 3
pilot traditional leaders’ forums in the 3 out of 6 Local Councils that will be targeted under this
program. The other 3 forums will be established in the 2011/2012 financial year based on the
results of the review of the functioning of the 3 pilot forums. The forums will be trained and
develop programs for implementation in their communities. The ACB will involve Anti-Corruption
Clubs based in the 3 Local Councils and other key stakeholders in implementing this program.

5.7 Undertake Surveillance and investiqation activities to deter or respond to corrupt
practices.

The ACE will undertake surveillance activities in selected districts to monitor the implementation
of the FlSP and ensure that all processes are being done in a transparent and accountable
manner. Considering that this project will run until June 2011, the surveillance activities will be
limited to the registration process and other preparatory processes that will done by the MoAFS,
ADMARC, Traditional leaders etc. However considering also that the project will commence
soon after the 2010 FISP, the Bureau will undertake investigations into all outstanding
complaints that were received in the just ended FISP so that the outcomes can be used to
develop specific recommendations to be submitted to the MoAFS to assist in improving the

2011 FISP.

5.9 Purchase of Equipment.

The A08 has received assistance in this area from the Malawi Government and other
cooperating partners in the past. Under this project, the ACE also plans to use part of the
proceeds from this program to purchase a Heavy duty Photocopying Machine to support the
implementation of the program. The Photocopying machine will bring the much needed relief to
the current ageing photocopying machines which need frequent maintenance and some are at

the verge of obsolescence.

5.10 Direct and indirect Costs

To support implementation of these programs the ACE will also require funds which will support
maintenance of the vehicle purchased under the current project. Furthermore the ACE will
require some funds for purchases of stationery items and some consumables to support the

implementation of activities under this project.
6.0 TIME FRAME
The program will be implemented from January 2011 to June 2011.

7.0 MONITORING AND EVALUATION

The program will be monitored by management of the ACB through the quarterly reports that
are circulated to all cooperating partners including lrish Aid. The Cooperating partners will
discuss the report with management of the ACE through quarterly ACE/Development Partners
meetings. Activities in the program will also be monitored through the National Integrity
Committee since they will fall under the implementation of NACS. The Bureau will maintain a
database of complaints received involving the two Ministries to monitor the impact of the project.
