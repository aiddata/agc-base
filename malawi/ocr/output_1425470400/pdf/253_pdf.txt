Executive Summary

Agricultural production forms the hub of the Republic of Malawi’s economy with the majority of
smallholder farmers dominating the sector, cultivating on pieces of land not more than one
hectare on average. Over the years, the majority of the smallholder farmers have been unable to
produce enough food to meet their annual energy requirements due to a number of factors
including unfavourable weather conditions resulting in ﬂoods and/or dry spells, high input prices
and to some extent increased pressure on the same pieces of land leading to degradation and loss
of soil fertility.

Since the onset of rains in October 2007, the Republic of Malawi has been affected by heavy
hailstorms, ﬂoods as well as dry spells (southern region). The biggest impact has been on
agricultural production. The impact of the ﬂoods and hailstorms necessitated the United Nations
(UN) in Malawi to come up with an appeal that sought assistance from donor community to
support the Government of the Republic of Malawi to respond to the needs of the affected
households. The appeal was based on the Government of Malawi/UN Flood Contingency Plan
figures under the second scenario. However, there was general concern on the figures that
eventually started coming in from the districts affected by the ﬂoods. The Government of Malawi
therefore, commissioned an assessment with technical and logistical support from the UN and the
Malawi Red Cross Society. According to this assessment which was carried out parallel to the
Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), 22 707 households have had their
agricultural activities affected and will need immediate assistance in order to re-engage in
agricultural production and sustain future livelihoods.

One way of achieving this is by improving farm productivity through intensiﬁcation and
diversification of the farming systems of smallholder farmers. Recently, best practices have
been observed through the promotion of pulses and root crops which act as substitutes to the
staple crop maize and are drought tolerant. The project will be implemented in close
collaboration with district agricultural offices in order to ensure ownership and follow up. Being
a ﬂood response project, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA) will be
heavily involved. The project’s intended outputs are:

0 increased food production of 11 200 households who have lost their crops and other
productive assets due to ﬂoods;

0 improved access by the ﬂood affected households to quality maize seed through direct
distribution;

0 280 tonnes of fertilizer, 28 tonnes of improved maize seed and 16 800 packets of assorted
vegetable seeds procured and distributed to 5 600 affected households in Nsanje,
Chikwawa, Zomba and Mangochi districts by the end of the project;

0 improved access to planting materials of appropriate locally adapted varieties (including
cassava cuttings, sweet potato vines and legumes for crop diversification; and

0 capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MoAFS) to coordinate and
facilitate agricultural emergency interventions improved.

The targeted districts are Nsanje, Chikwawa, Mangochi and Zomba. Other affected districts have
been left out due to logistical reasons as well as limited resources. The project will target
11 200 households in traditionally ﬂood affected districts. Half (5 600) will be targeted for
irrigated agriculture while the other half will be targeted for crop diversification on the

assumption that not all affected households will have access to enough residual moisture or
perennial streams to support irrigation activities. However, if there are more households with
access to enough moisture per district than targeted, the project will be ﬂexible to incorporate
them and then reduce on the crop diversification part.

Each beneficiary household will receive 5 kg of improved maize seed, basal and top dressing
fertilizers (25 kg each) and three different types of vegetable seeds. Parallel to input provision for
winter production, beneficiary households will be trained in crop and diet diversification as a way
of expanding their food basket and spreading the risk of food insecurity. Training will be
conducted jointly by the MoAFS with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAQ).

This training will be followed by provision of inputs to facilitate crop diversification. Each
beneficiary household will receive 1 (one) kg of each of the following legumes or any other
combination (deemed appropriate through consultations), ground nuts, beans or pigeon peas and
soya beans; siX bags of sweet potato vines (50 kg by volume) and five bundles of cassava
cuttings. After maturity, the beneficiary households will be required to pass on part of the seed in
a pass on scheme, under the guidance of field technicians who will take into consideration seed
quality, particularly sanitary condition of planting materials so that more households can have
access. These inputs will be utilized during the summer production starting in October 2008.

FAO and MoAFS will submit two narrative quarterly reports and a terminal report within twelve
months of the closure of the project as detailed in the signed Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU). Monthly updates will be prepared separately on request.

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 General context

Agricultural production forms the hub of the Republic of Malawi’s economy with the majority of
smallholder farmers dominating the sector, cultivating on pieces of land not more than one
hectare on average. Over the years, the majority of the smallholder farmers have been unable to
produce enough food to meet their annual energy requirements due to a number of factors
including unfavourable weather conditions resulting in ﬂoods and/or dry spells, high input prices
and to some extent increased pressure on the same pieces of land leading to degradation and loss
of soil fertility. The dry spell conditions of the 2004/05 growing season affected the resilience of
4.2 million people to withstand effects of natural shocks and disasters. The Government of the
Republic of Malawi responded positively, with the assistance of international donor community
and partners, by mounting a massive food distribution exercise that eventually averted famine
and deaths of millions of people. Agriculturally, the Government implemented a targeted input
subsidy programme for 2.1 million households. The outputs of the programme were very
encouraging. The United Nations in Malawi also responded by taking part in the consolidated
appeal process (CAP) to seek assistance from the donor community for rehabilitation and
recovery programmes to which Governments of Ireland, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and
Spain responded by funding a crop diversification project through the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

Parallel to these various small-scale donor responses, the Government of Malawi through the
MoAFS continued with its targeted input subsidies. In 2007, the programme targeted 1.7 million
farming families estimated at a total cost of USD 63 million. According to the first round crop
estimates released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MoAFS), the country is
expecting to have another bumper harvest in 2008 with maize (staple crop) estimated at
3.2 million tonnes. However, despite efforts by the Government in ensuring that smallholder
farming families have improved access to relatively cheaper inputs for improved crop production,
there has been a negative impact on these efforts by the changes in climate and weather. Since the
onset of rains in October 2007, Malawi has been affected by heavy hailstorms, ﬂoods as well as
dry spells (southern region). The biggest impact has been on agricultural production. The impact
of the ﬂoods and hailstorms necessitated the UN in Malawi to come up with an appeal that
sought assistance from the donor community to support the Government of Malawi in response to
the needs of the affected households. The appeal was based on the Government of Malawi/UN
Flood Contingency Plan figures under the second scenario. However; there was general concern
regarding the figures that eventually started coming in from the districts affected by the ﬂoods.
The Government of Malawi therefore, commissioned an assessment with technical and logistical
support from the UN and Malawi Red Cross Society. According to this assessment which was
carried out parallel to the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) assessment,
22 707 households have had their agricultural activities affected and will need immediate
assistance in order to re-engage in agricultural production and sustain future livelihoods.

Overlying climatic and weather problems in Malawi is the HIV/AIDS pandemic coupled with
high levels of malnutrition. Estimated at 14 percent, the HIV/AIDS pandemic poses another
challenge to national efforts of realizing food and nutrition security. As a result, available family
labour for agricultural work is reduced, such that recovery from natural disasters and shock is
more problematic for the affected and infected households.

The Food and Nutrition Policy, in conjunction with the Strategic Framework for the National
Acton Plan for Food Security and Nutrition in Malawi (2005), clearly spells out the need for
supporting programmes of food security interventions that can effectively address the needs of
the resource poor rural households whilst encouraging the commercialization of agricultural
production and the provision of support in rural areas. One way of achieving this is by
improving farm productivity through intensification and diversification of the farming
systems of smallholder farmers. Recently, best practices have been observed through the
promotion of pulses and root crops which act as substitutes to the staple crop maize and are
drought tolerant.

1.2 Scope for early recovery in Malawi

The FAO Emergency Coordination and Rehabilitation Unit (ECRU) in Malawi has been involved
in early recovery initiatives since 2002. Its major focus has been crop and diet diversification,
small-scale irrigation and nutritional education through a garden based learning concept (nutrition
rehabilitation units, home based care groups, school gardens and establishment of Junior Farmer
Field and Life Skills). Over the years, ECRU has cultivated a cordial working relationship with
the Government of Malawi through the MoAFS, Education, Health, Irrigation and Water
Development and Women and Child Development. These relationships have assisted the unit to
reduce costs related to project implementation and supervision. Ownership of projects has been
ensured through involving these government ministries from a designing level through
implementation and supervision.

Early recovery initiatives vary depending on sectors. In agriculture, winter production, training
and provision of inputs form the basis for re-engaging affected households into productive
livelihood activities. In 2007, the smallholder sector produced about 356 015 tonnes of maize and
566 888 tonnes of sweet potatoes through winter cultivation in all agricultural development
divisions. There is high potential for winter production in most affected districts because of the
residual moisture along major rivers.

The ECRU has both the staff and experience in implementing winter production interventions.
By utilizing residual moisture where appropriate as well as river diversion, it is envisaged that
this project will project the right stimuli for the affected smallholder households to improve their
food security. It is the intention of ECRU to ensure that proper coordination and linkages are put
in place to reduce duplication of efforts among different development partners in affected
districts.

1.3 Sectoral context
1.3.1 Development priorities and the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs)

Towards the end of 2006 the Government of Malawi reviewed its Poverty Reduction Strategy
and out of this review, the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) was developed
and was officially launched in July 2007 by the State President. The strategy outlines the national
economic and social development goals to be realized by 2011, it gives development direction to
all development partners including the United Nations. The MGDS is a nationally owned, results-
oriented, medium-term framework. This framework was developed with the view of contributing
directly to the realization of the millennium development goals (MDGs) of the United Nations
especially the first MDG, “Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger”.

In line with the MDGS which spells out development priorities, the country has a number of
related sectoral policies and policy instruments which are aimed at ensuring that different players
have a guiding platform for different initiatives targeted at vulnerable households.

1.3.2 United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)

Based on the MGDS, the United Nations developed the UNDAF which was officially endorsed
by the Government of Malawi and stipulates the contribution of the United Nations System in
Malawi towards realization of the goals of the MGDS and MDGs in the long term. All United
Nations agencies in Malawi are clustered under the following MGDS themes which facilitates co-
ordinated planning, programming and closer collaboration with government partners under the
banner of a “one UN”.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Theme Cluster lead
agency

Sustainable economic development and food security FAO

Social protection WFP

Social development UNICEF

HIV and AIDS UNAIDS

The activities proposed in this project fall directly under Cluster 2 “social protection” which is
led by WFP but FAO has been an active member of the cluster since social protection cut across
all sectors including agriculture. The Malawi UNDAF 2008-2011 document contains detailed
information on individual agency programming, collaboration, joint outcomes and outputs and
monitoring and evaluation plans.

1.4 Sectoral policy and legislation

By official request from the Government of Malawi, two key policies are currently being
formulated:

0 social protection (SP). A comprehensive SP policy document is being developed and
collated (with assistance from UNICEF and the social protection cluster of the UNDAF)
and codified for review and roll out by the Malawi cabinet;

0 an Agriculture Development Programme (ADP) facilitated jointly by FAO and the World
Bank at the request of the MoAFS. The ADP is formalizing a Programme Based
Approach (PBA) which is considered a “watered down” sector-wide approach (SWAp).
The PBA advantage is that donors can choose to align themselves within the PBA
(improving management in the agricultural sector) or remain outside of its remit.

2. RAT I ONALE

2.1 Problems/issues to be addressed

Several key problems exist within the agricultural sector in Malawi. In brief these can be
described as: reliance on mono crops (tobacco and maize); reliance on subsidized inputs, and lack
of crop variety; limited diet diversification leading to chronic levels of malnutrition and high

levels of HIV and AIDS and its impacts. In addition, climate change and rainfall variability is
driving a debate to review and re-consider current and established farming systems.

Changes in climate as a result of global warming have resulted in unpredictable weather patterns.
The agricultural sector has been heavily affected especially in the Southern Africa region. In
2008, the region has experienced heavy rains that have affected agricultural production in many
countries including Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In Malawi alone,
22 707 households had their crops damaged representing 11000 ha. The impact of this wide
spread damage to agricultural activities will be reduced production leading to food insecurity and
malnutrition.

The project will be implemented in close collaboration with district agricultural offices in order
to ensure ownership and follow-up. Being a ﬂood response project, the DODMA will be heavily
involved.

2.3 Project justification

The Southern Africa region has been heavily affected by climatic changes resulting in excessive
ﬂoods and hailstorms which have damaged crops and houses among many other infrastructures.
Malawi has not been spared either, the southern region of the country being the worst affected
with Chikwawa, Nsanje, Mangochi, Phalombe and others registering more than
15 000 households. Considering the high levels of vulnerability and unpredictable weather
patterns and high levels of HIV and AIDS, it is imperative for the FAO ECRU to continue
supporting targeted communities through the MoAFS with initiatives aimed at building capacity
and skills resulting in enhanced resilience to these natural disasters and economic shocks. Despite
bumper harvests in the previous two consecutive growing seasons, Malawi is yet to graduate
from chronic malnutrition and poverty. This is coupled with a regional ﬂood crisis affecting
Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Currently, everything is in place to cost effectively implement agricultural emergency response
activities. The ECRU has built a team of professionals that have been together for some time now
facilitating the implementation of similar initiatives. Throughout this period the team has gained
significant experience and skills, justified by evaluation, that are vital for smooth project

implementation. Networking with other UN agencies has also contributed to reducing costs and
improving on efficiency and efficacy.

Therefore, it is against this background that FAQ is proposing, in line with MoAFS priorities,
other UN agencies and in accordance with its mandate, to assist the ﬂood affected smallholder
farmers with agricultural inputs (seeds and fertilizers) and training that would ensure that the
farmers are able to re-engage in crop production during winter period (April-October 2008) and
build resilience to livelihood shocks in the longer term.

2.4 Past and related work

The current diversity of skills in the ECRU has ensured quality service delivery during project
implementation. During the past five years the ECRU, working closely with government
ministries and within national policy objectives, has targeted three key areas, i.e. small-scale
irrigation; crop and diet diversification and nutrition education (carefully considering and
targeting the most vulnerable especially women, children and orphans).

In 2005/06, the Government of Spain in responding to the ﬂash appeal supported the Government
of Malawi in rehabilitating agricultural livelihoods in Kasungu, Lilongwe and Machinga districts
with inputs and training in small-scale irrigation and crop diversification. Inputs such as
fertilizers and seeds (cassava, sweet potato vines, legumes) were procured and distributed to
10 000 households. Being satisfied by the outputs, the Government of Spain further contributed
funds for similar activities in Ntchisi, Dowa and Eastern Kasungu in 2006/07. During the same
period the Governments of the Republic of Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg also
supported crop diversification initiatives in the lower Shire and eastern region as a result of a
prolonged dry spell that hit the country at that time.

During 2006-07, the Republic of South Africa supported the Government of Malawi’s efforts,
through:

0 small-scale irrigation and training and equipping households with equipment for
developing more sustainable community based gravity fed irrigation schemes and
improved agronomic practices and crop diversity;

0 nutrition education and improved agronomic practices, targeted households, nutrition
rehabilitation units (NRUs), primary schools and home based care clubs. They received
training in gardening (production, preservation and preparation) using primarily
indigenous vegetable crops. Recipients/graduates of training received start up kits to
ensure replication at household level. This initiative has targeted women in NRUs, HIV
and AIDS affected, primary school children and orphans;

0 the livestock sector which has been assisted through improving transboundary disease
control and surveillance through modern technology, i.e. digital pen technology.

In 2008 the Government of Spain has supported scaling up of Junior Farmer Field and Life Skills

activities after a successful pilot phase in two districts. This is a joint project with other UN
agencies (UNICEF, UNFPA, WFP and FAQ).

2.5 FAO’s comparative advantage

FAO Malawi has developed a close and strong working relationship with the Government of
Malawi, more specifically the Ministries of Agriculture and Food Security and Irrigation and
Water Development, to identify, implement and supervise agricultural emergency response
interventions. Close coordination has been achieved with WFP school feeding programmes;
UNICEF Life Skill training capacity and links with the MoAFS, Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Gender and other UN Agencies. In addition to this, FAQ is working with NGO partners
(Adventist Development and Relief Agency [ADRA], Catholic Development Commission
[CADECOM] and Canadian Physician for Aid and Relief [CPAR], among others) in executing a
widespread school gardens project.

In bringing about a diversified knowledge base, FAO Malawi also works closely with institutions
of learning, Bunda Agricultural College and research institutions such as the Government run
Department of Agriculture Research (Chitedze and Bvumbwe stations) and international research
institutions (CLAT, SARRNET, ICRISAT, etc.) in order to utilize their expertise, knowledge and
experiences. These close working relationships have allowed FAQ to build significant experience
and technical and practical capacity to roll out agricultural emergency activities with efficiency
and effectiveness.

3. PROJECT FRAMEWORK
3.1 Impact

The overall impact of the project will be to empower most vulnerable ﬂood affected households
to achieve improved livelihoods and long-term food and nutrition security and capacitate the
MoAFS to take a leading role in issues surrounding agricultural emergencies.

3.2 Outcome and outputs

Outcome:
0 improved food security of the ﬂood affected households in all targeted districts as a result
of timely agricultural rehabilitation interventions.

Outputs:

0 increased food production of 11 200 households which have lost their crops and other
productive assets due to ﬂoods;

0 improved access by the ﬂood affected households to quality maize seed through direct
distribution;

0 280 tonnes of fertilizer, 28 tonnes of improved maize seed and 16 800 packets of assorted
vegetable seeds procured and distributed to 5 600 affected households in Nsanje,
Chikwawa, Zomba and Mangochi districts by the end of the project;

0 improved access to planting materials of appropriate locally adapted varieties (including
cassava cuttings, sweet potato vines and legumes for crop diversification;

0 capacity of the MoAFS to coordinate and facilitate agricultural emergency interventions
improved.

For a more detailed logical framework, please refer to the annexed Log frame.

3.3 Sustainability

Considering the aims of agricultural emergency projects and their time frames, the previous
interventions have shown high levels of continuity, for example, a recent external assessment by
consultants from Bunda College has revealed that most vulnerable targeted households that have
been supported before have built capacity and resilience to fighting against natural shocks and
economics crises. Almost all small-scale irrigation schemes constructed and rehabilitated under
similar initiatives have grown into reliable income generating entities for once vulnerable and
poor households in Dowa, Ntchisi and Kasungu among many others. Participating households
have used skills learned, resource inputs supplied and supervision by the MoAFS to continue
producing for the benefit of their families.

By building capacity of the MoAFS, the project will also try to stimulate advocacy for
government budgetary allocation towards responses to agricultural emergencies thereby
encouraging the re-establishment of stronger ownership at both district and national levels. The
project will encourage the ministry focal point persons to take a leading role in responding to
agricultural emergencies other than leaving the responsibility to the DODMA and other
developing partners.

The intervention should also help to shift focus from “emergency” type of discussions of over the
past five years and facilitate a discussion on longer-term agricultural recovery and improved
farming practices. It will be a priority to ensure that both local NGOs and existing civil society
groups are part of the capacity building initiative in order to inﬂuence the debate on early
recovery.

3.4 Risks and assumptions

The following points describe some of the factors that have an important bearing on a successful
implementation of the project’s activities:

0 most areas that were affected by ﬂoods will have enough residual moisture to support
winter production OR there are perennial streams that can be diverted using gravity flow
to water crop fields;

0 key vulnerable or affected households are identified and targeted by an implementation
team, that local leadership and MoAFS field staff work closely with the implementation
teams to reduce cheating and double targeting;

0 intervention activities among UN as well as government sector ministries are well
coordinated, targeted and complement one another for optimum impact;

0 effective partnerships amongst relevant providers of complementary services (e.g. the
Government, private sector, and UN agencies);

0 MoAFS take a leading role in ensuring that activities of the project are implemented in
line with Government’s priorities.

4. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
4.1 Institutional framework and coordination

The project will request the MoAFS to appoint one staff who will be part of the implementation
team of this project. By working together with government ministries, the ECRU will ensure

l2

continued and improved technical efficiency in project implementation. Most importantly the
robust and enduring linkages formed with other UN agencies, research and education institutions,
and the MVAC (in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development) and the technical
secretariat within the MoAFS will be closely maintained as these bodies have provided continuity
and a focal point for coordination for all stakeholders during the past five years.

4.2 Strategy/methodology

The methodology of input procurement and distribution has been largely developed, implemented
and evaluated. This does not mean that it is static; evaluations have revealed much information
and challenges that need to be addressed and improved. However, this methodology and targeting
criteria are grounded within a secure foundation and demonstrably incorporate women and men
of all ages, vulnerable children, orphans and HIV and AIDS affected and infected individuals.

This project will be implemented collaboratively with the MoAFS and DODMA. The project will
target 11 200 households in traditionally ﬂood affected districts. Half (5 600) will be targeted for
irrigated agriculture while the other half will be targeted for crop diversification on the
assumption that not all affected households will have access to enough residual moisture or
perennial streams to support irrigation activities. However, if there are more households with
access to enough moisture per district than targeted, the project will be flexible to incorporate
them and then reduce on the crop diversification part. This strategy is considered based on the
available resources. The targeted districts are Nsanje, Chikwawa, Mangochi and Zomba. Other
affected districts have been left out due to logistical reasons as well as limited resources. The
breakdown of beneficiary households per district will follow the joint DODMA/UN assessment
and verification report. In keeping with the need to ensure uniformity in targeting, this project
will endeavour to closely liaise with WFP’s food distribution procedures. This will ensure that
those households that are benefiting from WFP’s food distribution programme in affected
districts and had their crops damaged also benefit from the agricultural project.

As soon as the project is approved by the MoAFS, there will be district meetings in all targeted
districts to sensitize the district officials and plan together. This will ensure that modalities of
implementation and targeting are well understood. The project will have a district focal point
preferably from the district agriculture office but reporting to the ministry headquarters through
the district assembly. The district meetings will be followed by community sensitizations,
beneficiary identification and verification. Procurement of seeds and other inputs will be done in
consultation with both district agriculture offices and the beneficiary households and it will be
ensured that varieties of crops adapted to farmers agro-ecological conditions are distributed to the
farmers. These inputs will include fertilizers, good quality seed of appropriate varieties of maize
and vegetables for winter production along river banks. The inputs will be procured from
government certified seed suppliers like Seed Co., Pannar Seed and others while fertilizers will
be procured from private traders currently operating in the country. In the interest of time, the
project will procure the inputs and directly distribute to beneficiary households other than
conduct input trade fairs. Each beneficiary household will receive 5 kg of improved maize seed,
basal and top dressing fertilizers (25 kg each) and three different types of vegetable seeds.

Parallel to input provision for winter production, beneficiary households will be trained in crop
and diet diversification as a way of expanding their food basket and spreading the risk of food
insecurity. Training will be conducted jointly by the MoAFS with FAQ. This training will be
followed by provision of inputs to facilitate crop diversification. Each beneficiary household will

13

receive 1 (one) kg of each of the following legumes or any other combination (deemed
appropriate through consultations), ground nuts, beans or pigeon peas and soya beans; siX bags of
sweet potato vines (50 kg by volume) and five bundles of cassava cuttings. After maturity, the
beneficiary households will be required to pass on part of the seed in a pass on scheme, under the
guidance of field technicians who will take into consideration seed quality, particularly sanitary
condition of planting materials so that more households, can have access. These inputs will be
utilized during the summer production starting in October 2008.

The project will also aim at building capacity of the MoAFS at all levels in order to enhance
coordination of agricultural emergencies including assessments. The project will train district
MoAFS staff on assessing, analysing and reporting agricultural emergencies. This approach will
assist in ensuring that credible data is collected and shared during emergencies thereby reducing
costs for verifications and time taken to respond to such emergencies. It is also envisaged that by
building the capacity of the MoAFS, the ministry will assume its leading role in coordinating
responses to agricultural emergencies.

4.3 Government inputs

Specifically the Government of Malawi through the MoAFS will lead the implementation of the
project through the office of the focal point for agricultural emergencies while at the same time
providing policy support and direction. Through its different structures, the Government is best
placed to effectively contribute towards efficient implementation of activities of this project. At
different levels, the project will utilize government staff for training assignments and supervisory
work. In ensuring sustainability, the Government will also provide leadership through chairing all
the meetings to be conducted during the implementation of this project. It is expected that the
Government will dedicate officers who will be given enough support to fully steer the
implementation process.

4.4 Donor inputs

The main input from the donor is financial support to commence activities of this project. It
would be desirable if the donor also appointed a focal person who could be mandated to closely
follow the implementation process.

4.5 Technical support/linkages

The project implementation team will provide a hub for technical reference and direction.
Through its membership (FAO and MoAFS), the team will facilitate knowledge generation and
sharing; and then link to appropriate institutions for advocacy and dissemination. In addition, as
has been the case in the past, normally, there will be technical backstopping and advice from
RIACSO in Johannesburg as well as from the desk officers and technical divisions in FAQ
headquarters, Rome.

4.6 Management and operational support arrangements

This project will be managed at three levels. Firstly through a desk officer of FAO’s Emergency
Operations Service, Rome which provides linkages to the technical and operation divisions of
FAO headquarters and which overlooks all aspects of project implementation.

14

Secondly, through the FAO Regional Emergency Office in Johannesburg that will oversee the
effective implementation of the project and guide on operational and technical aspects, as
appropriate. This team will be responsible for tracking and coordinating all activities.

Lastly, through the FAO ECRU and MoAFS team at country level, responsible for the day to day
running and coordination of project activities. This team will be led by an Emergency and
Rehabilitation Coordinator who is assisted by a team of experts and specialists and a focal point
from the MoAFS. Parallel to this team is a team of project monitors which is responsible for
follow-up and to ensure that activities are implemented in line with the objectives and set outputs.
Above all, there will be continued monitoring and coordination by the Government through its
district structures and field staff.

5. OVERSIGHT, MONITORING, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND
REPORTING

5.1 Oversight and reviews

Project oversight will be conducted jointly by FAO and the MoAFS. Overall project
implementation, budgetary and management oversight will be conducted by the FAO ECRU.

The MoAFS in liaison with FAQ will be mandated to organize review meetings as appropriate in
order to share experiences and lessons. These review meetings will be complemented by the end
of project review exercise preferably carried out by external personnel or MoAFS. Thereafter, the
review exercises will feed into the final evaluation to establish the impact of the project on the
target population.

5.2 Monitoring and knowledge sharing

This project has a pre-established monitoring and evaluation team, which not only monitors this
project, it also works within the MVAC and facilitates and shares information with each ministry
counterpart. Monitoring and Evaluation is systematic and FAO’s ECRU project monitors work
hand in hand with monitoring personnel from MoAFS and implementing partners. Random
project monitoring is a must in all ECRU-Malawi projects to ensure qualitative and timely project
implementation in accordance with agreed work plans and project objectives.

Reviews involving all stakeholders will be instituted in order to establish the extent to which
efficiency and efficacy is being realized in the course of implementation. However, all these
monitoring endeavours will follow the detailed log frame annexed.

5.3 Communication and visibility

Working with government counterparts, the ECRU has developed comprehensive communication
and visibility material and messages. The previous projects have featured on national television,
in the Government and private media and in radio slots. This expertise will be transferred to the
proposed project. In addition, the ECRU will continue to include appropriate donor logos on all
training posters, documentations as well as promotional material such as t- shirts and others. In
addition, the donor will need to advise on its policy regarding communication and visibility.

15

5.4 Reporting schedule

FAO and MoAFS will submit two narrative quarterly reports and a terminal report within twelve
months of the closure of the project as detailed in the signed MoU. Separately, monthly updates
will be prepared on request.
