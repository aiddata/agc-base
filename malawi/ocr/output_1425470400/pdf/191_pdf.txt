Narrative

The young democracy in Malawi is facing challenges. The very essence of politics has been reduced to
inter and intra party rivalry to the extent that politics is deemed by many as being destructive. This
political fallout has the potential of watering down whatever little gains have been registered in the
deveIOpment of democracy in the country. Moreover the General Elections are scheduled for 19 May
2009.

In an emerging democracy like Malawi, political parties, which are major players in many
democracies, are faced with number of challenges. Such challenges include weak institutional capacity
to manage party affairs, poor intra—party democracy, weak party leadership, and incessant inter-party
rivalries. This project aims at developing the capacity of political parities in Malawi to (a manage their
party activities by strengthening the political party secretariats; (b) strengthening intra-party
democracy through training and establishment of procedures: and (0) support intra-party conﬂict
resolution through training and leadership development
