ANNEX II

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS FOR
IMPLEMENTATION

THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI

Title : Support to the National EPA

(National and Trade Policy Forum)
Accounting N°: 9 ACP MAI 022
Identiﬁcation N°: MAI/007/04

Secretariat

   

 

SUMMARY

The basic philosophy underlying the ACP—EU cooperation is to deﬁne, in the
long term, a framework agreement of privileged relationships, founded on three
pillars; the political dimension, trade and development aid, with an overall
objective of reducing global poverty and achieving progressive integration of
the ACP countries into the global economy. Malawi’s trade policy lies within
the context of its national development policy whose primary goal is also to
reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable economic growth.

In view of the objectives and principles set out above, the planned Economic
Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are intended to restructure trading arrangements
between the ACP countries (Malawi) and the EU to make them more effective
in promoting bilateral trade, more supportive of broader development goals and
more compatible with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The fundamental
condition for realising the potential beneﬁts of the EPAs is to utilise the EPAs as
instruments for development.

Both the Government of Malawi (GoM) and the EC have accepted the
responsibilities spelled out in the Cotonou Agreement for the design and
implementation of the Malawi — EC Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and the 9th
EDF National Indicative Programme (NIP) for the period 2002—2007, and have
agreed to implement these principles. The objectives of the EC development co-
operation outlined in the CSP and the NIP match the development objectives of
Malawi which are included in the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(MPRSP).

It is stated in the CSP that ‘Malawi can beneﬁt from the new ACP-EU trading
arrangements, as foreseen in the Cotonou Agreement, by participating in an
EPA’. Furthermore, the Commission is committed to ‘supporting Malawi in
can'ying out trade negotiations on a regional and multilateral level and
implementing the accompanying trade policy and structural reforms’.

INTERVENTION

The project aims to support the Malawi National Development and Trade Policy
Forum (NDTPF). For effective organisation and coordination of the EPA
negotiations, the establishment and sustainability of an NDTPF plays a central
role. Each country within the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) regional
grouping has established such a forum.

Several Malawi-speciﬁc and trade-related studies show that institutional and
human resource capacity is an area which needs the most support in terms of
constraints to the country’s trade development. The ﬁrst Trade Policy Review of
Malawi (TPRM)' recognised the need for Malawi to improve its trade related
institutional framework, its business environment, and to restore
macroeconomic stability. Under the Integrated Framework’s comprehensive
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (February 2004) similar concerns have also
been underlined. The Sustainability Impact Assessment (SLA) study of EPAs on
Malawi (November 2004) concluded that Malawi stands to beneﬁt more by
negotiating an EPA with the EU. '

 

' WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM), Malawi 2002.

 

The major risk as far as the sustainability of the forum is that of human resource
limitations, a pertinent constraint in Malawi’s trade and private sectors.
Furthermore, the TPNWG handles other national and international trade issues
other than those related to the EPAs. A major assumption however, is that the
sub-committees will also coordinate WTO related issues to avoid duplication of
efforts and to enforce the importance of the EPA process.

The main assumption is that all necessary activities will have been carried out
by the end of the EPA negotiating period (December 31“, 2007) to be of
maximum use to Malawi. The focus from 2008 onward should be towards the
strengthening of the already formulated national and regional positions. Another
important assumption is that ‘the committees’ are constantly represented (i.e.
staffed) and operational.

2.1. Overall Objectives

The overall objective of the support to the National Development and Trade
Policy Forum in the context of the EPA negotiation process is coherent with the
MPRS and the MEGS. The purpose is to reduce poverty and achieve rapid
economic growth in Malawi through the development of more open, outward~
oriented and competitive in country, inter-regional and eventually North-South
market economies, using the EPA as an instrument for development and for
fostering the smooth and gradual integration of Malawi into the global economy
as speciﬁed in the Cotonou Agreement.

The project will address Malawi’s capacity to participate effectively in the
forthcoming EPA negotiations with the EU and other trade negotiations whilst
ensuring that the EPA is directly linked to the Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS), involves the Private Sector in the EPA process and facilitates
the further mainstreaming of ‘trade’ into the MGDS and Malawi’s Integrated
Framework process.

2.2. Project Purpose

The speciﬁc objective of this project is effective EPA negotiations to provide
support to the National Development and Trade Policy Forum (NDTPF),
through the MoTPSD, GoM; to enable it carry out effectively its main
objectives in the context of Malawi’s preparations for the EPA negotiations. The
NDTPF’s main role is to;

(i) determine the optimal development and trade negotiating position(s) for
Malawi; (ii) prepare briefs outlining these positions which will then be used by
Malawi’s representatives of the ESA Regional Negotiating Forum in
preparation of a regional development and trade negotiating position with the
EU; (iii) oversee the development of national positions as regards the EPA
negotiations in Malawi and, as such, to supervise any on—going or foreseen
national impact assessment studies.

 

2.3. Expected Results

Result 1 - Trade negotiating position(s) and impact assessment studies for
Malawi developed. (Research Work)

Incorporation of increased research work towards the EPA negotiation process

agreements as a whole.

Result 2 - Increased competence of national negotiators and stakeholders in
negotiating processes, trade analysis and assimilation of technical issues.
(Training)

An area which requires strengthening is that of ‘skills enhancement’ in terms of
negotiating and analysing global trade issues which have a direct impact on
Malawi. In part, this result will also address the aspect of human capacity
constraints pertinent to this sector.

Result 3 —- Stakeholders and the general public consulted, informed and
notiﬁed at all stages of the EPA negotiating process. (Advocacy and
consultation)

2.4. Activities

The speciﬁc activities to be carried out for each result are presented in the project
logframe, Annex A.

Activities towards result I -— Trade negotiating position(s) and impact
assessment studies for Malawi developed.

Trade negotiating position(s) and impact assessment studies for Malawi, will be

Activities towards result 2 —- Increased competence of national negotiators and
stakeholders in negotiating processes, trade analysis and assimilation of
technical issues. .

Various training activities will be undertaken so as to achieve increased
competence of national negotiators and stakeholders in negotiating processes,
trade analyses and assimilation of technical issues.

This will include the identiﬁcation of priority issues, areas and sectors of the
national economy in which human and institutional capacity should be built,
taking into account the ESA EPA Negotiating Guidelines and Mandate.

Furthermore, the NDTPF will engage in the designing and supervising of the
implementation of national capacity building programmes on trade policy,
negotiating techniques and similarly related areas.

These activities will take place predominantly in programme estimate 1 so as to
facilitate participation in regional and bilateral meetings taking place throughout
the years leading up to the end of the negotiations of the EPA.

This result is crucial to getting Malawi’s interests represented regionally and
therefore also at multilateral level. during the EPA negotiations with the EU.

Activities towards result 3 -— Stakeholders and the general public consulted,
informed and notiﬁed at all stages of the EPA negotiating process.

Throughout the project’s lifespan, stakeholders and non-state actors of all
calibres will be continuously consulted, informed and notiﬁed on the EPA
negotiations process. More importantly a dual-way feedback system will be
established and emphasised as the best way of formulating national policy
includes wide consultations with all relevant stakeholders.

Advocacy activities will include a series of consultative meetings, in all three
regions of Malawi, workshops for awareness and sensitisation, round table
discussions and dissemination of information leaﬂets.

Advocacy and consultation during the EPA negotiating preparation process
increases the likelihood that implementation of the outcome of the negotiations is
straightforward and that the entire process is owned by the stakeholders.

2.5. Indicators

The Objectively Veriﬁable Indicators are highlighted in the logical framework
(Annex A).

2.6. Lessons from past experience

Past studies (mentioned under the introduction of paragraph 2) show that the
major constraint With regard to the implementation of .trade related assistance is
that of the availability of ﬁnancial and human resources. It is apparent that the
ﬁnancing of the operations and the coordination of Malawi’s NDTPF_ should
alleviate this constraint whilst at the same time increasing the country’s
effectiveness in terms of ﬁill participation in the EPA negotiationsboth at
regional and multilateral levels.

2.7. Complementary actions

The project complements the recently completed EC funded Sustainability
Impact Assessment Study (SIA), 8 ACP TPS 110, which covers a broad
spectrum of issues that will affect Malawi’s choice of trade relations with the EU
through an EPA. Furthermore, as EPAs are modelled to be compatible with
WTO rules and regulations, all other national initiatives in this regard can be said
to have complementary actions with this project. (The activities and areas which
the NDTPF will address will also be related to issues pertinent to WTO
negotiations and more importantly, to the Doha Development Round).

2.8. Donor coordination

Trade-related coordination with other donors is ensured through various channels
such as the Integrated Framework local task force also used as a forum for
sharing information on Trade Related Assistance (TRA) to Malawi, and more
particularly, to the Ministry of Trade and Private Sector Development
(MoTPSD). Other trade related fora include the National Action Group (NAG - a
group which brings together high level representatives from the GoM, the private
sector and the donor community, to discuss and lobby for issues which need
immediate to long-term attention with regards to enabling Malawi’s environment
in improving private sector development, national growth and macroeconomic
stability). The Trade Policy National Working Group (TPNWG) is another
forum which brings together a similar group as the NAG does, but at a more
technical level. The recently launched Group on Private Sector Development is

another channel for dialogue amongst development partners (including national
stakeholders).

ORGANISATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES
3.1. Physical and non-physical means

The activities undertaken through the programme estimates are managed and
supervised by the MoTPSD under the responsibility and direction of the
contracting authority, the National Authorising Ofﬁcer (NAO), the Secretary to
the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance, who together with the EC, will ensure
that the monitoring of the implementation takes place in an efﬁcient manner.
Monitoring and efﬁciency will also be ensured by quarterly meetings of the
Project Steering Committee (PSC) which will include representatives from the
following stakeholders; the NAG, the MoTPSD, the Project Management Team,
the NDTPF and the EC Delegation as an observer.

Implementation of the project will be done by direct labour operations through
the implementation of Programme Estimates. A Project Management Team
(PMT) will be set up within the MoTPSD and will consist of three (3) support

labour components of the programme estimates. A vehicle (and a driver) will be
made available by the MoTPSD as required for the project implementation. The
Ministry will also provide for ofﬁce 5 ace and ' whils ' cut
