We propose that the following be agreed upon:

I. Project Design

1. Details of the Proiect

1.1 The Project concerns the periodic maintenance of selected sections
within the main road network (mainly resealing of road section of a length of
about 240 km) as well as protective measures against erosion at the piles
and abutments of the Luluzi and Kawiya bridge on the Dwangwa —- Nkhata
Bay road. The purpose of the Project is to reduce vehicle operation cost and
to utilize the Project roads and bridges efficiently. This is to contribute to a
sustainable improvement of the Malawian road transport system. The criteria
for reaching these objectives, the Project results and the required Project
activities as well as the assumptions underlying the Project purpose and the
Project results are contained in Annex 1.

The design of the Project is based on the documents available to KfW, the
Recipient and the Ministry of Works (MOW) and on the agreements made
between KfW, the Recipient and the Ministry of Works during the local
Project appraisal as put down in the Minutes of Meeting dated October 22,
1998.

The following Project activities are envisaged to be financed from the
Financial Contribution:

— Resealing of the M 1 section Dedza —- Nsipe (90 km)

— Erosion protection measures for the Luluzi and Kawiya bridge (M 5)
- Resealing of the M 5 section Dwangwa - direction north (55 km)

— Resealing of the M 1 section Lilongwe airport -— Kasungu (97 km)

— Resealing of the M 1 section Kasungu -— direction north (50 km)
