Subject: Irish Aid Financial Report

Attachments: Irish Aid FY09_10 Financial Report 101012.pdf
Importance: High

Dear Blessings,
Further to our telephone conversation a couple of minutes ago, I am forwarding to you the financial report.

The first column shows the actual expenditure to date. The second set of columns shows the budget and the

amount remaining from the budget when compared to actual expenditure to date. The third set of columns shows

commitments which exist on programme activities that have overshot the year-end for various reasons, but are

underway. A total is drawn including such commitments (adding them to actual expenditure) and this revised total is
. compared with the budget to give a final remaining uncommitted budget.

Note the following:

The budget is €250,000

Expenditure to date is €210,031.

However, commitments which exist on programme activities that have overshot the year-end are €22,533.
These include:

Purpose 2: €805
Literature is being sourced from the Zambia Farmers Union Conservation Farming Unit. This has taken longer than
planned however €805 is committed to this purpose.

.Durpose 5: €4,853

The above amount covers nurseries for tree seedlings for the FY10/11 season (€2,353). It was necessary to
commence this activity due to the timing of events. It also includes training of fruit trees which was delayed but is
scheduled for Nov 2010 (€2,500).

Purpose 6: €3,000
The supply of materials for human manure demonstrations is scheduled for Nov 10.

Purpose 8: €13,875

The stakeholder workshop is being undertaken in mid-October and will be immediately followed by a second
position paper based on the results.

After the above commitments, an amount of €17,436 remains which primarily arises because the Competition under
Purpose 3 was not implemented, and also because Water Harvesting funds were not utilised.

It is requested that:

 

1) €4,350 be used to sink wells and provide pumps for the water tanks already built at AMCs (6 locations). These
are working well but the water is not enough to use for thwe whole year. By sinking wells and pumping such water,

the utility of the tanks would be increased and thereby the ability to improve the utility of demonstration plots
being serviced by them.

2) The balance of funds remaining if the above is approved is €13,086. It is request that these funds be used for
procurement of bicycles for 130 Farmer Trainers (at approx. €100 each). The CA programme was designed to
operate on the back of the Farmer to Farmer trainer network (approx. 1,750 trainers). This network was initially
supplied with bikes from CORDAID funding (some purchased three years ago). However a number of these bikes are
now in need of replacement. The provision of replacement bikes will improve service / programme delivery.

I hope you find this useful. We have problems with our server. I will print and send you hard copies of the email and
the attachment, just in case i takes longer than usual to deliver.

Best regards,

Richard.

Appraisal Note for 2010111 NASFAM Progosal

1.0

Introduction

National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM) submitted a 2010/11
proposal to implement 2010/11 project on "Promoting Selected Conservation
Agriculture Techniques and Sustainable Crop Production Practices in Smallholder
Farming Systems". The overall objective of the project is to promote the principles
and practice of conservation agriculture under smallholder farmers’ conditions in the
context of climate change and escalating fertiliser prices in order to achieve
sustainable agricultural production, thereby achieving sustainable food and cash
crop production. The specific objectives of the project are to:

1.

.°°.\‘.°‘.U‘P

Increase understanding of conservation agriculture principles to the
smallholderfarmers.

Build capacity within NASFAM to support implementation of conservation
agriculture practices. v . _

Document and promo e ’ est bet’ practices in conservation agriculture
among smallholder farmers.

Promote nitrogen fixation/legumes

Promotion of agroforestry

Promotion of the use of compost manure

Promote water conservation in response to erratic rainfall
Participation/influence on policy and advocacy relating to implementation of
Conservation Agriculture (CA).

The following key achievements from Year 3 are noted as below:

4.

90% of the NASFAM members are( aware 30f conservation agriculture
(compared to 62% during the baseline), and more than 50% of the members
have dopted ‘ A practices with varying degrees of adoption for specific CA
practices.

52 programmes on CA aired on national radio station (MBC). In addition, 12
dedicated programmes on CA were aired on the same MBC. MBC has
coverage of above 80%.

Publicity of the project made through the quarterly newsletters ’Titukulane’,
including farming calendars/guidelines distributed to the NASFAM members.
NASFAM also managed to come up with a video documentary which shows
the extent to which various farmers were adopting CA practices, including

Jessﬂs and experiences over the past years.

 

Development of farmer profiles —depicting case studies for farmers involved
in various CA work under the project.

Training (and awareness) of NASFAM staff on CA implementation — through
As ' ' n Field Managers, Farmer trainers.

1453 demonstration plo" mounted in different Association Management
Centres (AMCs). Adoption competition made to promote adoption by

 

2.0

smallholder farmers. Currently the number of (early) adopters stands at

10,500 farmers.
7. Promotion of nitrogen fixation as well as agroforestry practices to farmers.

The project also involved establishing community woodlots in some selected
43 ' chools (also acting as demonstration plots).
Wfarmer trainers (1,400) and farmers on compost manure
9. water harvesting tanks/structures in Mzimba, Kasungu, Mchinji, Lilongwe,
Namwera and Zomba — expected to beef up CA demonstration around such

places.
10. Policy linkages through the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and

Natural Resources, National Conservation Agriculture Task Force, evaluation

workshops and field days on CA.
11. Impact assessment made for the whole NASFAM work, which includes a

section of CA.

Focus for 2010/11

The key focus for 2010/11 is as follows:

10.

11.

12.

13.

Continuous radio programmes on MBC (weekly programmes, including a monthly
dedicated CA programme). NASFAM will also explore using community radios in
Mzimba, Mchinji and Nkhotakota.

12,000 copies of the CA calendars (vernacular language) to be produced -— with
linkages to key stakeholders on CA.

Piloting a mobile TV campaign based on the video documentary and farmers
profiles on CA — linkages to be made with MOAFS (Department of Agricultural
Communications Branch).

Refresher courses for 57 AFOs, targeting training 30,000 farmers. Also targeted
to carry out 2 farmer field days per AMC. There will also be farmer exchange
visits at association level.

Piloting Ca resource centres in 5 AMCs (Two AMCs in Southern and Central
Region and one in the northern region).

1541 demonstration plots to be mounted — well standardised targeting one
demonstration plot per AFO.

CA adoption competition — to target 5,250 farmers

Herbicide revolving fund — members to be given herbicides to pay back in 2
instalments.

13,600 farmers targeted for the promotion of nitrogen fixation.

2 million trees targeted to be grown (under agroforestry component) — targeting
reaching 50,000 farmers by the end of the year.

1455 FTs to be trained on compost manure in order to reach a target of 34,000
farmers adopting use of compost in their farming systems

Targeting 30,000 farmers to benefit from the water conservation practices (up by
100%).

Policy influence through engagement in ASWAp, National Conservation
Agriculture Task Force, Field days and liaison through NASFAM’s policy Unit.

Process of Appraisal

Internal review of the first draft was done by the agriculture pillar team at the
Embassy of Ireland. Based on this, NASFAM submitted the second version of the
proposal

A second draft was still in bad shape. It was further reviewed and a meeting was
held to discuss the comments raised.

Based on the above, the third version was received, which addressed most of the
issues raised. Few issues were communicated for changes which led into the final
draft (4th version) — this is the version that is being considered for final review.

Key issues raised during the review/appraisal

improving the overall flow — there were some ambiguities and contradictions.
The Background needs to touch on the CA definitions and key cardinal principles.
Reference section needs to be inserted in order to strengthen arguments of the
proposal.

The proposal needs to reflect how it links to theWreas- more
especially the link to the sustainable land management.

The proposal needs to detail the key achievements made last year.

Linking the video documentary to the MOAFS efforts through the Agricultural
Communications Branch)

Farmer exchange visits were not included in the text - yet appeared on the
Logical Framework/Budget

CA material development to be coordinated through the National Conservation
Agriculture Task Force.

Demonstration plots targeted at 1,829 is too much -—needs to be revised. Also
elaboration to made reflected that farmers’ children are also targeted.

CA adoption competition — sustainable? Competition not fair as women will be
preferred.

Logframe/budget had at item on climate change (although not costed) — not
reflected in the main proposal

Under nitrogen fixing plants (legumes), there is need to link up with lCRlSAT’s
programme (championing the use of certified seedsO

Inconsistencies between numbering of text in main proposal and the
logframe/budget

Agroforestry not appearing in the main proposal, yet it is costed under the
budget ‘

Midterm review needs to be done this year so that it inform strategic future
investments as part of the project

Logframe — outputs and targets to be presented in a more quantifiable form,
with good link to budget.

Financial report needs to be submitted —declaring savings from last year

Well itemised budget notes needed.

8.0 Proposal Review Assessment

The revised proposal received has integrated the key comments raised by Irish Aid.
The following insights are noted, and well integrated;

10.

11.

The proposal flow has greatly improved. There has been a lot of effort put to
strengthen arguments, adding references, re-arranging sections and making sure
that the main proposal is consistent with the Iogframe and budget.
Table 1.1 (page 7) has been inserted which makes reference as to how the
project links to the ASWAp thematic areas. However, the table can be further
improved - ensuring consistency with numbering adopted in the ASWAp.
Farmer exchange visits will be done - targeting at association level.
The number of demonstration plots have reduced from 1,829 to 1,541. This
reduction is reasonable and more emphasis will be to target a demonstration
plot for each AFO. NASFAM will utilise the existing materials from other existing
demonstration plots to set up new ones e.g. vertivar grass. This means that
additional demonstration plots does not equate more expenditure to this item.
CA adoption competition has been maintained giving free chance for both men
and women to participate. Emphasis to be made to move away from this in order
to avoid dependency syndrome and move towards sustainability.
Linkages to ICRISAT and other programmes have been made on nitrogen fixing
plants/legumes.
The programme has a strong focus towards communication and outreach, as
evidenced through the following areas:

a. Radio programmes, Tikukulane magazine

b. Farmer profiles — with case studies to be produced (sample of ICRISAT

given)
c. Video documentary— to used for mobile TV at AMCs
d. Farmer field visits and demonstrations i.e. targeting primary schools
(capturing key lessons/communication)

e. Material development on CA — as linked to other stakeholders’ efforts
A section on cross cutting issues has been strengthened — can be improved if it
captured targets for this year explicitly.
Budget is well itemised, with clear notes.
Financial report for last year has been submitted (balance is €13,086 inclusive of
commitments already accrued). NASFAM requests if this balance can be used to
procurement of bicycles for 130 farmer trainers in order to ensure extension
reach. I would advise that the priority should be to invest this money to come up
with a credible midterm review of the programme. The review will assist us
where we need to adjust in order to make the programme reach its maximum
intended benefits. Irish Aid needs to participate in this review. The balance from
the MTR used to beef up implementation of key field activities of the
programme.
Midterm review has been added and will be done in the year— will inform future
programming strategy over the remaining years of project implementation.

6.0 Way Forward/Recommendation

1. I strongly recommend that that the proposal has gone away from far and is now
in an acceptable shape. There has been a significant revision from the first draft
that was received. NASFAM should be recommended for going an extra way
towards improving the proposal.

2. As part of implementation, there is need to continue monitoring the programme
in order to ensure that the programme is implemented as planned. The MTR
needs to be well planned (with inputs from Irish Aid) so that it informs future
project strategy and priorities.

farmers to boost their incomes and improve their standard of
living. This is expressed by our financial support for programmes
such as Farm Inputs Subsidy Programme, support for farmers to
assist them to diversify into crops such as ground-nuts Irish potato
and sweet potato — and of course support for Conservation

Farming.

o I am very pleased to announce today the grant of MKW 51.5
million (€250,000) to our partner National Smallholder Farmers
Association of Malawi (NASFAM) to implement the second year of
the Programme on 'Promoting Conservation Agriculture
Techniques and Sustainable Crop Production Practices in
Smallholder Farming Systems’.

0 The Government of Ireland has been supporting this project from
2008. To date, support amounting MK133.9miIIion
(€650,0000.00). Year 2 will build on the excellent work carried out
during the past 2 years that NASFAM has been implementing the
project.

0 The programme is due to run for another three years. It is fully in
line with the national priorities in the Agriculture Sector Wide
Approach (ASWAp) through Sustainable Agricultural land
Management thematic area. This is also in line with the first pillar
(sustainable land management) of the Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

o The importance of fertile land to crop production is well
recognised — and this has been identified an area worthy of
support by Irish Aid. Though we support the Government of
Malawi in working with smallholder farmers to improve
productivity though the Farm Inputs Subsidy Programme — we
recognise that this programme needs to be complemented with
other, more integrated ways of improving soil fertility.

 

 

Interest in Conservation Agriculture is gaining momentum
worldwide, especially in the face of climate change and the
increasing amount of agricultural land under cultivation by
smallholder farmers. Due to rising prices of fertilisers, not all the
farmers can afford to apply chemical fertilisers on their farmers.
The resultant reduced chemical fertiliser application has not only
led to lower soil fertility (particularly nitrogen) but also lead to

reduced farmers yields.

Supporting Conservation Agriculture is a very important way of
addressing soil degradation, climate change and at the same time
contributing to improved farm production in a sustainable

manner.

With the growing population growth in Malawi (around 3%), there
is limited land holding size per household. This calls for the need
for Options to increase crop productivity, soil conservation and soil
fertility. In view of this, the agricultural systems must
simultaneously contribute to the urgent need for poverty
reduction and at the same time prevent the degradation of
essential natural resources and ecosystem services. Refer to
benefits of CA in the context of erratic rainfall last year.

Today I have had the opportunity to visit some of your field sites
in Nathenje (Lilongwe South) and meet with farmers who are
learning and applying Conservation Agriculture techniques. I must
say it was very impressive and you are to be congratulated on
your efforts. The key issue is how best we can sustain the
achievements and scale up so that we have more farmers
adopting Conservation Agriculture among smallholder farmers.

Before I close my remarks, I want to highlight the 4 key issues:

0 How does the project affect the food security situation on
the targeted 108,000 smallholder farmers in Malawi? It is
important to demonstrate the effects that the project has
made towards improving the food security situation. i.e. to
what extent has the adoption of Conservation Agriculture
led to increased number of meals, enough household
income, assets and livelihoods.

 

0 To what extent is the project contributing towards adverse
effects of climate change. There is need to document to
what extent Conservation Agriculture is an answer to
adverse climate change effects e.g. dry spell. To what extent
is the project contributing towards planting trees, reducing
deforestation, increasing ground canopy etc.

0 To what extent is the farmers’ adoption increasing over
time? To what extent is the area under Conservation
Agriculture increasing or reducing? We need to clearly
document the number of farmers’ adopters by gender so
that we can monitor progress as we implement the project.

0 How best can we link the project towards policy and work
with other stakeholders within the field of Conservation
Agriculture? Close synergy and coordination among various
stakeholders is key.

 

We definitely need to demonstrate realisation of the above issues
as we implement this programme overtime.

o I wish you every success in implementing this project. I know it
involves a very big team effort between NASFAM extension
workers, local communities, other programmes, individual
farmers etc. Let’s hope that the outcome will lead to more
sustainable methods in agriculture that will lead to increased

. yields and a reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers, and that it
will help improve the environment and ultimately the quality of
life of all Malawians. This is complementary to other Irish Aid
investments like support towards the Governments Farm inputs
Subsidy Programme (FISP) and support ICRAF to implement
Agroforestry Food Security Project (AFSP).

0 With these few remarks, I wish you all the best in this year ahead
of us! Thank you

“No one has ever advanced a scientiﬁc reason for plowing. There is simply no need for plowing
in the first instance. And most of the operations that customarily follow the plowing are entirely
unnecessary, if the land has not been plowed. There is nothing wrong with our soil, except our
interference. It can be said with considerable truth that the use of the plow has actually
destroyed the productiveness of our soils. "1

 

1.0 Introduction

The challenge of agricultural sustainability has become more intense in recent years
with the sharp rise in the cost of food and energy, climate change, water scarcity,
degradation of ecosystem services and biodiversity, and most recently the financial
crisis. The expected increase in population and the associated demands for food, water
and other agricultural products will bring additional pressures. In recent decades, the
development community has been highlighting the need for the development of
sustainable agricultural systems. Some agricultural systems are still being promoted
with unacceptably high environmental, economic and social costs, albeit with the
promise of gains in output. Consequently, business-as-usual with regards to agricultural
development is increasingly considered inadequate to deliver sustainable production
intensification to meet future needs (Shaxson, 2006). This being the case, conventional
way of farming ought to be revisited.

Conservation Agriculture2 is being increasingly promoted as constituting a set of
principles and practices that can make a contribution to sustainable production
intensification because it addresses missing components in the intensive tillage-based
standardized ‘seed-fertilizer-pesticide’ approach to agriculture intensification. CA is a
concept for resource-saving agricultural crop production that strives to achieve
acceptable profits together with high and sustained production levels while concurrently
conserving the environment (FAO, 2008). It is gaining acceptance in many parts of the
world as an alternative to conventional agriculture3 and is based on the principles of
rebuilding the soil, optimizing crop production inputs, including labor (Dumanski, J. et
al., 2006). In deference to other approaches, conservation agriculture promotes a series
of principles to achieve conservation objectives, rather than a particular technology.
This is in recognition of the fact that global agriculture is practiced in many different
ecosystems, and technologies have to be carefully tailored to be successful.

1.1 The key components of optimum Conservation Agriculture

The concept of CA is outlined in a series of principles and practices that are promoted.
CA is an application of modern agricultural technologies to improve production while
concurrently protecting and enhancing the land resources on which production
depends. In its strictest sense, CA constitutes the following three components:

 

1 Edward Faulkner from Plowman’s Folly (1943), Quoted in Goddard et al. (2008).
2 The term Conservation Agriculture was adopted during the First World Congress on Conservation
Agriculture, Madrid 2001, organized by FAO and the European Conservation Agriculture Federation. See

Kassam et al., 2009
’ Conventional agriculture is normally based on soil tillage as the main operation which in the long term
leads in to a reduction of soil organic matter (See FAO, 2008).

3

1. Maintaining year—round organic—matter cover over the soil, including specially
introduced cover crops and intercrops and/or the mulch provided by retained
residues from the previous crop;

2. Minimizing soil disturbance by tillage and thus seeding directly into untilled soil,
eliminating tillage altogether once the soil has been brought to good condition,
and keeping soil disturbance from cultural operations to the minimum possible;

3. Diversifying crop rotations, sequences and associations, adapted to local
environmental conditions, and including appropriate nitrogen fixing legumes;

Therefore CA is not ‘business as usual’ based on maximizing yields while exploiting the
soil and agro-ecosystem resources. Rather, it is based on optimizing yields and profits,
to achieve a balance of agricultural, economic and environmental benefits. It advocates
that the combined social and economic benefits gained from combining production and
protecting the environment, including reduced input and labour costs, are greater than
those from production alone. With CA, farming communities become providers of more
healthy living environments for the wider community through reduced use of fossil fuels,
pesticides, and other pollutants, and through conservation of environmental integrity
and services. CA systems utilize soils for the production of crops with the aim of
reducing to a minimum the excessive mixing of the soil that is characteristic of tillage-
based farming, and maintaining crop residues on the soil surface to minimize damage to
the environment, and deploy diverse crop rotations and associations for enhancing soil
and crop health, for producing more biomass of higher quality, for integrated insect pest,
disease and weed control, for improved nutrient uptake, and for biological soil tillage.

At the production level, CA cannot be reduced to a simple standard technology package
because of the diversity and variability in agro-ecological and socio—economic conditions
that are associated with farming in general and with less favourable areas and
smallholders in particular“. Thus, the interactions between the possible recommended
technological components and the location—specific conditions of farming must be taken
into account adequately. Consequently, the standardised “best bet” production
technologies approach tend to be of limited relevance and value for many farmers
because CA practices tend to be knowledge intensive and farmers themselves must
become involved in fine-tuning the transformation and application of the principles into
site specific and farm-specific practices.

1.2 Benefits of Conservation Agriculture

CA represents a fundamental change to agricultural production systems. The main
benefits discussed below provide an indication why farmers should adopt CA and why it
deserves greater attention from the research and development community.

1.2.1 Conservation Agriculture as a fundamental change in the agricultural
production system

CA is a means of assuring production of plants and water recurrently and sustainably. It

does this by favouring improvements in the condition of soils as rooting environments.

 

4 See Theodor Friedrich et a1., 2009

CA is not a single technology, but a range based on one or more of the three main CA
principles described above and it functions best when all three key features are
adequately combined together in the field (Shaxson et al., 2008). It is significantly
different from conventional tillage agriculture. ideally it avoids tillage once already
damaged soil has been brought to good physical condition prior to initiating the CA
system. It maintains mulch cover of organic matter on the soil surface at all times and
this provides protection to both the surface and substrate for the organisms beneath
(Boddey et al., 2006). CA can retain and mimic the soil’s original desirable
characteristics on land being first opened for agricultural use. Throughout the
transformation to agricultural production CA can sustain the health of long-opened land
which is already in good condition, and it can regenerate that in poor condition.5 CA is a
powerful tool for promoting soil and thus agricultural sustainability.

FAO (2008) indicates that widespread adoption of CA has been demonstrated to be
capable of producing large and demonstrable savings in machinery and energy use,
and in carbon emissions, a rise in soil organic matter content and biotic activity, less
erosion, increased crop-water availability and thus resilience to drought, improved
recharge of aquifers and reduced impact of the apparently increased volatility in
weather associated with climate change. it will cut production costs, lead to more
reliable harvests and reduce risks especially for small landholders.

1.2.2 Higher stable yields and incomes from CA

As an effect of CA, the productive potential of soil rises because of improved
interactions between the factors of productivity.6 The combination of these features to
raise productive potential makes the soil a better environment for the development and
functioning of crop plants’ roots. Improvements in the soil’s porosity have two effects: a
greater proportion of the incident rainfall enters into the soil; and the better distribution
of pore-spaces of optimum sizes results in a greater proportion of the received water
being held at plant—available tensions. Either or both together mean that, after the onset
of a rainless period, the plants can continue growth towards harvest — for longer than
would previously been the case — before the plant-available soil water is exhausted. In
addition, increased quantities of soil organic matter result in improved availability, and
duration of their release into the soil water, of needed plant nutrients — both those within
the organic matter and those from off-farm. Thus the availability of both water and plant
nutrients is extended together. Under these conditions, plants have a better
environment in which to express their genetic potential. Yield differences have been
reported in the range of 20-120 per cent between CA systems and tillage systems in
Latin America, Africa and Asia (Pretty et al., 2006). in Paraguay for example, small
farmers have been able to successfully grow crops that initially were thought not to be
appropriate for no-till systems, such as cassava. Planting cassava under CA in

hydrological - water available.

 

 

combination with cover crops has resulted in substantial yield increases, sometimes
double the yields compared to conventional farming systems (Derpsch & Friedrich,
2009). In addition, the financial benefits for farmers in Latin America who have adopted
CA have been striking. However, these take time to fully materialize7.

1.2.3 Climate change adaptation and reduced vulnerability

Reduced vulnerability to effects of drought, less erosion, and lesser extremes of soil
temperatures represent a managed adaptation of CA systems to climate change effects
such as, for example, more intense rainstorms, increased daily ranges of temperatures,
and more severe periods of drought. Overall, CA systems have a higher adaptability to
climate change because of the higher effective rainfall due to higher infiltration and
therefore minimum flooding and soil erosion as well as greater soil moisture—holding
capacity. The advantage of CA over tillage agriculture in terms of the greater soil
moisture-holding capacity and therefore duration of plant-available soil moisture is
illustrated by Derpsch et al. (1991), who show that soil moisture conditions in rooting
zones through growing seasons under CA are better than under both minimum and
conventional tillage. Thus crops under CA systems can continue towards maturity for
longer than those under conventional tillage. In addition, the period in which available
nutrients can be taken up by plants is extended, increasing the efficiency of use. The
greater volume and longer duration of soil moisture’s availability to plants has significant
positive outcomes both for farming stability and profitability. Infiltration rates under well
managed CA are much higher over extended periods due to better soil porosity. In
Brazil, a six-fold difference was measured between infiltration rates under CA (120 mm
per hour) and traditional tillage (20 mm per hour)8. CA thus provides a means to
maximize effective rainfall and recharge groundwater as well as reduce risks of flooding.
Due to improved growing season moisture regime and soil storage of water and
nutrients, crops under CA require less fertilizer and pesticides to feed and protect the
crop, thus leading to a lowering of potential contamination of soil, water, food and feed.

1.3 NASFAM’s Conservation Agriculture Programme

NASFAM has always included aspects of natural resource and land use management
within its crop production programming and training. However, this had traditionally not
been a main thrust of programmatic focus. In 2008 prices of in inorganic fertilizer
increased, making such fertilizers grossly unaffordable to the majority of smallholders.
NASFAM reassessed its programming and noted the need for much expanded
interventions not just in the area of natural resources management (NRM) but
specifically in regard to the promotion of a viable alternative form of farming for its
membership; a form of farming which did not rely on unsustainable practices and
unaffordable inputs.

 

7 Sorrenson (1997) compared the financial profitability of CA on 18 medium and large-sized farms with
conventional practice in two regions of Paraguay over 10 years. By year 10, net farm income had risen on
CA farms from USD10,000 to over USD30,000, while on conventional farms net farm income fell.

8 See Landers, 2007

Thus, in mid-2008 NASFAM embarked on the active and specific promotion of
Conservation Agriculture (CA) amongst its membership because of the substantial
benefits such a programme promised and because it has become a necessity for
sustainable crop production in recent years. in the “short term, it was seen that
Conservation Agriculture techniques could help address crop productivity needs, and in
the medium to longer term, they could help to improve soil structure and fertility, and
contribute to managing our natural resources more sustainably. Within NASFAM’s Key
Results Framework, Key Result Area 2 is “to improve crop productivity and quality”.
The programme strongly supported meeting this objective. On the broader scale, the
project fits well within the Malawi Government’s prioritized and harmonized
development agenda, the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp). The table below
shows the linkages existing between the project proposed herein and the ASWAp.

Table 1. 1 Alignment of selected project objectives with the strategic objectives of the
ASWAP under Focus Area 39

It is worth noting that the programme has two facets. At a technical level, the correct
and appropriate techniques and technologies must be selected and made accessible to
farmers. But more than this, the programme is ultimately one which seeks to achieve

behaviour change, and not simply a matter of making knowledge available. Care is
needed in order to ensure farmer “buy-in”. Given the fact that CA is a relatively new
concept in Malawi, and that there are few well established examples in the country to
draw from, NASFAM considered it reasonable to build the programme up progressively
by piloting various activities in the first year and using results to inform programme
development in subsequent years. This annual process of review and programme
refinement will continue of course, and is an important aspect of achieving desired
impact.

2.1 Overall objective of the programme

The overall objective of the programme is to promote the principles and practice of
Conservation Agriculture under smallholder farmer conditions in the context of climate
change and escalating fertilizer prices in order to achieve sustainable agricultural
production, thereby achieving sustainable food and cash crop production while
reversing environmental degradation.

2.2 Specific Objectives

The specific objectives of the project which commenced in October 2008 and are still
relevant are given below. What follows immediately after each specific objective is a
summary of progress made since the inception of the programme. This is followed by a
detailed description of activities that NASFAM intends to carry out during the coming
year

2.2.1 To increase understanding of Conservation Agriculture

In order to enhance understanding of the benefits that CA offers both in the short term
and long term, NASFAM has, over the last two years promoted awareness and adoption
of CA because this remains essential to the success of the rest of the project’s specific
objectives. The awareness campaign was conducted through three main modes of
communication: radio, publications and most recently video documentary. An annual
assessment of the CA programme that was conducted in September indicates that the
project has been very successful in creating awareness on CA practices among both
members and non members. The figure below compares the level CA awareness
between members and non members. From the survey it is shown that 90% of
NASFAM members are now aware of CA practice compared to 62% during the
inception of the project. in terms of adoption, more than 50% of members have adopted
CA practices with varying adoption rates for specific CA practices.10

Radio Programme

With regard to radio programmes, NASFAM has been informing farmers of the benefits
of CA through the weekly MBC Radio 1 programme ‘u/imi ndi Biz/nezi’ (farming is
business) that is aired twice a week. Every month, there has also been a programme
specifically dedicated to CA. MBC radio one has nationwide coverage and unlike all
other radio stations that broadcast on Frequency Modulation (FM) only, it also
broadcasts on Short Wave (SW). In Malawi a considerable section of people in the
rural areas own radios that have the SW frequency only. The radio programme had
become hugely popular among members based on the feedback gathered through
Monitoring and Evaluation visits.

In the coming year, NASFAM will continue with radio programmes on MBC Radio 1. 2
radio programmes per week will be aired with 1 programme specifically dedicated to
CA. Because of its growing popularity in the country, ZODIAK Broadcasting Services
was approached to see if it could air some of the programmes. However, the rates are
too high and do not justify a switch. In addition to MBC, NASFAM will also buy airtime,
as a pilot, on selected community radios in Mzimba, Mchinji and Nkhotakota so that
they can present pre-recorded material. This is different from last year’s concept where
it was expected that the community radios ill generate the material on their own

Publications

The ratio of farmers per field officer is too high. Even with the Farmer-to—Farmer
Training Programme that NASFAM initiated in 2007, the ratio is still high that in most
some cases, the technical needs of farmers are not addressed on time“. Apart from the
radio programme, NASFAM has been producing farming calendars in Chichewa and

Trainers. This is against a membership of over 100, 000 farmers.

Tumbuka and distributing one calendar per club. Although illiteracy is high in the rural
areas, most NASFAM members are able to read and write because of the functional
adult literacy training that has increased the capacity of both male and female members
to effectively and sustainably farm as a business. To date, 30,000 members who were

hitherto illiterate are now able to read and write.

The use of calendars has proved to be one of effective strategies to making sure that
farmers have information. Bearing in mind that CA is a new concept, there is a lot of
information that is yet to reach the farmers in the field and one way of doing that is by
providing different messages to be followed in line with dates on farming calendars. This
information is brought in form of continuum lather than repeating the same messages.
NASFAM collaborates with other stakeholders like Land Resources department, Total
Land Care, National Conservation Task force and Conservation Farming Unit in Zambia
to bring in new information altogether.

The farming calendars play a vital role by guiding the farmers as well as Farmer
Trainers on the set of activities that need to be carried out in the fields. This eases
pressure on the AFOs as well as FTs as most farmers work on their fields on time. In
the coming year, NASFAM will produce and distribute 12,000 copies of calendars to all
clubs (one copy per club). The use of the local languages provides easy understanding
of the message carried out on the calendars. Further, the farming calendars provide
guidelines on monthly basis on CA activities for farmers to implement in their own fields.
Those farmers who are still unable to read and write will benefit from the literate who
read and relay the messages to them during club meetings.

Video Documentary

During the last half of this year NASFAM began producing a video documentary. At the
moment footage that was captured has been edited ready for community ‘shows’. The
video documentary will complement the efforts being made by the unit to impart skills
and knowledge on CA activities to the farmers. This has the potential of becoming very
popular because the farmers can ‘see’ the process involved. The video will show other
farmers who are practising CA and they will be explaining what they do and know about
CA. The video will also contain CA training slots by AFO and/or FSO to add more
knowledge. The focus areas are on how to use manure, soil cover using crop residues,
pit planting in maize and other crops, and use of Msangu, Faidherbia abide, as a
fertiliser tree.

NASFAM has observed that it is becoming difficult to get as many farmers as possible
to have an open-day training session at one point. NASFAM believes that an innovative
way of reversing this is through the use of television as one way of capturing the
attention of farmers. it is against this background that NASFAM wants to pilot a mobile
TV campaign in selected Association Management Centres (AMCs). The TVs will be
kept at the Association Management Centres but the Association Business Manager will
be liaising with AFOs on arrangements of dates to show in GACs. The Regional
Manager will be the responsible person to look at the way the dates are rationed in
associations and management or security of these TVs while Farm Services unit of

10

NASFAM will be responsible for generation and scheduling of information. Some
information will be sourced from other stake holders such as Department of Land
Resources, Department of Agricultural Research and Technological Services (DARS),
lCRAF, CFU and Total Land care.

NASFAM technical staff will be present during these ‘shows’ to respond to questions
from farmers. To ensure maximum patronage possible, the dates of these ‘shows’ will
be announced in advance on the radio programme. NASFAM will liaise with the
department of Agricultural Communications Branch so that it takes advantage of the
department’s mobile van (popularly known as the yellow van). This process will be
simplified because the department has yellow vans in all Agricultural Development
Divisions (ADDs). These yellow vans will be beaming the videos in Group Action
Centres or Market Action Centres (made up of at least 9 clubs). NASFAM will take
advantage of its radio programme to announce dates and time for these shows so that
people are made aware in advance.

It is important to mention that although the primary aim of all these three strategies
above is to increase awareness of the principles of CA, this year deliberate efforts will
be made to present farmer profiles and case studies of the benefits of CA. In the case
of the radio programme, farmers whose yield has significantly improved as a result of
adopting CA will be making presentations to fellow farmers on the benefits that they
have accrued to them. Similarly, with publications (in T/tukulane Newsletter, compelling
hard evidence will be profiled for farmers that are practising CA so that members can be
convinced that Conservation agriculture offers a powerful option for meeting future food
demands while also contributing to sustainable agriculture and rural development.

2.2.2 To build capacities within NASFAM to support implementation of
Conservation Agriculture practices

NASFAM extension system comprises of 57 Association Field Ofﬁcers (AFOs) and
1455 FTs at club level serving around 100,000 farmers in 14 AMCs. in the last two
years, a series of training workshops and meetings have been held. Over the last two
years, the focus was building the capacity of NASFAM staff on CA. Now that we are
entering a third year of implementation, emphasis will be placed on training the FTs
adequately to make sure that they impart the knowledge to fellow farmers.

Training

NASFAM is committed to continue training the extension staff and FTs. Taking staff
through demonstrated training complemented by practical demonstrations in selected
mother demos mounted in each AMC will provide a benchmark to identify the gaps and
areas of emphasis during the subsequent trainings. The experience that five NASFAM
staff has drawn from CFU through exchange visit during the field day in Chipata sets a
good example. Building on this experience, regional exchange visits will be promoted
among the AFOs and FTs to increase information and experience sharing.

11

During the coming year, NASFAM intends to conduct Training of Trainers for AFOs and
FTs. Refresher courses for 57 AFOs will be conducted. These will last for 2 days. In the
second quarter, training for 1455 FTs will also be conducted and a review meeting for
this training shall be conducted in July. By the end of the year, it is envisaged that the
AFOs and FTs will have trained 30,000 farmers. In addition, NASFAM will conduct
farmer field days in all the AMCs. Every AMC will conduct at least 2 farmer field days.
The common questions from the farmers to emerge from these trainings and farmer
field days will be featured during the CA dedicated radio programme. Here, Farm
Services Officers will be explaining in detail and providing clarity on areas still sticky
with the farmers. This will provide farmers with a chance to address some of the
challenges they face which may be specific to an area.

Conduct Community Awareness

While significant strides have been made in creating CA awareness among the
membership and staff, NASFAM feels that the capacity building has to target the entire
community through mass awareness meetings. This is building on the lessons learnt
from implementing the project over the last two years that while selected farmers within
the community would wish to implement soil cover and conserve crop residues for use,
other members of the community burn the crop residues, feed the crop residues to
livestock or use for firewood or burning tobacco nurseries. This comprises the adoption
of the soil cover as one of the key principles of CA. This will be complemented by the
video documentary to apps on the message to all the members of the community. lt is
expected that at the end of the outreach programme, members of the community will
appreciate and support the farmers who keep residues in the field as soil cover.

Farmer Exchange Visits

The introduction of new technologies gets different responses from smallholder farmers
due to several reasons. In order to facilitate adoption of CA farmers or members need to
build confidence that they can implement a technology by seeing what others have
done. NASFAM has therefore decided to conduct exchange visits for farmers and
frontline staff. Farmers will be taken to sites where they will appreciate what CA is able
to do and the progress that some farmers have so far made in as far as CA is
concerned. Those farmers that have not yet adopted will be motivated to do so while
those that have already adopted will be encouraged even more. The exchange visits will
be conducted at Association level. Front line staff will also go on exchange visits t learn
from other experts from other institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and food
security as well as Total land Care.

Establish CA Resource Centres at the Association Offices

The absence of CA reference material has been one of the bottlenecks encountered
during implementation. This is not only to NASFAM but a country as a whole. This may
be attributed to the direction the country undertook to promote ‘modern’ methods of
farming that focused on annual ridging, heavy use of inorganic fertilisers, use of hybrids
seeds, without the mention of CA. This was also aggravated by the exclusion of CA in
the curriculum of all Agricultural training institutions in Malawi which led to graduates
with limited knowledge on CA. NASFAM looks at this as impediment to the smooth

12

transfer of correct information to the farmers by the extension staff and creation of
resource centres where reference books can be kept at each AMC is very essential and
will provide timely reference and feedback to issues which farmers may raise on CA at
the local level. This will be done as a pilot in selected 5 AMCs”. Depending on how
successful and useful it turns out to be, it will be expanded during the next year. These
resource centres can be beneficial to other organisations which want to deepen the
understanding of the CA in Malawi. NASFAM intends to engage professional services of
a consultant from CFU in Zambia to produce the material. This will later be reproduced
and distributed to all AMCs.

2.2.3 To document and promote ‘best bet’ practices in Conservation Agriculture
among smallholder farmers

Demonstration Plots and Field Days

Learning about CA alone is not enough; it is important for the farmers to be able to put
into practice what they have learnt. It is also clear that sometimes farmers wait to see
some results first before they can adopt a new practice. Over the last two years,
demonstrations have been set up to provide visual and practical learning for the
farmers. in some cases, farmers were supported to directly try out the practice in their
fields. The major learning point that the demos have provided to the farmers has been
the outstanding performance of the maize crops during the drought period of the season
contrary to the maize planted on ridges. It is easy for farmers to observe that the soil
cover promotes rainwater infiltration, reduces water loss from the soil and inhibited the
growth of weeds.

An annual review of the programme that was conducted exposed the need to
standardize demonstration plots so that concrete information is generated and
transferred to the farmers. NASFAM will this year set 13 standard demonstration plots
which will be strategically located in the AMCs in terms of visibility and accessibility. It is
intended that were possible the plots should be close to the tarmac road. The
standardization will among other involve reducing the variability of the crop growth
factors. Crops that will be grown are maize, ground nuts, pigeon peas, beans and
fertiliser trees. The technologies demonstrated will be normal planting (as a control), pit
planting, maximum soil cover and intercropping. Data that will be collected from these
plots include planting dates; date and type of any operation carried out; number of field
days and attendance disaggregated according to gender; yields; pests and diseases
infestations if any. On all these standard demonstration plots, sign posts will be elected
and treatments will be labelled to provide hanged around demo sites for publicity while
treatments will be well labelled to enhance clarity on what is being demonstrated.

NASFAM intends to continue mounting demonstration plots during the coming year.
This year 1541 demonstration plots will be mounted. This will be achieved by allocating
at least one demonstration plot per AFO, one per Farmer Trainer, one per ABM and 5

 

13 Two AMCs in the Southem and Central Regions and one in the North.

13

 

each for the three Farm Services Officers (FSO)13. Some of the demonstration plots will
be set up using seed gathered from previous seasons, for example, there are already
established vertiver nurseries that will be transferred and transplanted to other fields for
demonstration, pit planting and even maximum ground cover. Some of these
demonstration plots will be captured on video camera and form part of the documentary
so that it becomes easy for the members to understand how to correctly apply the CA
principles in their own fields. In addition, in order to promote CA among the future
generation of farmers, 4 demonstration plots will be mounted on selected primary
schools in a few AMCs. All these demonstration plots will be standardized because we
would like to collect data and compare results on variable inputs.

CA Adoption Competition

That adoption by farmers remains is crucial to the success of the project is beyond
dispute. it was to be expected, however, that CA being new in Malawi would have a
somewhat slow adoption rate. in this regard, NASFAM began the CA Adoption
Competition to reward those early adopters with different agricultural prizes such as
watering cans, pangas, sickles, plastic sheets and herbicides. This is a temporary
strategy that aims at energising farmers to adopt CA”. At the moment the database
shows 10,500 farmers as early adopters. This approach has added value to making the
farmers adopt CA. Next year, NASFAM intends to run the competition for the last time.
The best adopters will be featured under the farmer profiles, highlighting the benefits
derived from the implementation of the CA practices. It is expected that 5250 farmers
will be rewarded with different prizes.

14

Figure 2 above shows how adoption of selected CA practices by NASFAM members
disaggregated by gender. As discussed earlier, the objective of the programme is to
reach out to all NASFAM members. New strategies have been developed this year
which will ensure maximum impact possible. The mounting of 981 demonstration plots
by AFOs and FTs will help to reach out to a lot of members. The mobile TV campaign
will ensure that benefits of CA are articulated to communities. All this will ensure that the
108,000 farmers (which is the ultimate target of the project) is within reasonable sight.

Herbicides Starter Pack Programme

NASFAM has noted that the adoption of pit planting and soil cover is being hampered
by limited availability of herbicides to the farmers. During the first year of adoption, the
fields are infested with plenty of weeds and use of the herbicides is strongly
recommended. However, where the herbicides are available, farmers complain of being
mixed with water resulting to more money by the retailers and less effect in the farmers
fields which has led to farmers to not completely adopt the CA practices.

Poverty levels in the country are still high with over half of the population living below
the poverty line. CA may be viewed with scepticism among some sections of the
members and hence they may not want to spend their hard-earned income on some
prerequisite inputs of CA. In order to accelerate adoption of usage of herbicides,
NASFAM will this year develop a herbicide revolving fund. Members will be given
herbicides which they will pay back in two instalments. In the first year they will pay
50% and finish the remaining 50% the following year. The money recovered will then
be used to help other members in the following year. Members that will be eligible to
qualify will have to belong to CA community groups. The AFO will be responsible for
registering the members and tracking payment throughout the year. A database of
these beneficiaries will be kept at the AMC and will be also be used by the regional
team (FSU) during monitoring visits.

2.2.4 Promote Nitrogen Fixation

NASFAM is aware that growing of legumes improves soil health with time, and it has a
nutritional value and source of income to the farmers. While success has been achieved
in promoting the legume—cereal intercropping among the farmers, its impact to
improving soil health requires time and this programme with continue because of this
long-term impact. Drawing from the lessons learnt, selection of the legume to promote
has to go with the ecological area for it was observed that the beans that was promoted
across all NASFAM operational areas did not do well in some areas. Instead, NASFAM
will promote different legumes such as groundnuts, common beans, soya beans and
pigeon peas based on agronomic performance of the crop in the given area. The
programme will be managed as a revolving basket where the beneficiaries will have
give back the seed after harvest so that other members can benefit from the same.

Under the collaboration and partnership with ICRISAT, NASFAM is reaching out to
more than 2, 000 farmers in legume seed production through Malawi Seed Industry

15

 

Development. Under NASFAM FIDP15 over 5, 000 farmers had been reached out.
Another set of 1500 farmers has been targeted under the AGRA project.16 Under CA,
legume seed will be distributed to farmers for legume-cereal intercrop. This will include
seed for crops such as beans, soya, groundnut, pigeon peas and cowpeas. Besides
increasing soil fertility by fixing nitrogen to the soils legumes are being integrated to
increase food security because of the nutritional benefits that they provide. At the end of
the year, 13600 farmers will have started practising legume-cereal intercrop.

2.2.5 Promotion of Agroforestry

Agroforestry plays a significant role in CA by mitigating the impacts of extreme weather
and soil fertility, increasing nitrogen contribution to the system, building soil organic
matter and providing ground permanent or semi-permanent dry-season cover. NASFAM
will implement agroforestry activities as part of conservation agriculture farming system.

Trees (especially the fertilizer trees) complement the soil health component of
conservation agriculture as well as for other agricultural activities like tobacco curing.
Some fertilizer trees are annual while others are perennial. AFOs will intensify training in
tree planting and management so that farmers are fully aware of the types of trees that
retain water and those that do not so that these can be avoided.

This year 2 million trees will be grown. NASFAM intends to supply seed and polythene
tubes to the communities to raise tree nurseries for schools, clinics and community
based organisations (CBOs). Each AMC will identify a big area where they will be
planting trees yearly on the same stretch. The committees that will raise nurseries and
plant trees will be trained in the planting as well as management of the woodlots. Sign
posts will be erected for all community woodlots for easy identification. This will increase
afforestation. In addition, grafting of fruit trees will be continued. In collaboration with
ICRAF, NASFAM will conduct training on fruit tree propagation in order to have fruit
trees that will bear fruits early and of high quality. This training will be provided to AFos
and FTs. At the end of the year, at least 50,000 farmers will be reached out under
agroforestry activities.

2.2.6 Promotion of the use of Compost manure

Among the CA principles being advocated for adoption, manure usage seems to be the
most popular due to the unaffordable cost of the fertilizer by most smallholder farmers.
One of the reasons for its popularity is because the targeted farmer inputs subsidy
programme (FlSP) of the Government does not provide sufficient quantities of fertilizer
and this leaves most farmers with no choice but to go for compost manure. Secondly,
compost manure is easy to make with locally available raw materials. its promotion was
enhanced by use of the CA radio programmes, articles in Titukulane newsletter, farmer
profiles and formal trainings by AFOs and FTs.

 

15 Farm Income Diversification Programme -— a programme with support from the European Union through
the Malawi Government.

1" NASFAM with support from Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) is implementing a three-
year project on increasing benefits of smallholder farmers from improved soil fertility through integration of
pigeon peas, groundnuts and conservation agriculture in maize production systems. The project is being
implemented in Kasungu, Lilongwe and Salima districts.

16

This year, there will be two main activities that will be carried out in relation to compost
manure promotion. Firstly, 1455 FTs will be trained on the best way to make compost
manure. Last year, publications on how to make manure were developed and
distributed. These will also supplement the training and the farmers will be able to refer
to them at their own. These FTs will in turn train at least 34,000 farmers. Secondly,
NASFAM will introduce manure from human waste as an alternative to compost
manure. Farmers will be taught the benefits of making use of human waste as manure.

2.2.7 Promote water conservation in response to erratic rainfall

Water conservation is a critical part of CA. Although Malawi is blessed with a lot of
water resources, the water has not been adequately and properly harnessed to obtain
optimal benefit from it. In order to demonstrate water harvesting for winter crop
production, NASFAM constructed six roof-top water harvesting tanks Mzimba, Kasungu,
Mchinji, Lilongwe South, Namwera and Zomba. Rain water has been harvested in the
tanks and during the coming year, a demonstration will be made on how best to utilize
the constructed structures. A well will be dug next to each tank to ensure water is used
throughout the season. A water pump will be installed to aid in pumping the water.

At the farmer level water will be harvested in the form of river diversion, river
impounding and canalization to benefit the farmers in their communities. About 15,000
farmers have been implementing soil and water conservation activities. This year the
targeted number of farers will scaled up to 30000 farmers. The soil and water
conservation practices that will be rigorously promoted include farming along the
contours, making tied and box ridges, seepage (infiltration) pits, vetiver grass strips and
vetiver grass nurseries for future harvesting and other practices. Three Farmer Trainers
will share a line level for the construction of marker ridge. This is a step towards climate
change adaptation where farmers will be able to increase food production by growing
crops more than once a year. It will also help force water to inﬁltrate into the soils. This
is forms part of proper watershed management especially where the intervention is
implemented in watershed areas.

2.2.8 Participation in policy and advocacy to support implementation of CA in
Malawi

NASFAM will continue to actively engage Government so that bottlenecks that
adversely affect the adoption of CA in the country should be addressed. Working
through the National Task Force on CA, and other relevant channels, NASFAM will
advocate for Government policies and programmes that support CA and that make it
easier for smallholder farmers to start implementing CA in their gardens. NASFAM
being a member of the Technical Working Group on ASWAp will advance promotion of
CA/climate change adaptation. At AMC level, AFOs/ABMs are actively involved in
district level structures especially regarding implementation of ASWAp- the activities
envisaged in this proposal and what constitute CA need to be harmonised so that we all
are talking of one and the same thing- hence influence the CA messages in the
ASWAp.

17

NASFAM will also use ‘Field Days’ to advance policy recommendations. Two field days
shall be purposely designed, targeting farmers, other CA practitioners and implementers
as well as relevant Government departments, where lessons learnt, challenges faced
and areas needing Government or other stakeholders’ intervention will be presented
and discussed. NASFAM will use the information and recommendations coming from
these field days in its policy interactions on CA.

NASFAM’s Farm Services Unit will continue to work closely with the Policy Unit to
ensure that policy recommendations related to CA reach more policy making fora. The
NASFAM policy Unit actively participates in dialogue, discussions and advocacy on
issues ranging from climate change, food security, bio fuels, environment and
agriculture commercialisation. Evidence from the Farm Services Unit on CA will be used
to make policy recommendations sounder. NASFAM will also partner with relevant
institutions such as ICRAF, FAO and CFU of Zambia to ensure the up scaling of CA in
the country.

3.0 Integration of Cross Cutting Issues: HIV/AIDS and Gender Balance

Malawi has a gender equality index (GEl) of 0.374", which is an indication that huge
inequalities exist between men and women. Women, who constitute about 51% of the
13.1 million people, are marginalized in social and economic spheres, including in
agriculture. Gender, HIV and AIDS have many complex inter-linkages with agriculture.
in the smallholder sub-sector, women provide the majority (70%) of agricultural labour.
Hence, when women are affected by HlV, the labour available for agriculture is in turn
affected. Literacy levels of women are considerably lower than those of men, making
women hard-to-reach with agriculture extension and technology, HIV and AIDS
information as well as gender information. Gender inequality and HIV and AIDS issues
have complex relationships with agriculture and rural livelihoods

3.1 Intergration of HIV/AIDS

NASFAM believes that CA practices will help those that are infected and affected by
HlV/AlDS. The adoption of Minimum tillage, pit planting, soil cover and use of herbicides
will mean less time committed on farming activities. As a result farmers can use the
freed time to care for those affected. NASFAM is aware that among its members, there
are those infected and affected who can benefit from this intervention. it is therefore
planned that farmers will benefit from this intervention with technical and material
support such as herbicides, legume seeds and organic manure for nutritional
improvements after production. NASFAM will provide the starter pack for two years

hoping that the farmers will eventually adopt in the third year after they have had the
chance to observe the benefits.

 

‘7 According to the 2010 Ministry of Agriculture’s sector strategy on Gender, HIV and AIDS.

3.2 Integration of Gender Balance
' ' historic patriarchal

Gender inequalities still exist and are d
values that have continuously put women at a disadvantageNASFAM recognises that

majority of the active farmers are women and their increased involvement in other
household activities puts pressure on them to farm let alone adopt most of the CA
activities effectively. Besides, some of the CA activities such as pit planting have proved
to be labour demanding especially for women yet women make a significant contribution
to agriculture and are the mainstay of the farm labour. In addition to their active
engagement in agriculture, women are responsible for all household chores. ln order to
enhance women participation in the CA activities deliberate efforts will be made to
encourage the participation of women in CA activities. Female FTs will encourage
fellow women to adopt CA to women because of its benefits in terms of less labour
requirements. NASFAM will produce 5 farmer proﬁles about female members who are

pioneering CA adoption in their areas.

4.0 Monitoring and Evaluation

NASFAM sees monitoring and evaluation as a prerequisite for effective project
implementation. During the pilot year of this project in 2008, a baseline study was
conducted to understand the levels of CA knowledge and adoption at the farmer level
and this is acting as a benchmark for assessing project progress. After one year of
implementation, an annual evaluation study was also conducted to assess the progress
made towards the achievement of the projects objectives and similar information was
also captured during the NASFAM impact assessment”. Information collected during
these studies has been very crucial in shaping this proposal to make sure it addresses
the most important issues for impact and success of the project. The evaluation studies
provide NASFAM with an opportunity to identify areas for improvement or change in the
project so as to continually ensure that a project remains relevant to the needs of its
members. A similar kind of evaluation has been proposed after the implementation of

the proposed interventions in 2011.

4.1 Project monitoring

There is need to continually observe the project’s progress by systematically gathering
key performance data for regular analysis. This kind of regular monitoring will focus on
activities, outputs and their contribution towards outcomes. A logframe outlining the key
actrvrties, outputs, and indicators to be measured has been developed and attached
(Table 1). The logframe is providing the basis for performance measurement and
gurdes regular monitoring. An M&E plan (outlining key indicators, data collection
methodologies, data sources and responsibilities) will be developed based on this
logframe to ensure timely collection, analysis and use of the data. A well staffed M&E
department exrsts within NASFAM who will be key in carrying out monitoring activities.

at head Office, will make periodic monitoring visits to the Associations. The visits will
help to verify reports presented by the AFOs and Farmer Trainers. They will also assist
the department to strategise implementation of the different activities based on their

findings

4.1.2 AFO/Farmer Trainer Reports and Quarterly Meetings

The AFOs and farmer Trainers will be expected to produce periodic reports covering the
status of project implementation in their areas. These reports will be discussed at their
quarterly meetings which will also serve as training sessions. The reports will then be
consolidated at this level and be presented to Head Office.

4.1.3 Mid-Term Review

A mid—term review of the programme is scheduled at the end of the year. It is expected
that among others the review will determine whether project mechanism/processes for
accomplishing the project’s objectives are efficient and effective and whether they will
lead to the attainment of the stated objectives. It is worth pointing out that the mid-term
review has no budgeted funds in the current budget but instead savings from the current
year amounting to €13,086 will be used for this purpose.

4.1.4 Irish Aid Reporting

This proposal is submitted to Irish Aid for funding. All reports for the project will be
prepared in formats and periods as specified by Irish Aid. However, because of inter
linkages between projects that NASFAM is currently implementing, NASFAM will also
be submitting its annual report that covers all programmes.

providers. The field based extension officers, AFOs, are supported by Regional Office
based Farm Services Officers. These offer training of trainers to the AFOs and in some
cases the Farmer Trainers. They are also responsible for general monitoring and
provision of oversight support to the Associations. Overall, the project is managed by
the Farm Services Manager, who is based at Head Office

6.0 Risks

6.1 Perception of Farmers

Farmers' decisions to adopt a new agricultural technology depend on many factors; one
of them their own perception. Adoption of CA and its related practices will depend to an
extent on the willingness on the part of famers to listen and learn conservation
agriculture. Their perception of intangible impacts of CA to the environment besides the
visible benefits that accrue to them individually will play a part in encouraging
participation. Change in attitude sometimes takes long but NASFAM will continue
consistently providing awareness to its membership and other farmers on the benefits of
conservation agriculture. Emphasis will also be put on demonstration plots that help
farmers to see the benefits of the new interventions.

6.2 Conflict with livestock

This is a major problem where crop residues especially maize stalks are left in the land
for organic matter build up and as a mulch for the ensuing crop. Traditionally, livestock
are put under controlled grazing during the crop season, but are left to freely roam and
graze during the off season. This can be initially permitted, but at least half of the
residues must be left. This therefore means that this risk will be dealt with by allowing a
gradual move away from total grazing of crop residues.

6.3 Poor management of the trees that will be planted

Malawi has a tree planting season which runs from December through April, where
focus is put on planting trees. The challenge however has been that once the trees
have been planted, they are not properly taken care of and they die. This cycle
continues year after year. To mitigate this, NASFAM will emphasise the planting of
trees that give benefits to farmers in the short term such as fruit trees. In most areas,
fruit trees are properly taken care of, even by children. Such fruit trees to be promoted
will include mangoes and oranges.

Previous studies done by NASFAM have also shown that farmers cut down trees to use
as fuel or for making poles. NASFAM will actively promote the use of energy saving
technologies such as chitetezo mbaula that use 1/3 of normal firewood requirements.

6.4 Fires

The biggest danger is when people are hunting mice as an additional source of food
protein. NASFAM will mitigate against this by awareness campaigns on the subject
through its radio programmes and publications. As more and more farmers and
communities are aware of the dangers of this, we expect such practises as starting up
harmful fires to subside.
