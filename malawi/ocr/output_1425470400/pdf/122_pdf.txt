Dear Mr. Diop

RE: MVAC Response Programme - Targeted Food Distribution Intervention in
Chikhwawa and Nsanje districts.

I wish to inform you that approval has been given for a grant of € 440,000 between
January and May 2011 from Irish Aid (hereinafter, also referred to as the
‘Department’) towards the above programmes.

This contribution is being made subject to the following terms, hereinafter referred to
as the “Agreement”: -

The programme activities will encompass the MVAC Response Programme -
Targeted Food Distribution Intervention in Chikhwawa and Nsanje districts as
outlined in the proposal document attached to this agreement.

1) The World Food Programme (W FP) Will monitor the project activities and will:

0 Work closely with government to oversee the programme in a proper manner
and ensure that all personnel engaged on the programme have the appropriate
skills and professional competence.

0 make every endeavour to ensure that all applicable laws, statutes and
regulations are complied with, in the course of implementing the programme.

a notiﬁcation of any changes to the programme or to the manner in which the
contribution is to be applied, must be agreed in writing in advance with the
Department of Foreign Affairs (“hereinafter referred to as “the department”).

2) Should an audit report of the External Auditors of WFP contain observations
relevant to the contribution, a copy of such report and of WFP published
comments shall be made available to the donor.

3)

4)

5)

6)

7)

8)

WFP will procure and dispose of supplies, equipment and services using WFP
Rules and Regulations.

Neither Ireland (“the State”), the Minister or the Department shall have or be
deemed to have any liability in relation to any contracts or agreements negotiated
or entered into by WFP or any other party in connection with the project. Neither
the State. the Minister nor the Department is or shall be deemed for any purpose to
be a partner of WF P.

No contractual or other relationship shall exist or be deemed to exist between the
State, the Minister of the Department and any other person employed, or sent
abroad in connection with, or otherwise associated with, or working on the
programme. None of the personnel working or who shall work on the project are,
nor shall be deemed to be, employees or agents of the State, the Minister or the
Department.

(1) Although the Minster is providing a ﬁnancial contribution towards the cost of
the programme, neither the State, the Minister or the Department shall bear any
liability for claim of whatever nature or for any court order made against WFP or
any party, arising from, or in connection with the programme and WFP will be
responsible for any liabilities, claims, actions or proceedings whatsoever in
connection with the programme.

(2) In particular and without prejudice to sub-paragraph (1), neither the State, the
Minister or the Department shall be liable in respect of any claim by or on behalf
of any advisor, manager, volunteer, expert, employee, servant or agent of WFP or
by or on behalf of any other person who may have a claim against WFP arising
out of the implementation of the programme and nor shall the State, the Minister
or the Department be liable in respect of any claims that may arise where any
advisor, manager, volunteer, expert, employee, servant or agent of WF P or any
other person, is injured, disabled or killed in the course of employment or
engagement under the programme.

It shall be the sole responsibility of WFP to take adequate and appropriate
insurance cover in relation to the programme.

The Government of Ireland may conduct an evaluation on the activities ﬁnanced
out of its contribution, based on the reports received from WFP and ﬁnancial
information contained therein. Funds made available by the Department will be
subject to internal and external auditing procedures exclusively in accordance with
the ﬁnancial regulations, rules and directives of WF P and any breach thereof shall
be notiﬁed to the Department.

This agreement will be deemed to be frustrated if:

a) Unless otherwise agreed with the Department, the programme for any reason
is not commenced within three months of the signature by WF P of this
agreement; or

The Minister in consultation with WFP considers that the events occur which
are sufﬁcient to defeat or substantially prevent or delay the achievement of the
stated objectives of the programme.

b)

WFP will be given advance notice by the Department in the event that the
Agreement is deemed to be frustrated and will be given an opportunity to
respond to the Department’s concerns before the Agreement is formally
terminated.

9) WFP agrees to refund to the Department, within six months of the completion of
the project (as per this agreement), any part of the contribution which has not been
allocated.

a) WFP agrees to refund to the Department any monies advanced by the
Department which have not been accounted for in the project to the
satisfaction of the Department.

b) Altematively, it may be agreed, by consultation with the Department, to use
the residual funds in support of activities which reﬂect the overall objectives
of the original allocation.

10) WFP will acknowledge receipt of the contribution provided by Irish Aid to the
Department within 20 days of receipt of such and also in publicity about the
programme in a manner to be agreed with the Department and in accordance with
the applicable WFP rules and regulations.

1 1) The Department reserves the right to reduce its contribution, stop transfers
prematurely or claim repayment of all or part of the funds transferred, amongst
others, if contractual obligations are not met or if it emerges that the funds are not
being used or have not been used for the purposes for which they have been made
available. The Department will initiate such reduction or termination only after
consultation with WFP after which the accounts will be settled on the basis of
costs made and taking into account, within reasonable limits, ﬁnancial obligations
already entered into, in good faith, by WFP in the implementation of the project.

12) WFP and the Department shall seek to settle amicably any differences and
disputes arising from or relating to the implementation of the programme.

13) This Agreement may not be amended, varied or modiﬁed in any way except by an
instrument in writing signed by both parties.
