SUMMARY

Road transport is by far the most important mode for the movement of people and
goods in Malawi. Over the past thirty years, the road network has developed to meet
traffic demands and the main bitumen road network covers most ofthe major internal
and regional routes. The main transport routes are the Ml/MS linking Malawi with
Tanzania and the port of Dar es Salaam; the MllMé which links Malawi with
Zimbabwe via Mozambique; the M12 with Zambia; and, to a lesser extent, the M2
through Mulanje to Mozambique.

Although the extent and coverage of the network is impressive, lack of maintenance
and inability to deal with damage due to ﬂooding has left large parts ofthe network in
a poor condition. The present project will go a long way towards improving and
restoring access on important routes which cater for heavy goods and tourist trafﬁc.
This will include repairs and rescaling of the Mangochi to Monkey Bay road, the
replacement of bridges which have been damaged beyond repair, and technical
assistance to the National Roads Authority to increase capacity to implement
maintenance programmes.

The total project cost is estimated to be €17,000,000.

The Government has undertaken to ensure that sufficient funds are made available for
future maintenance through the road fund managed by the National Roads Authority.

INTERVENTION

Overall objectives

The Malawi Government’s overall objective of poverty alleviation by improving
growth performance in economic sectors is supported by the development of an
appropriate and sustainable road transport system which is affordable to its users. The
project road and bridges are located on important routes of the road network and
therefore contribute signiﬁcantly to meeting the overall objectives. Enhancing the
institutional capacity will improve sustainability ofthe road network.

Project purpose

The project purpose is to provide sustainable improved access to the southern
lakeshore area and along the MS route, thereby ensuring sustainable access to the
northern lakeshore areas and re—establishing the important regional Northern Transport
Corridor. The technical assistance will improve the quality and capacity ofthe staffof
the NRA to manage and maintain the road network.

Results

This project will permit the rehabilitation of the Mangochi to Monkey Bay road and
the replacement of four old, damaged bridges on the Lisasadzi, Kasangadzi, Liwaladzi
and Kalwe rivers; and the construction of a new bridge and approach roads to replace
the destroyed Dwambazi bridge. In addition, engineers in the National Roads
Authority will be trained in procurement and contract administration, while also
increasing their engineering skills.

* Supervision of construction by firms of local or regional consultants, selected
following consultation with at least three firms;

* Compensation for land acquisition and borrow areas for construction;

* Construction of new box culverts, bridges and approach roads.

Technical Assistance
* Restricted tender amongst (short listed) international consulting engineers;
* Engineering assistance in procurement and contract administration,

Project analysis

Lessons from past experience

Past experience of road management and maintenance, through Government force
account methods, showed that road maintenance received low priority and that most
roads did not achieve their design lives. The inability to keep up with road
maintenance needs led to rapid deterioration and high vehicle operating costs. The
Government learnt that maintenance must be carried out regularly to avoid premature
need for rehabilitation.

Since the introduction ofthe NRA, management has considerably improved. However,
the volume of work involved in dealing with the huge backlog is placing a strain on
the capacity of the NRA. Provision of technical assistance will give a much needed
boost to help the NRA to cope with the workload while tackling the road maintenance
backlog Force account methods have been replaced by contracting out to the private
sector.

Linkage with other operations

The EDF ﬁnanced PROSCARP programme, which addresses issues of soil
conservation, enhancement of food production and marketing of surplus food,
encompasses a number of sites in the project areas. The Microproject programme for
€15,000,000 (1999-2002) will beneﬁt from the rehabilitation in ensuring better access
to poor communities. The EC budget ﬁnanced 3 year Food Security Programme 1999
- 2001 will beneﬁt from improved access to distribution sites.

The Road Management Support Programme was approved by the EDF Committee in
December 1997 for a total of€l7,400,000 to support backlog I‘naintenance on roads
previously ﬁnanced by the EDF, and also addresses road safety, axle loading and other

 

2.7

institutional improvements, The operation of the completed Dwangwa-Nkhata Bay
road, ﬁnanced by the EDF and KM, is clearly dependent on this project. The World
Bank ROMARP programme, scheduled to start in 2000, will complement this
programme.

Results of economic and cross-sector appraisals

Economic analyses were carried out for both the Mangochi to Monkey Bay road
maintenance and for the M5 bridge replacement programme. For the road section, the
main economic beneﬁt is the reduction in vehicle operating costs due to the improved
surface condition whereas, for the bridges component, the main benefit is the reduces
vehicle operating costs due to the substantial reduction in distance. The analysis
period for both has been taken as 15 years and the costs include normal and periodic
maintenance ofthe project during this period.

The design consultants for the road section carried out an environmental analysis and
concluded that the project would have a relatively low impact on the environment
what there is would occur mainly during the two-year construction period. For the
bridges component, the nature of the works did not warrant a detailed analysis but the
tender documents d0 incorporate the normal safeguards.

The employment of women on the project will be encourages as it is recognised that
many households are headed by women. The projects will clearly impact on
agriculture, the mainstay of Malawi’s economy, affecting both the rural subsistence
farmer and the larger commercial operations such as the sugar and ﬁshing industries.
Improved accessibility will also boost the tourism industry.

IMPLEMENTATION

Physical and non-physical means

Rehabilitation of the Mangochi to Monkey Bay road, including sub—base and base,
surfacing, drainage and bridge works, supervised by a suitably qualified consulting
engineering firm. Annex 2 gives details ofthe technical aspects of the project. The
Government through the National Roads Authority is required to provide funding for
routine and periodic maintenance, during the life ofthe road,

The bridges component of the project includes the replacement of the old bridges on
the M5, involving removal of temporary Bailey structures on the Kasangadzi,
Liwaladzi and Kalwe rivers and construction of new box culverts in the same
locations; and replacement of the Lisasadzi bridge on the M1 after demolition and
removal ofthe old damaged bridge.

The main element of the bridge programme will be the completion of the new bridge
and approach roads at the Dwambazi river. The new crossing will comprise a new
four span, 120 metre long, bridge founded on piles, with a composite steel and
concrete deck. The realignment ofthe route will entail the construction of about 4 km
of roads to the same standard as the existing Dwangwa—Nkhata Bay road. This will
have a 6.7 metre wide carriageway with 1.5 metre wide shoulders. Land take from
outside the present road reserve will be required and the land occupied by the
abandoned section will be rehabilitated and made available for agricultural use.

 

3.2

3.3

Technical Assistance to the National Roads Authority will be provided by
international consulting engineers.

Organisational and implementation procedures

The Chief Executive of the National Roads Authority, under which the responsibility
for the project falls, will be nominated as the Supervisor. Works contracts above
65,000,000 will be awarded by open international tender. Works contract over
€1,000,000 and under €5,000,000 will be awarded following accelerated tender
procedures as provided for in Article 301 ofthe Lome l'V Convention. The Supervisor
will be assisted in his duties by supervision teams recruited following consultations
with local and regional consulting firms, or restricted tenders, depending on the
values, in accordance with EDF regulations.

The works, following mobilisation and until Provisional Acceptance, are expected to
take 12 months. The Final Acceptance Certiﬁcates will be issued at the end of the

. maintenance periods of one year from the acceptance of each section.

The technical assistance to be provided to the National Roads Authority will be
mobilised through a restricted international invitation to tender in accordance with
normal EDF procedures. All project contracts will be managed on behalf of the
Contracting Authority (NAO) by the National Roads Authority as the Supervisor.
Since this will be one of the ﬁrst major projects to be managed by the new institution,
the technical assistance to be provided under the project will play an important role,
This foresees on-the-job training of the staff of the National Roads Authority in
contract administration, and maintenance planning and procurement.

Appropriate technology

The project will follow locally and internationally established practices for
construction and rehabilitation of roads and bridges. The pavement design was carried
out using normal international methods that take into account the forecast number of
equivalent standard axles over the intended design life and the subgrade strength, The
box culverts were designed to international standards to cope with a 50 year ﬂood,
with appropriate measures to prevent erosion and scour at the inlets and outlets. The
Dwambazi Bridge has been designed to international standards, using an efficient steel
and concrete composite deck, with piled foundations. The bridge has been designed to
accommodate a 100-year ﬂood.

The width ofthe road will cope with the forecast traffic growth throughout the design
life, so that no major works will be necessary before the end of this period. Off—
pavement maintenance operations over the design life will be normal, consisting
mainly of routine maintenance on drainage and structures. Maintenance operations on
the pavement will consist of patching/sealing of cracks and a rescaling with a surface
dressing twice during the design life.

The quality of the works will be ensured through careful selection of competent
contractors, following an accelerated tender.

3.4 Timetable; Cost and ﬁnancing plan

A timetable for the different works is given as Annex 3.

 

3.5 Special conditions and accompanying measures to be taken by the government
The Government of Malawi undertakes to:
i) Ensure no delay is caused to possession ofthe sites by the contractor by completing
. v acquisition of all land, including that designated for quarries and borrow pits and
paying any compensation due for buildings, crops, royalties, etc according to the
approved works programme. These costs are to be paid from the National Budget.
ii) Make provisions through the Road Fund ofthe National Roads Authority for funds
to ensure proper maintenance of roads in the amounts recommended in the
approved reports arising out of the RMI studies approved by Government (1997)
and endorsed by donors in the transport sector (EC, World Bank and KfW) and
according to subsequent letters of agreement with the Delegation of the European
Commission (see Annex 4).
iii) Ensure compliance with statutory regulations, particularly with respect to axle
loads. ‘
iv) Develop a proactive stand in re-negotiating the bilateral agreements with
neighbouring countries in the SADC region to ensure full and free competition
across international road transport operation.

4. Monitoring and Evaluation

4.1 Monitoring arrangements and follow-up
The various works contracts will be supervised on site, on behalf of the National
Roads Authority, by experienced firms of consulting engineers, The works will be
subjected to continuous inspection and testing to ensure quality. Monthly reports will
be produced by the Supervisor’s Representatives on each contract, detailing progress,
problems, financial status and any other relevant issues. The National Roads
Authority will be the Supervisor with responsibility for administering both the works
and services contracts. The Supervisor will ensure that the Contracting Authority and
the EC Delegation are kept informed throughout the implementation ofthe project.

 

Quarterly reports will be prepared by the team of Technical Assistants in the NRA,
describing actions taken to improve the operational efficiency ofthe organisation and
commenting on achievements and follow-up actions required.

4.2 Reviews/evalnations/audits: procedures and reports
A mid-term review of the implementation of each of the infrastructure components
will be carried out by the technical assistance team in the NRA. This will be
- independent ofthe progress reports submitted by the Supervisor’s Representatives.

The ﬁnal construction reports submitted by the Supervisor’s Representatives at theend
of the maintenance periods, will comment on the success of implementation of each
project component. They will include an evaluation to conﬁrm baseline indicators,
such as trafﬁc volumes, travel times and an updated calculation ofthe internal rate of
return based on the actual project costs and revised trafﬁc projections.

 

 

ANNEXES A-B

These annexes contains information regarding external elements likely to be
signiﬁcant for a successful outcome of the project as well as regarding factors,
which may ensure the viability of the project. It is provided for information only
and does not form part ofthis Financing Agreement.

ASSUMPTIONS

Risks and assumptions relating to implementation

Ensuring this project contributes to achieving an appropriate, sustainable and cost
effective network depends on the Government of Malawi continuing to implement and
sustain road policy and institutional reforms. The key assumption to the success ofthe
project is that the road maintenance policy will be applied and that the Road Fund of
the National Roads Authority will have sufﬁcient funds available to ensure proper
maintenance of the project roads and bridges. Annex 6 outlines the institutional
measures which have been taken and summarises the assistance being provided under
the Road Management Support Programme. The establishment of the National Roads
Authority and a dedicated Road Fund has provided considerable conﬁdence that the
project will be maintained over its design life. Assistance under the Road
Management Support Programme will ensure that suitable maintenance management
systems will be in place by the time the project is completed

Any delays on construction that may occur would postpone the benefits and could
cause higher costs due to price escalation and suspension costs. The Government will
provide funds to compensate for land acquisition It is assumed that the works will be
carried out by competent contractors and will be diligently supervised by a
professional firm of consultants, Following foundation investigations and testing, the
risk of encountering unexpectedly difﬁcult ground conditions with consequent cost
increases is low. Materials surveys that have been carried out have minimised the risk
of there not being sufﬁcient material available to meet requiren'ients. Nevertheless, a
physical contingency has been built into the cost estimate.

Measures ensuring sustainability

Ownership by beneficiaries

The project road and bridges form elements of the main road network, for which the
NRA has the responsibility for management and maintenance. Thus the NRA has
been intimately involved in the preparation ofthe projects and will be responsible, as
Supervisor, for administering all ofthe works and services contracts necessary for the
implementation ofthe programme. Maintenance of the project will be ﬁnanced from
the Road Fund.

1.2

1.3

1.4

 

 

Cross—sector sustainability

The main social beneﬁts ofthe project will be better accessibility to the project areas.
The rehabilitation ofthe Mangochi to Monkey Bay road will bring about a higher level
of service ofthe road. The restoration ofthe MS route will re—open access to and from
the Nkhata Bay district; and will restore the etlicient transport route between the north
and the main industrial and commercial centre of Blantyre, in southern Malawi. The
cost of both goods and passenger transport will fall, and journey times will be greatly
reduced. Road safety on the project routes will be greatly enhanced.

These improvements will have direct beneficial impact on the sustainability of other
sectors by reducing costs of agricultural inputs, making products more marketable,
improving access to health centres and schools, etc. The immediate direct impact on
poverty alleviation will be through employment during the realisation of the project.
Women will have employment opportunities on the project during the period of
construction.

National policy measures

It is the policy ofthe Government of Malawi to ensure that maintenance of all trunk
roads is carried out to protect investments made in upgrading the road infrastructure
and to train Malawi personnel in the skills required to design, build and maintain this
infrastructure.

To this end, the Government of Malawi embarked on the Road Maintenance Initiative,
resulting in the enactment of legislation to enable the establishment of the National
Roads Authority and a dedicated Road Fund. The Roads Board was appointed in
August 1997, starting the process of reform with the recruitment of the Chief
Executive to manage the NRA. A master plan, approved by Government, set out the
reform program which resulted in the complete hand over of the responsibility for
managing the road network to the NRA by 1999. The sustainability of policy reforms
is ensured by an excellent dialogue, and the fact that the private sector enjoys a
majority representation on the Roads Board.

Institutional and management capacity

The institutional reforms which have established the new National Roads Authority,
will certainly lead to a situation in which the management of the road network will be
more efficient and effective, In the meantime, technical assistance is being provided
under the EDF financed Road Management Support Programme to help the NRA to
establish sound management systems,

The National Roads Authority was established in August 1997 and has taken over
complete responsibility for routine maintenance. A dedicated Road Fund, which
receives funding mainly from the road users through a fuel levy, has been operating
since April 1998 and provides the bulk of routine maintenance ﬁnancing. Over the
coming year, the NRA will take over all the remaining functions from the Ministry of
Transport and Public Works, which has already reduced in size. The Government is
currently considering a proposal to gradually increase the size of the Road Fund so
that by the year 2002 it can ﬁnance all maintenance needs. The NRA will, according
to the law, also be responsible for other aspects of road maintenance such as axle load
control and it will play a significant role in road safety management.

 

1.5

1.6

Complementarity and sector co-ordination between donors

The EU, World Bank and, to a lesser extent, the KtW are the main donors in the road
transport sector in Malawi. All three have supported the institutional reforms which
led to the establishment ofthe NRA and the Road Fund. The World Bank ROMARP
programme is helping to address the maintenance backlog and will also finance some
essential road rehabilitation works. The KlW programme is somewhat smaller but
complementary, ﬁnancing some backlog maintenance and bridge rehabilitation works,

Economic and ﬁnancial sustainability

An economic analysis for the rehabilitation of the Mangochi to Monkey Bay road was
conducted in 1999. The analysis, based on the comparison ofthe "with" and "without"
project realisation cases, leads to the determination of the principal economic
feasibility indicators: Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Net Present Value (NPV) at a
discount rate of 12 per cent, First Year Rate of Return (F‘I’RR) and the optimum year
of opening. The study compared the discounted costs of implementing and
maintaining the project with the discounted beneﬁts arising from the project? over the
15 year design life with residual value at the end. The costs of the project are the
estimated rehabilitation cost plus the costs of routine maintenance and periodic reseals,
whereas the beneﬁts are the reductions in vehicle operating costs based on detailed
trafﬁc studies and forecasts.

The project has been subjected to a range of sensitivity tests to examine the robustness
of the economic base case in the event of more pessimistic assumptions about trafﬁc
forecast, construction costs, benefits and discount rate. The economic internal rate of
return is estimated at an average of 18.4 % (base case) indicating that the project is
economically viable.

The replacement of damaged bridges on the M5 will result in the reinstatement of an
existing route which includes a 132 km section which was co—ﬁnanced by the EDF and
KfW and completed in 1995. Due to the wash away ofthe Dwambazi bridge. during
the 1998/1999 rainy season, the route was rendered inoperable, thus seriously
diminishing the economic and ﬁnancial benefits of the original project. There is no
alternative to constructing a new crossing over the Dwambazi river. Therefore, the
analysis has assumed the beneﬁts of the project to be the reduction in road user costs
for major transport operators by not having to use the long alternative route through
Mzuzu and Kasungu. The project costs have been taken as the initial construction
costs plus the maintenance costs over the period ofthe analysis.

ANNEX 4 THE NATIONAL ROADS AUTHORITY AND THE ROAD MANAGEMENT
SUPPORT PROGRAMME

The sustainable existence of the National Roads Authority is dependent on several factors, not least of
which 15 a steady and dependable source of funding. The Road Fund was established for this purpose
and 15 protected by the National Roads Authority Act (1997). The main source of revenue for the
Fund is the fuel levy (although other user charges, such as licence fees, will probably be added in the

future),  disbursement from the Fund is strictly controlled by the Roads Board which has a
majority private sector representation.

Since the Roads Board was formed in 1997, road management ﬁinctions have slowly moved away
from the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (formerly Works and Supplies) to the National
Roads Authority and the process should be completed by the year 2000, after which the Government
will retain responsibility only for policy matters. The programme of reforms, along with a
commitment to increasing the size of the Road Fund over the period between 1998/1999 to 2002/2003,
has given donors the conﬁdence to contribute towards the backlog maintenance costs. Road user
charges currently account for about 60% of the total but, by 2002/2003, the full maintenance
requirement of 20 MEURO per annum will be met from road user charges. Until such time and,
providing the government keeps to commitments, support is being provided (SAF HI and SAF IV) to
‘top-up’ the fund while backlog periodic maintenance programmes are being financed separately
under donor programmes, including the Road Management Support Programme.

To support the National Roads Authority in its initial years of operation, the EDF financed Road
Management Support Programme will provide valuable assistance to all aspects of the organisation.
Institutional support is being provided through a technical assistance team, which is helping to
establish sound management systems and procedures; and through the provision of essential resources
including some ofthe vehicles and equipment. In addition to general administration management
systems, the assistance will extend to road network maintenance planning and implementation. Staff
training will be provided through both ‘on-the—job‘ training and through training institutions.

The programme will provide training to the private sector to help to build up capacity to cope with
increasing workloads. This will probably be delivered through the existing Ministry of Transport and
Public Works Training Centre in Lilongwe.

Vehicle weighing stations will be upgraded with new facilities and equipment to ensure that axle load
controls are easily enforced. These will include all border post stations, and three inland stations to
monitor local traffic. The National Roads Authority will assume responsibility for axle load control
during the coming year. Although it may contract out the actual operation of weighing stations, it will
retain a core team to monitor performance of, them. The programme will assist with training of
officials.

While the National Road Safety Council is responsible for co—ordinating road safety programmes, the
NRA will have a clear technical role to play, to ensure that safety aspects are embodied in all road
programmes. The road management support programme will ﬁnance specific road safety
improvement schemes.

The largest single allocation of finance under the Road Management Support Programme is directed at
carrying out periodic maintenance on sections of the paved road network which were originally
rehabilitated! constructed using EDF ﬁnance. Some sections are simple to deal with, requiring only
minor repairs, shoulder and drainage reinstatement, rescaling and road marking. Other sections are
more deteriorated and will need some extensive pavement repairs, particularly the old section on the
Blantyre—Chikwawa escarpment. The overall timetable, for implementing the Road Management
Support Programme, is three years, having started at the beginning of 1999.
