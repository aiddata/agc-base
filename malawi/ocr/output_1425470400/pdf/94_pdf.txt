Introduction.

/

\‘alid International (VI) and Valid Nutrition (V N) are two separate entities. Valid
international is a humanitarian commercial consultancy company specialising in
nutritional research. advice and evaluation. VI along with Concern. and funded by lrish
Aid. did the research which led to the policy changes around the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition (SAM) and the adoption in practice of CTC (CMAM). V N was formed
consequent to the success of CTC to develop the indigenous production of the low cost,
high quality Ready to Use foods essential to CTC (CMAM). V1 and V N have two separate
governance and organisational structures and two separate staff cohorts. Steve Collins
and Al Hallam are the two partners of V I and as they are also Directors of VN. along with
Howard Dalzell, there is close collaboration between the two organisations. However the
small farmer research programme is a programme of V N with no formal management

input from \71.
General

1. What are the expectations and justification of V1 to support this proposal? Total
budget of €772k represents a very expensive proposal - with many other potential
alternate uses of these funds. How does VI justify this to potential funders ? What
financial contribution is VI planning to make?

RUTF has traditionally been manufactured in France with all the extra costs entailed and
the consequence that all the food costs (more than 50% of total costs) of CTC are external
to the local economy. There is now significant interest in manufacturing it in America
using American grown groundnuts. VN has shown that it is possible to produce good
quality RUTF in African countries and at highly competitive costs. Our prices are now
only 75‘}? of imported RUTF costs of four years ago. In practice this means that an extra
300/? of children can be treated for the same cost. This is in spite of enormous difficulties
in obtaining low aflatoxin peanut butter and indeed import from other countries.

The research will demonstrate if it is possible to train small holders to produce high
quality butter which will lead to improvement in their livelihoods and to signiﬁcant import
substitution, while opening up the possibility of export markets for internationally
acceptable groundnuts. The policy implications are significant in terms of the total
‘Africanisation’ of CMAM and the use of donor funds in treatment of SAM. The
projected demand for RUTF by 2015 is 55.000 tons per annum or $250 million at current

indigenous costs.

The total cost of €772k of the multi-country, multi—agency project is spread over four
years in four countries. Almost 35% of this cost is for a high-level research coordinator to
pull together the findings from the different countries and ensure effective dissemination
of the results for policy inﬂuence. The total cost would be reduced to €530k if this staff
member was removed and coordination managed by a part-time VN manager.

VN has funded the full cost of more than €10,000 in the research in Malawi in 2010 not
including pro-bono inputs from the coordinator. VN will continue funding at this level
when it has an assured income stream from manufacturing sources. The cooperating
NGO’s provide assistance in kind by way of local transport, accommodation and
administration

2. In respect to methodology, it would be useful to get a bit more detail about what
is being proposed, what efforts are being made to avoid duplicating work already carried
out, what efforts will be made to ensure data being collected, and collection methods
agreed, is appropriate and will yield high quality information to inform the study outcome.

The coordination of research work by UCC will lead to standardisation of information
gathering across all contexts and agencies. The intention is to use a standard livelihoods
and food security questionnaire covering vulnerability; assets and policies; institutions and
processes; together with current income and food security levels and strategies.

 

 

Collaboration with indigenous colleges will be especially valuable in assessing the effects
of changes in the policy environment in each country. The livelihoods survey will be
carried out with the same participating farmers at the start of the project. half way through
the project and at the end of the project and with a statistically significant control sample.
Results will thus be gathered on production from three growing seasons. The participation
of N605. and in Malawi. 21 private sector company, will ensure continuity.

Valid International will assist with nutrition assessments of children in participating
families in the later stages of the programme in Malawi in order to assess food status as
opposed to income Status.

The initial development and ongoing monitoring of a value chain for groundnuts will

enable assessment to be made of any changes, in addition to those resulting from sales to
VN. brought about by improving farmers awareness of aflatoxin, their ability to produce
high yields ofhigh quality crop and the development of additional outlets for groundnuts.

Networking with NASFAM and a range of in—country actors will ensure that there is no
duplication of efforts. Other interested parties are Exagris. Gorta and Concern Universal.
Survey work in 2010 focussed on Exagris and Gorta farmers.

3. The outputs (#9) in the proposal are not well defined and as currently structured,
would not provide a basis for IA funding support. (I am less interested in ﬁnding out how
many Master's thesis this will generate than what implications this will have for
policy/practice in the years ahead). Given the very substantial budget requested - this
needs to be well elaborated. (It would be very important to reference these to # 1 above.)

Research Outputs
VN’s hypothesis is that it is the treatment of acute malnutrition will be economically and

socially more effective and less costly if small scale investments are made in local
agriculture and food processing as opposed to importing food from developed countries—
“the farm to mouth system makes sense”

The overall research objective is to demonstrate the effects of establishing assured markets
for high quality groundnuts (and later for other crops) on smallholder food security and
livelihoods so as to create an evidence based policy rationale to support enhanced local
production of RUTF. The evidence gathered during research will provide information on
the following issues:

1. The effect of short chain access to assured markets on small farmer household
livelihood strategies; income; and food security levels. These effects will be gender
disaggregated.

2. The extra costs and finance sources needed for improved production and an
assessment of farmers attitudes to the inevitable increase in risk.

3. The effect on general market prices for groundnuts of an assured market for
quality product. It is evident that much of the Malawian product is currently exported to
South Africa at a huge mark—up for the middlemen in spite of high aﬂatoxin levels. The
market has therefore scope to respond to increased prices for better quality by raising
general prices. This would be good for farmers but maybe not so good for VN!

4. The effect, including export opportunities, on the overall groundnut value chain
of the availability of high phyto-sanitary quality product. e.g. diversiﬁcation into
processed products such as oil, roast peanuts, small-scale local baked products. high
quality supermarket outlets, animal feed production, etc,

5. The effect on RUTF prices of a reliable local source of low aflatxoin groundnut
paste.

6. The effects of any government policy changes on the groundnut value chain.

7. Awareness of the key points in processes to ﬁx mutually advantageous contracts

in short chain transactions and means of protecting small holders in such processes.

This evidence will be contained in a signiﬁcant number of published outputs from the
research, including:

 

12 Masters‘ theses (3 for each country)

Occasional papers on specific emerging issues
Publication in 20 ll of interim multi-country reports
Final publication of results in end-2013/early20l4.

O O O C

These various outputs will be used as the basis for publishing papers in peer-reviewed
joumals. Such papers will provide an objective base for high-level policy inﬂuence. The
policy makers to be inﬂuenced are the major bilateral and multilateral donors and host

governments in the four progranune countries.

Dissemination of results will be partially through the publications outlined above. and also
through:

annual discussions and fora with farmers. participating NGOs and policy-makers in
each country

0 presentations at relevant conferences

a major end-of-programme international dissemination conference involving key
policy-makers at international level.

4. How this proposal links with VI plans for entering into purchasing agreements
with smallholders in Malawi? Will this occur concurrently or are these agreements already
in place? How will one initiative relate to the other?

The research will be carried out on the livelihoods of farmers contracted to supply
groundnuts to the paste processor supplying Valid Nutrition. As noted in the introduction
VN is the organisation involved in this project. Annual negotiations between the
producers and paste processor will take place before the planting season. Formal contracts
will be agreed with farmers. The price ﬁxing negotiations and agreements will be
carefully documented for future analysis and be based on consideration of all production,
post harvest handling and storage costs; export prices: local market prices; standard
groundnut quality parameters; and aﬂatoxin levels.

5. Much of the emphasis on the text is on supporting the work of UCC in engaging
with this proposal. Reference is also made to plans to establish institutional linkages with
Bunda College. It would be useful to get more detail about the planned respective
responsibilities/contributions of UCC/Bunda College for the duration of the proposal. (Are
there opportunities also, for example, of involving Masters students from Bunda College?)

The role of Bunda College in 2010 was informal in that graduate students were used as
enumerators. The more formal proposed interaction is that Bunda College. through
students, would monitor the effects of changes in value chains, market structures and
prices and in government policies towards the promotion of smallholder agriculture such
as input availability and credit facilities. As envisaged at present the livelihood surveys
would be led by UCC graduate students with survey work undertaken by Bunda students.

6. It would be useful also to get more information about the planned structured
relationship with Nasfam and also what role will the VI office in Malawi have in engaging
with the planned research?

Discussions with NASFAM are at an advanced stage in relation to the development by
NASFAM of a paste-processing unit to be operational early in 2011. VN has formally
conﬁrmed to NASFAM that it will purchase 35% of its paste requirement from NASFAM
subject to price and quality. As NASFAM intends to reach export markets for paste it
should be able to meet VN Aﬁatoxin standards. Highly conﬁdential discussions are
underway with NASFAM and Exagris about a closer formal tie—up between the three
organisations in relation to the entire RUTF production process. Each of the above

developments will ensure that there is a short and tight mutually beneficial chain from
field production of groundnuts to final production of RUTF and this will facilitate the
contract negotiation and traceability of groundnuts from farmers to final product and
hence the authenticity of the research.

As indicated above VI will not have a formal role in the management of the research.
