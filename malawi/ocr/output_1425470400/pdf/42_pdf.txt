I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The HIV AIDS pandemic rages relentlessly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Women, infants and
children account for more than 60% of new HIV infections. Each year, globally, half a
million children become infected with HIV. Most of these infections are in developing
countries, and more than 90% come from mother-to-child transmission. Without
intervention, there is a 30-45% chance that, in breastfeeding populations, a baby born to an
HIV positive (HIV+) mother will become infected.

Malawi, ranked as one of the world’s poorest nations, also has one of the highest HIV AIDS
prevalence rates. The N80 projected that in 2007 about 80,000 HIV positive women gave
birth, and of the exposed infants, only 15.3% received any prophylaxis. Recognizing the
urgent need to address the growing infection through vertical transmission, the Government
of Malawi (GOM) initiated a Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT)
programme in 1999. The roll-out saw limited progress until 2007 when the Ministry of
Health (MOH) initiated a five-year scale up plan. This programme has resulted in impressive
growth, but severely limited resources hinder the comprehensive roll out of high quality
servnces.

Numerous challenges and bottlenecks impede the programme. These include a critical
shortage of human resources in the health sector, a poorly managed and inconsistent supply
chain, resulting in frequent stock outs of essential drugs and diagnostics, inadequate
infrastructure, poor transport services, and difficulties in community mobilisation and lack of
male involvement which hinders uptake of services and good adherence to drug regimens.
Additionally there are many difficulties in establishing effective home-based care, without
which it is almost impossible to achieve comprehensive patient care and follow through.

The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI) has focused on expanding HIV/AIDS care
globally. CHAI has worked to lower the cost of treatment worldwide, partnered with
governments to implement large-scale treatment and prevention programmes, expanded
access to treatment in rural areas, and helped make treatment universally available for
children. In 2007 CHAI launched a global effort in PMTCT.

In 2008 CHAI-Malawi plans to support the national PMTCT programme of the GOM whose
vision is an HIV-free generation. CHAI’s plan is to help achieve this vision by supporting the
comprehensive and effective implementation of all elements of the Malawi Ministry of Health
(MOH) PMTCT programme in the Machinga District, population 447,243. CHAI-Malawi has
already participated in writing Malawi’s updated ART and PMTCT guidelines.

For this proposal, CHAI has developed a comprehensive set of eight strategic actions aimed
at achieving success in prevention of infection through two primary targets:

0 A significant increase in the full range of uptake of PMTCT services
0 A dramatic decrease in the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT)

At all stages of the project CHAI will implement interventions only after consultation with
and approval from all national and local leadership in the health sector. The project plan
provides for the rapid acceleration of infrastructural enhancements in order to satisfactorily
service the intended increase in patients accessing care. CHAI will work closely with the
MOH on high quality monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in accordance with their guidelines,
and will also provide additional assessments of the programme in cooperation with the MOH
and DHO. Activities will also be evaluated to ensure sustainability. In partnership with the
Malawi MOH, CHAI Malawi will engage aggressively to demonstrate success in the PMTCT
programme in the target district in order to create a pathway for success nationwide.

This proposal requests funding from the Government of the Kingdom of Norway for
comprehensive PMTCT support in the selected district of Machinga. The budget is
approximately $618 for each of 8,613 HIV+ mother-infant pairs in care, or $5.33 million
over three years. CHAI could later support a second district if additional funds are available.

I I . CONTEXT
1. GLOBAL HIV & PMTCT CONTEXT

HIV is a global pandemic that disproportionately affects women and young children. In 2007
an estimated 33.2 million people were living with HIV worldwide, including about 15.4
million women and 2.5 million children under the age of 15. In sub-Saharan Africa, women,
infants and children account for more than 60% of new HIV infections. Each year, half a
million children become infected with HIV. Most of these infections are in developing
countries, and more than 90% come from mother-to-child transmission (also called vertical
transmission) during pregnancy, labour and delivery, or breastfeeding. Without intervention,
there is a 30-45%1 chance that a baby born to an HIV-infected mother will become infected.

The most effective way to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV involves treatment
with triple antiretroviral drug regimens and avoidance of breastfeeding. In high-income
countries, where these options have been available since the mid 19903, mother-to-child
transmission (MTCT) rates have been reduced to below 2%. In the developing world,
however, prevention programmes have been based primarily on the provision of a single-
dose of nevirapine for the mother and infant at the time of birth, and on exclusive
breastfeeding. For the last eight years, these interventions have been accepted as the most
logical in settings with limited health services and where follow-up was neither possible nor
expected. Most programmes focused solely on pregnant women who presented at antenatal
clinics. These efforts are hindered by low antenatal participation, poor access to testing and
counselling, and inadequate stocks of drugs at PMTCT sites. It is estimated that only 16%2
of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries were tested for HIV in 2006. While
this has increased from an estimated 10% in 2005, there is much that needs to be done to
reduce MTCT on a global scale.

2. CHAI GLOBAL PMTCT PROJECTS

The Clinton Foundation’s HIV/AI DS Initiative (CHAI) recognizes the urgent need to break
this cycle of new paediatric infections — the vast majority of which are caused by vertical
transmission. CHAI is working with 9 partner governments to demonstrate that it is possible
to dramatically reduce MTCT in resource-poor settings by increasing the delivery of
comprehensive and high quality PMTCT services. This is predicated upon offering a fee-
free, high quality package of PMTCT services, developed and scaled-up in partnership with
host governments and other NGO partners. CHAI is not involved in providing direct patient
care, but works with governments to enhance the scale-up of their PMTCT programmes, fill
gaps in infrastructure, train and support technical staff, improve the supply chain, and
develop appropriate interventions to ensure mother-infant follow-up.

The CHAI PMTCT programmes will support the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of
reducing maternal and child mortality. Each project expects to support the upgrade of
services offered at local health facilities and forge strong linkages with the community to
achieve universal coverage of the targeted population — women of child-bearing age (WCBA)
and children. The programmes also aim to increase the number of people across the
population who seek and receive HIV detection and treatment services.

3. MALAWI HIV & PMTCT
a. Situation Assessment

Malawi is a geographically small, landlocked country in Southern/Central Africa with a rapidly
increasing high density population, currently estimated at 13.6 million. Malawi, ranked as
one of the world’s poorest nations, also has one of the highest HIV AIDS prevalence rates.
As in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, infants born to sero-positive mothers account for the
majority of new HIV cases each year, accelerating the already dramatic spread of HIV.

Without intervention, the majority of these children will die in early infancy or by their
second birthdays. Moreover, sero-positive mothers may continue to put others at risk of
infection and/or have more at-risk pregnancies.

Malawi has twenty-eight geographical districts spread across vast rural distances and
communities are very poorly connected by extremely bad roads, many of which become
impassable in the rainy season. Each district is led by a District Commissioner or Chief
Executive and health services are administered by a District Health Officer (DHO).

In 1985, the first case of HIV in Malawi was reported. In 1989, the Malawi Government
announced a five-year AIDS plan, but it was not until 1994 that the new Malawi government
more fully recognized the wide-spread impact of this disease and the urgent need for
intervention. However, by this point AIDS had already damaged Malawi’s social and
economic infrastructure. This belated recognition of HIV/AIDS as a major health issue is
one of the reasons Malawi is now one of Africa’s most afflicted countries. AIDS related
diseases are a leading cause of death among Malawians and the links between AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria make the pandemic an increasingly significant global threat.

In response to the high prevalence of HIV in the population and rising mortality, the MOH
developed sophisticated Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) guidelines and is successfully
executing a national ART scale-up plan.

By the end of 2007, the scale-up had resulted in over 147,000 people ever initiated on
treatment with over 100,000 (68.5%) known to be alive and on treatment. This exceeded
the MOH target of 110,000 ever initiated. However, with a target of 90,000 (82%) alive and

of Health & National AIDS Commission (NAC)

on treatment, the mortality rate has been considerably worse than expected. Women
account for over 89,000 (61%) of those ever initiated and children account for nearly 12,000
(31%)“.

To date, the National AIDS Commission (NAC) estimates that 43.4% of adults and 40.3% of
children in need are receiving ARTS. The MOH recognizes this impressive ART scale up in
Malawi must be accompanied by aggressive HIV prevention strategies, both for adults and
for children (e.g. PMTCT). Without successful prevention efforts, the country will have little
chance of containing the HIV/AI DS epidemic.

With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$230, Malawi ranks number 201 out of
209 countries in the world, according to World Bank figures6. As a result, the MOH functions
with very limited resources, significantly reducing the impact it can have on the AIDS
pandemic in Malawi, and contributing to continued widespread infection.

b. Government Response

In order to effectively reverse the progression of HIV/AIDS, pregnant women are the critical
population group for success and must be targeted in order to reach a large portion of the
general population. The GOM fully recognizes it must reduce the high level of new
infections through vertical transmission by providing a high quality package of interventions
to pregnant women. Their enrolment in the PMTCT programme not only reduces the spread
of the disease, but provides an entry point to register HIV positive women and children into
HIV/AIDS care and treatment programmes. Without this vital entry point it is impossible to
achieve the critically needed increase in HIV/AIDS detection and treatment. The chart below
illustrates the commitment of the MOH to Maternal and Child Health Services and the
impressive scale up of the national PMTCT programme. The historical perspective of the
provision of PMTCT services in Malawi is as follows:

Most data sources indicate that anywhere from 80% to more than 90% of pregnant women
in Malawi attend ANC services at least once during their pregnancies8. However, a large
percentage of these women do not access the full range of ANC, L&D, and FP services,
resulting in limited uptake of all components of PMTCT care and treatment. Most Health
Centres face significant difficulty in fully implementing the guidelines due to a severe
shortage of resources and health personnel. This underscores the need for systems-
strengthening along with concentrated implementation assistance.

The WHO has a broad four-pronged approach to the prevention of vertical transmission:
1. Primary prevention of HIV infection.
2. Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV.
3. Prevention of HIV transmission from mothers living with HIV to their infants.
4. Care, treatment, and support for mothers living with HIV, their children, and families.

With this in mind, the GOM has expanded the scope and status of the PTMCT Programme,
declaring the three-fold vision of the programme to be:

1. Bring about an HIV free generation in Malawi

2. Reduce paediatric HIV infection

3. Improve the quality of life of parents living with HIV
The MOH has initiated a national 5-Year Scale-Up plan to drive achievement of this vision.
The Objectives of the MOH PMTCT Programme are as follows:

0 Offer routine HIV testing and counselling to all pregnant women, partners, and
families, and to all family planning clients.

0 Increase access to family planning services for HIV-positive WCBA.

0 Provide comprehensive, high quality PMTCT care, treatment, and support to
pregnant and lactating women and their families.

0 Strengthen the Maternal & Child Health (MCH) service delivery system through
integrating PMTCT activities in MCH and community services.

0. Challenges to the National PMTCT Programme
The MOH has identified the following challenges to successful implementation:

0 Programme implementation is often slow due to delayed disbursements of funds.

0 Shortage of staff at all levels.

0 PMTCT data management is not aligned with the Health Management Information
System (HMIS).

0 Weak linkages between maternal and child health for PMTCT to facilitate the
continuum of care leading to limited follow-up of H|V+ mothers and exposed infants.

0 Vertical HIV programme planning, implementation, and management has allowed
rapid expansion of HIV and other programmes but has led to missed opportunities to
fully integrate PMTCT into MCH and other relevant services.

0 Poor community mobilization including weak linkages between facilities and the
community, low levels of couple testing and counselling, and limited PMTCT uptake
limit enhanced support for women, children and family members living with HIV.

0 Scaling up provision of more efficacious ARV regimens for PMTCT.

Additionally the MOH has identified the following barriers and bottlenecks:

o Frequent stock-outs of HIV test kits.

 

8 MOH: Health Management Information Bulletin, Annual Report July 2006 -June 2007, May 2008
27 May 2008 — Not For Distribution Outside Recipient’s Organization Page 9 of 53

o Timely disbursement of funds from the Global Fund and partners to effectively
implement the PMTCT programme at the district level.

Inadequate infrastructure.

Insufficient and suboptimal staff housing makes retention of technical staff difficult.
Lack of involvement of male partners in PMTCT.

Inadequate laboratory equipment, supplies and services to support clinical care.

After extensive discussions with the MOH PMTCT Coordinator and Technical Assistant and
with implementing partners, and after conducting extensive and detailed site assessments,
CHAI has determined that the following gaps or challenges are key factors contributing to
the low PMTCT coverage in Malawi:

(1) Challenges in Community Mobilisation and Male Involvement

Lack of education and awareness of HIV related issues are still prevalent, particularly in rural
areas. About 50% of Malawian women give birth at home, with Traditional Birth Attendants
(TBAs) performing deliveries. Many are HIV+ but unaware of their status and/or not on ARV
treatment or prophylaxis. The infants of these mothers, and the women performing the
deliveries, are at heightened risk for infection. Common practices include early mixed
feeding and extended breastfeeding both of which heighten the risk of vertical transmission
of HIV.

Historically, Malawi’s culture has not empowered women and it is still difficult for women to
make safe choices around sex. Furthermore, many women still fear disclosing their HIV
status to partners, which may cause poor up-take of the full range of PMTCT services
(including delivering in health facilities) among pregnant women, poor adherence to
treatment, and failure to use Family Planning services. Lack of male involvement in
HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention increases the continued risks of infection and re-
infection for women. In concert with the scale-up of the PMTCT Programme the MOH has
instituted some effective community mobilisation measures, but further and sustained
interventions will be required to achieve measurable impact. Effective community
sensitisation has the potential not only to increase up-take of services by pregnant women
and thus prevent MTCT, but also to augment a climate of knowledge that helps reduce high
risk behaviours and enhance prevention activities. In fact, the prevention of MTCT properly
begins, not simply with pregnant women in ANC, but rather by providing all WCBA proper
education, a safer environment, and tools of enhanced empowerment. All of these efforts
will enable them to make safer personal and family health decisions that will prevent
infection and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies among infected women.

(2) Human Resource Challenges: Critical Shortage of Technical Staff
at Health Facilities9

The lack of adequate numbers of technical staff in health facilities is a major human
resource crisis in Malawi as indicated in the table below.

Table 5: Population per Qualified Health Professional

The WHO recommends that the minimum staffing for a health facility consists of two
clinicians (doctors, clinical officers or medical assistants), 2 nurses/midwives, and at least 1
environmental health officer or health assistant. However, in Malawi, only 6% of the 901
primary level facilities meet minimum staff norms (see Table 5 above).

Conditions are not favourable for health worker retention in government service. Among
those who left government service, 39% left because of low pay and 35% left because of
poor working conditionsg.

Currently Malawi faces an extremely high vacancy rate for nursing positions throughout the
country, and rural areas face the severest difficulty in securing technical staff. The shortage
of lab technicians who are critical to HIV diagnosis, care, and treatment, limits the country’s
ability to perform lab tests such as CD4 counts, haemoglobin tests, and liver function
monitoring. At the end of 2007, the government sector employed only 208 lab technicians
for the whole country.

The MOH has undertaken extensive PMTCT training but many workers either have not had
PMTCT training or require up-dated training in line with the new PMTCT guidelines to equip
them with the skills in testing, counselling and staging. Since the numbers of staff at most
facilities is already sub-minimal, when a staff member is absent (e.g., for training) no testing
or counselling can take place. The excessive work-load on the existing technical staff causes
extreme fatigue. PMTCT scale-up success will result in more patients in care and on
treatment which will, in turn, create an even greater burden on the already over-worked
health personnel.

(3) Infrastructure & Transport Challenges

The vast majority of health facilities were constructed prior to the onset of the HIV/AI DS
pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the number of people accessing health care still
falls substantially short of those who need it, the infrastructure capacity is currently
“bursting at the seams” and is often low quality, inadequately maintained, poorly serviced,
and in some cases, not fit for quality health care service delivery. Often, there simply is
insufficient space to meet current patient needs. Conditions are further exacerbated at rural
health facilities that lack electric power or a safe supply of running water.

The MOH’s PMTCT programme has the goal of increasing the uptake of pregnant women
accessing HCT and follow-up services. To support this scale-up of PMTCT services there is
an urgent need to supplement in innovative ways both the space available and infrastructure
quality at health centres and PMTCT sites.

Difficulties in transport, including lack of all types of vehicles for transport of patients and
supplies, create a major obstacle to quality health care service delivery. As Malawi has a
largely rural population and limited resources, health service providers with inadequate
transport are unable to offer laboratory, diagnostic, emergency, outreach, and other
services. The population (particularly pregnant women and small children) are often unable
to reach the health centres when most necessary.

Compounding this problem, severely inadequate and poorly or non-maintained roads limit
access even when transport is available. Universal access to transport within the project
area is essential for the provision of high quality PMTCT services, including community-
based and follow-up services.

Table 7: Infrastructure & Transport Challenges

 

3. Infrastructure & Transport Challenges

 

Most facilities built prior to HIV/AIDS pandemic

Inadequate space

Inadequate furniture and equipment

Inadequate power supply and safe running water

Sometimes below minimum standards of acceptability for human dignity
Inadequacies of laboratory services

Structures not designed for effective flow and linkages of PMTCT services
Poor roads and long distances for patients from home to nearest health centres
Lack of transport for patients (private cars, bicycles, taxis, mini-buses, buses,
ambulances)

 

 

 

(4) Supply Chain Challenges

The ability to deliver effective PMTCT services is impossible without the ability to supply the
appropriate diagnostics, prophylactic and treatment drugs, contraceptives, nutritional
products, and supplements. This requires efficient, safe, and effective clearing, storage, and
distribution (CSD) of all products and materials used in the health system.

Malawi’s Central Medical Stores are facing extreme challenges. Supplies are often poorly
forecasted, ordered, and unevenly distributed. As a result, most PMTCT sites suffer
frequent stock-outs of various supplies and there is little buffer-stock available. Rural health
facilities are more severely affected than Central or District Hospitals.

A successful PMTCT programme requires a consistent and dependable supply chain that is
seamlessly connected to the health facilities within the project area. Addressing the national
health care supply chain system and resolving its issues will be beyond the scope of this
proposal. However, we will attempt to mitigate this issue for the selected district.

Table 8: Supply Chain Challenges

 

4. Supply Chain Challenges

 

o Inadequacies of sample transport systems from health centres to Districts and from
District to Reference labs

o Inconsistent supply chain

0 Stock outs of test kits, reagents, ARV’s, supplements

o Unavailability of diagnostics including CD4 and DNA PCR

 

 

 

(5) Challenges in Patient Care & Compliance

The challenges in education, community mobilisation and male involvement also have a
significant effect on patient care and compliance. In addition, severe food insecurity,
particularly in many rural areas, contributes to poor compliance and response to treatment
as well as continuation of breast-feeding children well-beyond the age of six months. There
are high rates of default at many points in the PMTCT cascade.

27 May 2008 — Not For Distribution Outside Recipient’s Organization Page 13 of 53

Table 9: Patient Care & Compliance Challenges

 

U1

. Patient Care & Compliance Challenges

 

Cultural traditions for pregnancies and deliveries to occur outside of HF’s
Misinformation and lack of awareness regarding treatment availability and success
Fear of disclosure of status

Distances and lack of transport preclude patients accessing HF’s

 

High number of patient defaulters
Lack of resources to follow up on defaulters
Difficulties in adherence to drugs

 

Food insecurities increasing risks for HIV infected women and infants

Food insecurities causing complications in early cessation of breast-feeding
Cultural norms to breast-feed for extended periods up to 2 years

Cultural tendencies to wet nurse

 

 

Insufficient resources to provide consistent and effective outreach clinics
Insufficient training and numbers of health workers (see HR)
0 Insufficient resources to provide adequate psychosocial support

 

 

(6) Challenges Related to Integrated Service / Cascade Linkages

The challenges identified to this point cannot be addressed in isolation. The linkages among
solutions need to bring about integrated service delivery across the entire PMTCT cascade.
There are barriers or challenges to achieving this integration including facilities design,
“silos” in different segments of the health system, and access by patients to different parts
of the system. The current system requires many patients to make multiple visits with
separate appointments in different parts of the health system. Because of distance and lack
of transport, compliance is often impossible.

Table 10: Challenges Related to Integrated Service / Cascade Linkages

 

6. Challenges Related to Integrated Service/ Cascade Linkages

 

Physical facilities are not conducive to effective linkages

HIV not fully integrated into general health system

Excessive work-loads prohibit providers linking effectively

Patients lost due to complicated systems to access all components of care
Lack of M&E across components of the cascade

 

Services offered on limited days causing loss of care to patients

 

Providers unable to initiate effective follow-up of mother-infant pairs
0 Inadequate linkages among all components of PMTCT cascade

 

 

 

(7) Challenges in Community-Based Care and Follow-Up

The progression of HIV/AIDS in the nation has caused unprecedented and unparalleled
pressures on the health care system of Malawi, stretching its resources far beyond what is
feasible. In addition, the disease has placed severe stresses on households in the
communities, and has adversely affected traditional systems once in place that were
designed to care for those in need. A comprehensive approach to the prevention of MTCT
must involve whole families and have the support of an effective Community Health Worker
(CHW) system in order to increase patient care and compliance. CHW systems are in place
to a limited degree, but lack a sufficiently large cadre of CHW workers and an operational
reporting system that allows for reversal of loss to follow up (LTFU) of mother-infant pairs.

Table 11: Challenges in Community- Based Care and Follow-Up

 

N

. Challenges in Community-Based Care and Follow-Up

 

Long distances

Extremely bad and sometimes impassable roads
Lack of communication devices

Poor/insufficient addresses

Stigma

Traditional norms such as TBA deliveries

Insufficient human resources

Essential to have cooperation of local/village leaders

 

 

 

(8) Challenges in Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)

The Malawi MOH has a decentralized, largely paper-based M&E system with separate
registers and reporting tools for different components of care. In addition, health facilities
make up their own paper registries where centrally designed systems are absent. Relevant
tools in use in different parts of the health system include:

0 Patient master cards

0 Patient health passports.

o Registers for Ante Natal Clinics (ANC), Labour & Delivery Wards (L&D), Under-Five
Clinics (U5), Family Planning Clinics (FP), and the ART Programme.

0 A new MOH PMTCT Register has been developed but has not yet been printed and
distributed to all sites.

0 New MOH PMTCT Report (See Appendix 6)

In addition, the MOH and its technical working groups (TWGs) supply other useful reports.
These include PMTCT reports, El D reports, the HRH census, ART quarterly and annual
reports and ART (MS Excel) database, NAC Sentinel Surveys, and others. The major
challenge is that all these are separate data sources and are not tied into a single reporting
system. Likewise, there are typically no linkages between patients who appear in one
register to the same patient who appears in another register.

Manual copying, data entry, and analysis will be required to provide an integrated view of
performance of the whole PMTCT programme.

Table 12: M&E Challenges

 

8. M&E Challenges

 

0 Lack of registers in Health Facilities

0 Work overload prohibits consistent and accurate data entry into registers

0 Lack of supervision and consistent supervisory visits limits quality improvement and
compliance

d. CHAI ’5 Work In Malawi*

CHAI began its programmatic work in Malawi in 2006 and currently its activities fall into
seven key areas:

1.
2.

Policy advice, support, and technical assistance to the Ministry of Health (MOH)

Procurement and distribution of ARV and diagnostics for paediatric care as
well as for Adult 2nd line therapy.

Paediatric nutrition services for the MOH’s Out-Patient Therapy Programme (OTP)
to treat children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) through Community-based
Therapeutic Care (CTC)

Laboratory Services Programme to train Lab Assistants and to build, refurbish,
equip, supply and provide technical support for laboratories.

Paediatric programme development and support of paediatric HIV/AI DS outreach
and services, technical assistance with paediatric clinical trials, and support for the
MOH’s ART programme M&E.

Rural delivery of quality integrated health care services in partnership with
Partners In Health (PIH) in the Neno District.

PMTCT policy and programme development and support including Early Infant
Diagnosis (El D).

CHAI has been engaged with the MOH to influence and help write PMTCT policy and
guidelines. With the proposal that follows in Section III, CHAI is preparing to
engage in more intensive support. As part of the MOH’s PMTCT programme, this
intervention seeks to demonstrate the ability to scale up high quality, effective, and
comprehensive delivery of PMTCT services in one or more focused districts, thereby
achieving a dramatic reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV despite
Malawi’s resource-limitations.

|||. CHAI PROPOSED SOLUTONS
1. INTRODUCTION

CHAI will support the MOH in addressing the most fundamental elements of an effective
PMTCT service delivery system:

0 The need to reach and test all pregnant women.
0 The need to expand high quality services”).
0 The need to keep all sero-positive mother-infant pairs in the continuum of care.

The implementation plan will be guided as follows:

1. CHAI will operate within the guidelines of the MOH’s PMTCT Programme, and with
the approval of the national and local PMTCT leadership. CHAI will work to provide
supplementary interventions in the focal area in order to assist the MOH to offer and
effectively deliver a fully comprehensive and high quality package of PMTCT services.

2. CHAI will support the Ministry of Health in delivering high-quality PMTCT services at
scale with increased retention. This will also support expanded HIV/AIDStesting,
treatment, and care in the focused district to ensure delivery of the full continuum of

quality health care for women, children and men with HIV/AIDS.

Implementation of CHAI ’s proposed solutions will follow a phased approach to assist scale
up in order to dramatically reduce MTCT. The phases, while conceptually sequential, will
overlap in their implementation.

1° The MOH currently offers high quality PMTCT and maternal and child health services. Delivery of these
services is limited by the lack of resources to universally provide diagnostics, the inconsistent availability of
supplies, and the lack of health personnel. Consequently, CHAI will propose interventions to facilitate the
universal distribution of more effective regimens to prevent MTCT, as now approved by the National Guidelines
and provide additional resources to improve follow-through of mothers, infants and families, strengthening the
high quality services now provided by the MOH.

27 May 2008 — Not For Distribution Outside Recipient’s Organization

Page 17 of 53

The final phase is intended to drive sustainability of the PMTCT strategy and plan by
working with the MOH to document and distribute lessons learned. These will support
ongoing strategy development, planning, and management and will incorporate key
elements of the strategy into the country’s national PMTCT plan. Support for PMTCT will be
institutionalized in the government system and ultimately reflected in the national PMTCT
budget.

The activities and interventions detailed in this proposal were developed in consultation with
the MOH Coordinator and Technical Assistant of the national PMTCT Programme, and also in
consultation with the DHO and the PMTCT Coordinator at the District Level. Once approved,
the project will become operational with the buy-in, approval, and support of the DHO, the
District Nursing Officer (DNO) and the District PMTCT Coordinator (DPC) for the selected
district(s). Concurrently, CHAI will maintain sensitivity toward local communities and health
committees to ensure their concerns are addressed by the programme. A critical element of
the strategy to promote local ownership of this effort will be the involvement of all health
workers through a whole site training approach to help ensure eventual sustainability of the
interventions.

CHAI believes that a key element of a successful programme is setting ambitious yet
attainable targets. The primary thrust of CHAI Malawi’s PMTCT support initiative is to
demonstrate the feasibility of effective and comprehensive delivery and increased and
sustained up-take of the full range of PMTCT services in this resource limited setting,
thereby attaining a dramatic reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

2. VISION & MISSION FOR THE PMTCT PROGRAMME

 

3 . GOALS

CHAI has two major goals to be achieved over a three-year (36 month) timeframe starting
in July 2008 and ending in June 2011. By implementing the strategic actions outlined in this
proposal CHAI expects to support reduction of transmission of HIV in general and reduce
primary infections and unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV.

These overarching goals are:

a. In the selected district (see next section), dramatically increase the
percentage of pregnant women accessing the full range of PMTCT services to
at least 80% from the current 24.1% of pregnant women who were tested
for HIV in 2007".

b. Significantly decrease by at least 50% the rate of mother-to-child
transmission from the current 30-45% level to 15-22.5% , with a “stretch
target” of achieving a 70% reduction to a range of 9-13% .

4. SELECTION OF TARGET DISTRICT — MACHI NGA

Malawi is made up of 28 districts, all facing significant challenges in scaling-up the national
PMTCT programme. The MOH directed CHAI to select a focal district not currently served by
other partners. CHAI Malawi conducted intensive and extensive site assessments in four of
these districts. It was readily apparent that all districts face similar challenges, and all
could benefit from support. HIV prevalence levels vary significantly by region with the
Southern Region having significantly higher population and HIV prevalence. The Central
Region is more moderate, and the Northern Region has both significantly lower population
and HIV prevalence levels.

Consequently CHAI Malawi is proposing that the focal district for the PMTCT initiative be
Machinga in the southern region. Machinga District has the third highest HIV prevalence
rate in Malawi, at over 22%”. There are four ART sites in the district (Machinga DH, Ntaja,
Chikweo, and Namandanje), which might not be sufficient for the population served. Other
key factors make it an important but challenging target.

0 The primary language spoken (Chiyao) is not the national language, although
Chichewa is also understood.

0 The entire district borders Mozambique on the eastern side and a significant number
of people from Mozambique obtain services at Machinga health facilities.

0 Common Cultural Practices: Early marriage for girls (child brides), polygamy, girls’
initiation into sex; women are often “second class” members of society

0 A large section of Machinga District surrounds Lake Chilwa and its fishing district.

0 Many patients come from neighbouring Mangochi District, also a lake district.

0 A large percentage of the men in this district fall into two working categories that
both have significantly higher HIV prevalence rates in Malawi. Namely, business
men who travel frequently and for extended periods; and fishermen.

o The District Hospital is not geographically central in the district (it is in the extreme

west), causing additional difficulty for the transportation infrastructure.

Other than the District Hospital, all health facilities in the district are rural.

Low percentage of deliveries in health facilities.

Health centres are not currently providing CPT to any HlV+ pregnant women.

CD4 counts are currently only available at the District Hospital.

ART: Only 1.2% of patients ever initiated on ART through PMTCT13

stVP is currently the only HlV prophylaxis used.

El D is not yet available in the district.

The following data concerning population projections for the district of Machinga and PMTCT
activity in 2007 was provided by the MOH and the DHO and was collected on site by the
CHAI PMTCT Manager.

The current population projections for the district are as follows:

Using this data, CHAI has determined the potential impact of a successful increase in uptake
of high quality PMTCT interventions in the Machinga District. lf resources for PMTCT
services continue to be severely limited, as at present, 3000 - 4,500 infants will be infected
over the next three years. Of note is the fact that in 2007, the PMTCT programme in
Machinga District resulted in ARV prophylaxis for only 100-200 exposed infants.

6. PROGRAMM E MANAGEMENT

At all times we will keep in mind the two overarching goals of the MOH PMTCT programme
in section III “CHAI Proposed Solutions”, Sub-Section 3, “Goals” and their associated
measurements as repeated below.

1. Dramatically increase the percentage of pregnant women accessing the full
range of PMTCT services

2. Significantly decrease the rate of vertical transmission

Measuring performance will also require simultaneously loose and tight controls. By this, we
mean we will strive to maintain tight and precise control at a high level of a very small
number of key, measurable results, but only loose control over secondary variables that will
not materially affect the ultimate outcome and therefore are less important or meaningful.

Managing CHAl’s support of the Ministry’s PMTCT Programme requires using MOH reporting
data to help monitor the key indicators of success. These indicators fall into three
categories:

The indicators that follow are aligned with the eight strategic actions described previously.
Not all activities and results can be measured quantitatively. Therefore, qualitative
measurements are also included.

a. Key Indicators of Success

Note: In the MOH PMTCT programme, several registers are used for M&E. These include
registers for Ante Natal Clinics (ANC), Labour & Delivery Wards (L&D), Under-Five Clinics
(U5), Family Planning Clinics (FP), and the ART Programme. In addition, the MOH and its
technical working groups (TWGs) supply other useful reports. These include PMTCT reports,
EID reports, the HRH census, ART quarterly and annual reports and database, NAC Sentinel
Surveys, and others. All will be cited below as “MOH.”

b. Risk Assessment

There are many potential risks associated with the proposed interventions. CHAI will work
closely with GOM, MOH, District leadership and partners to minimize these risks.

Table 19: Risk Assessment

 

RI SK ASSESSM ENT

 

Risks

CHAI Actions to Mitigate Risk

 

1. Community sensitisation and male involvement
efforts may be insufficient to counter centuries
old traditions

Sustained and repetitive community
awareness campaigns

Sustained efforts to obtain the assistance and
positive influence of local and leaders
Targeted interventions to provide incentives
for male involvement

 

2. Proposed infrastructure enhancements will be
insufficient to deliver quality PMTCT services

Utilize innovative and creative methods to fully
utilize available space

 

3. Interim staffing efforts will be limited by
prospects for sustainability

Work with MOH and District Leadership to
optimize staffing on a District wide basis for
provision of PMTCT services

Supplement and raise skill levels of existing
staff through effective mentoring

 

4. Given the existing environment with a critical
national shortage of human resources,
interventions to enhance staffing in PMTCT
services may be insufficient to meet demand

Employ expert task shifting to optimize patient
loads with limited resources

Utilize available expertise to raise skill levels of
all existing staff - technical and HSAs - to
create more efficient patient flow and less
time for staff-patient interaction, while
offering the same quality of services
Incorporate technical devices for patient
education removing this burden from staff

 

5. Success in increasing up-take of PMTCT services
may overwhelm the system

Adopt a phased approach so that
infrastructure and other enhancements stay
ahead of increased up-take of services

 

6. CHAI support for the MOH PMTCT programme
will be partially dependent on successful delivery
of results by care partners

CHAI will maintain close interactions with care
partners and ensure that goals and
expectations are clearly communicated

 

7. MOH will be unable to sustain proposed
enhancements in infrastructure, staffing and
resources

CHAl’s intention is exit support in the focal
district(s) with enough infrastructure
enhancements in place to allow for
maintenance of the services. Every effort will
be made to increase up-take of services with
creative and sustainable human resource
interventions outlined above.

 

8. Despite demonstrating success in targeted areas
the MOH will lack the resources to effectively
scale up on a national level the full breadth and
scope of the services offered

 

 

Work with MOH to access additional funding
(e.g. GFATM, PEPFAR) to sustain these efforts
beyond the time constraints of this initiative
and to ensure trained leadership and
implementation staff are in place.

c. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

The MOH is highly committed to an effective and comprehensive M&E process and reporting
system. The Ministry emphasizes that its goal for high quality M&E is to give PMTCT staff
effective tools to assist them in providing quality services and effective patient follow up,
rather than only serving central reporting needs. To achieve this, the MOH has established
clearly prescribed M&E and data requirements including data recording, collection, analysis,
and reporting procedures.

CHAI will work with the MOH in the targeted area to help ensure that data and M&E as
outlined by the national PMTCT programme, is as comprehensive and accurate as possible.
CHAI will assist in enhancing the effective use of all M&E materials mandated by the MOH.
CHAI understands it does not have a mandate to go beyond the MOH’s well-defined M&E
requirements or to impose an unnecessary burden on the system, personnel, or partners.
Any suggestions for M&E improvement will be passed on to the MOH for their consideration,
but CHAI will not independently introduce any additional data collection or M&E
requirements.

The Ministry of Health has defined Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) as follows:

0 Monitoring is a regular, routine, systematic collection and analysis of information
monthly, quarterly and annually to track the progress of programme implementation
with the specific aim of improving service delivery.

0 Evaluation is the systematic examination and/or analysis of past decisions in order to
assess value, worth or impact, and to learn from them and improve. Evaluation takes
an objective look at the activities performed and identifies the reasons for both
success and failure, and how your future work can learn from both. It is normally not
routine, but carried out at specified periods.

Monitoring and evaluation helps programme implementers and service providers to:

Monitor the progress of programme implementation

Build on strengths in the implantation process

Identify areas requiring strengthening and take actions to rectify problems

Mobilize and utilize resources to implement programme activities, including
monitoring consumption of these resources

0 Evaluate the extent to which the programme is having or has had the desired impact
0 Assist the MOH to mobilize resources from treasury and from cooperating partners

The MOH recognizes the importance of maintaining complete records of patients in all
components of the PMTCT cascade including records from adolescent youth friendly health
services. To do so, the MOH provides periodic supervision to ensure quality M&E. They
further require and recognize:

o Accurate recording of information in registers, master cards, and health passports
results in timely, accurate and complete information that can be analyzed to
generate a report on utilization of services by the target population.

0 Record keeping and reporting of routine programme monitoring is useful to service
providers at the facility and program managers at district, zonal and national levels
for planning, management and resource mobilization and allocation to health
programmes.

0 Key PMTCT indicators for monitoring progress and quality of service delivery are
integrated into health passports and MCH registers and other complementary
registers such as HTC, family planning, and STI.

o PMTCT indicators have been integrated in the registers and Monthly Summary Report
Form (Appendix 11)

27 May 2008 — Not For Distribution Outside Recipient’s Organization Page 35 of 53

The National PMTCT Programme mandates the use of the following registers:

0 HTC Register 0 Postnatal Care and Follow-up Register
0 Antenatal Care Register 0 Under-five Register
0 Maternity Register 0 ART Register

The National PMTCT Programme requires the following data collection during delivery of
PMTCT services:

0 HIV information is recorded in Women, Child and Men Health Passports for every
patient who accesses services

0 HIV information and other relevant data is recorded in ANC, Maternal Services,
Family Planning and Postnatal Services

0 Registers are summarized at the end of each working day

0 These summaries are used for efficient care and follow up

A baseline study will be conducted at the inception of the project using a combination of
data already at the sites. All of the testing and treatment data will be collected from
standard registers in place at health care facilities through the National PMTCT Programme
M&E system as described above.

Throughout the duration of the project, CHAI will provide technical assistance to the specific
sites and at the district level to enhance M&E capabilities. Assistance will be provided as
needed to ensure that in operational level the existing system functions optimally. As
previously indicated, CHAI will not impose any additions to the existing M&E system.

d. PMTCT Programme M&E Support

CHAI will have a full-time M&E coordinator for the duration of project in order to effectively
collect and use MOH data and provide the programme with any needed analyses and
reports. CHAI intends to monitor and evaluate every aspect of implementation, with regular
feedback to the MOH for continuous improvement and to the donor to ensure appropriate
use of funds.

e. Establishing Pathway to Sustainability

Sustainability of this project will be a high priority through all levels of implementation. To
ensure we establish and follow a pathway to sustainability, the following will be key:

0 The MOH fully understands that CHAl’s initiative to support the national PMTCT
programme is limited to three years and other sources of funding will be needed for
continuation and expansion.

0 CHAI will ensure that all activities will only be implemented with ongoing concurrence
of the MOH, the DHO, the PMTCT Coordinator, the IE0 and HMlS Officers of the
District served.

0 Throughout the operational stages of the programme CHAI will collaborate with in
consultation with the above personnel to implement activities that can continue to be
managed when the project terminates.

o CHAI will avoid hiring personnel who cannot be sustained by the MOH.

o CHAI will ensure that the interventions involving community mobilisation and basic
infrastructure are effective enough to have long term impact, far beyond the
duration of the project.

0 CHAI will ensure that systems including M&E, patient flow and staff capabilities to
initiate ARV prophylaxis are firmly in place, and capable of duration beyond CHAI and
partners’ involvement

7. FUNDING REQUEST & BUDGET

To support this initiative, CHAI requests funding from the Government of the Kingdom of
Norway for comprehensive PMTCT support in the selected district of Machinga. The budget
is approximately $618 for each of 8,613 HlV+ mother-infant pairs in care, or $5.33 million
over three years (36 months) from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011.

Second District

If additional funds are available, CHAI proposes a subsequent phase of this proposal to
support successful implementation of the MOH PMTCT programme in a second district. This
phase would commence in the second year. Additional funds would be proportionate to the
number of mother-infant pairs or pregnancies in the district. Overhead costs would not
increase as a result of adding the second district.

Appendix 12: CHAI WORK I N MALAWI
INTRODUCTION:

The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI) came into Malawi in 2006 as part
of the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative (CHDI) with a mandate to drive rural
growth and business development in three districts designated by the Government of
Malawi. At the time, HIV/AIDS initiatives were pursued under direction of the
combined CHDI organization. Prior to this time, from 2004, Malawi was a beneficiary
of CHAl’s global work to reduce the cost of ARVs for developing countries.

People living in rural areas often lack access to basic health care. CHAI and its sister
organization in Malawi, the Clinton-Hunter Development Initiative (CHDI), have
teamed with Dr. Paul Farmer and his organization, Partners in Health (Pl H), in a rural
health initiative to provide HIV/Al DS care and comprehensive health care to people
living in the Neno District.

CHAI, CHDI, and PlH are working with the Government of Malawi to address the
complex needs involved in providing care in areas that lack even basic infrastructure.
This work includes: training health care workers; recruiting and training 84 new lab
assistants; enhancing lab infrastructure; providing test equipment, reagents, and
sample transportation; improving the physical capacity of health care facilities
including a new District Hospital in Neno; building health worker housing; providing
sanitation and water; and focusing on integrated rural development and growth,
education enhancement, and more. CHAI is also leading programmatic efforts in
treatment for severe acute malnutrition in Neno, has conducted all training in the
MOH CTC programme including for PlH clinicians, and continues to provide
supervision and RUTF for patient treatment.

CHAI began its programmatic work in Malawi in 2006 and currently its activities fall into
seven key areas:

1.
2.

27 May 2008 — Not For Distribution Outside Recipient’s Organization

Policy advice, support, and technical assistance to the Ministry of Health (MOH)

Procurement and distribution of ARV and diagnostics for paediatric care as
well as for Adult 2nd line therapy.

Paediatric nutrition services for the MOH’s Out-Patient Therapy Programme (OTP)
to treat children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) through Community-based
Therapeutic Care (CTC). CHAI has had extensive involvement in scaling up
Community-based Therapeutic Care (CTC) providing training and RUTF for the MOH’s
Outpatient Therapy Program (OTP) program.

Laboratory Services Programme to train Lab Assistants and to build, refurbish,
equip, supply and provide technical support for laboratories.

Paediatric programme development and support of paediatric HIV/AI DS outreach
and services, technical assistance with paediatric clinical trials, and support for the
MOH’s ART programme M&E.

Rural delivery of quality integrated health care services in partnership with
Partners In Health (PlH) in the Neno District.

PMTCT policy and programme development and support including Early lnfant
Diagnosis (El D).

CHAI Malawi helps train health workers in Community Therapeutic Care (CTC) that
focuses on finding children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). Funded by external
partners, CHAI also donates the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) essential for
treatment to care facilities throughout Malawi.
The programme is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality among children, especially
those with HIV/Al DS
CTC Program Support
0 3 Districts served directly by CHAI (Chitipa, Mwanza, and Neno)
0 Health Workers trained
I 636 Health Care Workers trained June - Dec 2007 by CHAI in Community
Therapeutic Care (CHAl’s involvement in CTC started in May 2007) for the
MOH’s Outpatient Therapy Program (OTP) for Severe Acute Malnutrition
(SAM) using RUTF.
- Another 178 trained in Jan and Feb 2008.
RUTF Procurement & Treatment
0 17 Districts supplied by CHAI (4 by Concern Worldwide); 6 Districts unserved.
o 135 metric tons of RUTF purchased since the start of the program
0 Over 10,000 children suffering from SAM have been treated using RUTF from
CHAI
Supplier support — operations assessment to reduce cost of RUTF, all of which is
purchased from Malawi suppliers
Challenges
0 Sustainability — Working with District Health Officers to have them incorporate a
portion of RUTF costs in their District Implementation Plans (DlPs or budgets).
This is a significant challenge, short-term.
0 Need for a stronger linkage and better M&E to show the mutual linkage between
nutrition and HIV/Al DS ART scale-up.

o CHAl’s influence in the paediatric area has involved increasing awareness and
importance of paediatric care, helping initiate an EID pilot, and promoting infant FDCs.
The impact of these efforts will felt over the long term.

- Fixed Dose Combination Paediatric ARVs (FDCs)

o No FDCs in MOH ART Guidelines. Limited use in Malawi

0 CHAl’s efforts resulted in a change in the 2008 ART Guidelines to include
paediatric FDCs with an emphasis on formulations for children weighing <10KG.
The guidelnes are expected to be printed and distributed in May or June 2008

o This should have important quality of care impacts.

0 Training will need to take place in the future for changed ART options. Impact
likely to be limited in 2008

- Disaggregated Outcomes Reporting Initiative

0 Just approved following a lengthy review by MOH, NAC, and GOM ethics
committee, CHAI has launched a “Disaggregated Outcomes Assessment Project”
that is taking place from April-Aug 2008 using digital imaging, data entry, and
analysis. This will establish a 2007 baseline and identify sentinel sites for annual
assessment that will provide more detail in future and should result in improved
measurement of outcomes of Malawi’s ART programme.

0 For the first time since inception of Malawi’s ART effort, the MOH will know
outcomes by age and gender as well as other critical information. They will also
have a backup record of all data from every ART site in the country resulting in a
significant improvement in data security and availability.

o CHAI is helping to support elements of the MOH’s E| D program. During the pilot
in the Central and Northern Regions, we helped design the program with the
MOH and other Care partners and we provided sample transport and all the DBS
kits and reagents. In the Southern region phased ro||out, we will be doing the
same for the whole region as well as funding the training in Neno District. EID is
a critical component of the Ministry’s work as summarized below.

I 30,000 cases of Mother-To-Child Transmission per Year

I Pilot site staff trained in EID — linked to and part of PMTCT program.
509 Health Workers Trained [partially funded by CHAI].

o In June 2007 MOH started a pilot in the Central and Northern
Regions at 15 sites

0 8 sites in the Southern Region are to be added, with the first two
to be added starting
17 March 2008

o CHAI is providing DBStest kits/bundles, consumables, and
reagents for the whole country for El D.

o CHAI supplied sample transport for the Northern and Central
Regions during the pilot. UNICEF is continuing this support. CHAI
will provide sample transport for the Southern Region phased
ro||out where for sites where other care partners are unable to do
so. We are also supplying the Neno District with training support
and all supplies for Neno District where PIH is implementing EID

0 Target for scale-up: 20,000 infants tested/year by unspecified time

0 Results to Date as reported by the MOH

0 3,801 tests done June 2007 — Jan 2008 including retests
0 2,801 initial tests
I 19% H|V+; 12% H|V+ from retests following initial
test (as a result of breastfeeding)
I 42% OF H|V+ referred to ART
I 58% received CTX

PMTCT

CHAI and other care partners have recently participated with the MOH in revising the PMTCT
guidelines. We have indicated our desire to provide assistance to implement the PMTCT
programme as outlined by the MOH guidelines. The Ministry is very supportive and hopes
CHAI can provide support in one or more districts to demonstrate that a highly successful,
sustained effort is possible. CHAI is preparing a proposal to support PMTCT as the MOH has
requested.

In addition, Partners In Health (PIH) is working with the MOH on a proposal for the Neno
District where they hope to pursue a PMTCT effort. In Neno, PIH is CHAI’s and CHDI’s
clinical implementation partner. Here, they support the DHO in delivering comprehensive
health care that includes significant community-based care using village health workers.
Once they have agreement with MOH on their programme, CHAI may seek financial support
to contribute to their efforts.

Appendix 14: CARE PARTNERS

At the request of the MOH CHAI has targeted for this project a focal area that is currently
almost without direct NGO presence. In order to scale up the national PMTCT programme
the GOM works closely with all implementing partners including CHAI. CHAI, together with
other care partners, has been actively involved in the PMTCT and Paediatric HIV Sub-Group
Committee, as well as the Technical Working Group. All of these partners played key roles
in assisting the MOH in developing and finalizing the 2008 PMTCT Guidelines. Since PMTCT
services in one district cannot be isolated from the services provided nationally CHAI will
collaborate, on various levels, with several of the following partners:
