Annex I Agreed Project Summary

Identification of the Project

Project Title/Name: Support to Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation
Project (MWI-07/010)

Implementing institution: Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust in
collaboration with the Department of Forestry

Description of the Project

Mulanje Mountain has diverse and rich ecosystem, which is home to a wide range of
organisms. It is also a catchment of headwaters and a source of many perennial rivers
and streams. However, the mountain resources are threatened by densely populated
communities which heavily depend on mountain’s natural resource base for a living.

In order to check the alarming rate of deforestation and loss of biodiversity on the
mountain the MMCT developed and submitted to the GEF a biodiversity project
Mulanje Mountain Biodiversity Conservation Project (MMBCP). The Project has ﬁve
major components; i) Trust Administration, ii) Biodiversity Conservation, Research and
Monitoring, iii) Environmental education, iv) Forest Co—management and Sustainable
Livelihoods, and v) Conservation Tmst Fund. The MMCT Fund was then established as
the ﬁnancing mechanism for the above mentioned Project components.

Goals and objectives
The government's main development objectives for the Mulanje massif, as for other
’key upland forest reserves in the country, is to maintain the vital watershed
(headwater for nine rivers) and to beneﬁt local communities by establishing
sustainable management of the natural resources vital to Malawi’s economic growth
and environmental protection through cooperation between the Forest Department,
local authorities and communities. Speciﬁc objectives of the MMCBP include:

— Maintain Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, including globally signiﬁcant biodiversity
and vital ecological services,

—— Increase awareness, understanding and appreciation of the value of the Mulanje
Mountain ecosystem, at local and national levels,

— Improve sustainability of biological resource use and enhance the value of the
MM ecosystem to local communities,

— Establish long-term income stream and institutional capacity to ensure
continuation of the above ﬁrst objectives,

— Demonstrate the appropriateness of Conservation Trust Fund as ﬁnancing
mechanism for biodiversity conservation.

Outputs
Progress toward this objective is being measured and monitored in terms of:

— increased awareness, understanding and appreciation of the importance of
environmental management in general, and of biodiversity conservation in
particular, particularly within FD and among local communities;

— reversal of the trend of degradation and loss of globally signiﬁcant biodiversity in
the Mulanje Mountain ecosystem, determined through ecological/biodiversity
monitoring program;

W re a

contribution to the implementation of the Reserve Management Plan, focusing on
the biodiversity conservation aspects;

a decrease in the incidence and levels of activities and events which represent
important threats to the area's biodiversity;

implementation of speciﬁc conservation actions (e.g., ﬁrebreak maintenance,
removal of invasive exotic vegetation), carried out to the extent possible by local
communities; ’

participation by local communities in co-management of the Forest Reserve, and
implementation and success of co-management pilot projects;

successful establishment and use of a Trust Fund to support conservation activities
over the long term, with effective participation of key stakeholders and a positive
reputation at Ideal, national and international levels; and

success in raising funds to increase the endowment and/or operational resources of
the MMCT.

Inputs

For the Project outputs to be fully achieved purpose equipment in form of vehicles,
computers, biodiversity assessment facilities (e.g. GPS) will be requireed. In addition
the Forestry Department and MMCT will require logistic support in form of
communication.

r Biodiversity conservation covers a wide range of organisms and topics and as such will
require a broad range of expertise. The Project will therefore rely on technical support
from other stakeholders such as the University of Malawi, National Herbarium and
Botanic Gardens of Malawi, The Museums of Malawi, and Forestry Research Institute
of Malawi.

The overall budget over a period of ﬁve years is estimated to be 49.5 MNOK. It is
expected that Norway will provide 25.5 MNOK and the rest will be provided by other
donors such as USAID. The Norwegian will be released in two phases, 5.5 MNOK to
ﬁnance the inception phase (2007-8 activities) and 20 MNOK to cover the
implementation period from 2008-12.

Main indicators

 

Global Objective:

1) Maintain Mulanje Mountain

3.0 Major risk factors (internal and external)

The primary risks to project achievement are inadequate cooperation from the Forestry
Department, the prevalence of corruption, and conﬂict with the mountain’s
neighbouring communities. An additional risk is the impact of the urban demand for
resources upon MMFR with the recent development of good quality access roads in the
area.

The proposed public private partnership management arrangement is being developed
chieﬂy to improve management of MMFR. The improvements being sought with this
stronger FD cooperation are a comprehensive planning and reporting system, efﬁcient
supervision of management interventions on the MMFR, management being effected by
professional and motivated staff, the application of effective law enforcement against
illegal activities, and the incorporation of more diverse resource management expertise.
The approach therefore will address most of the anticipated risks.

4.0 Overall tentative budget

The over budget over a period of ﬁve years is estimated to be approximately 49.46
MNOK (about US$ 8 244 068). It is envisaged that a contribution of NOK 25,500 000
provided over a period of ﬁve years for MMCT activities may result in reduced or zero
draw-downs. This will enable MMCT to reinvest all annual income from the
endowment. This in the end will enable MMCT to grow the capital to a level (currently
estimated to be US$ 8,346 668) that can generate the estimated ideal MMCT annual
budget of US$ 450 000. In this connection Norway will provide NOK 25 500 000
(representing 50% of the total budget) to ﬁnance MMCT activities for the period from
2007 to 2012. It is expected that the balance will be ﬁnanced through other sources such
as USAID, the EU etc. A summary of Norway’s contribution to the MMCT activities is
presented in the table below.
