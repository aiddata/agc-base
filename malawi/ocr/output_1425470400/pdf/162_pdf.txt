Background

Macadamia Long Term Benefits and Markets

Macadamia is a highly priced dessert nut and Malawi is the fifth largest producer
worldwide, with a successful track record in exports of the crop to some of the
highest value markets in the world: Japan and Europe. The commodity in its highest
value form is sold raw for export thus value addition occurs through high standards
in processing and grading. Commercial partners in Europe prefer to pack there in
order to better manage quality issues and deliver exactly what the market requires.

The processing factories in Malawi are export zones and therefore are not able to
add value to products in national markets, an opportunity which has been identified
for the smallholder industry. Smallholders are just entering the marketing chain with
a handful of regular suppliers, identifying FairTrade and potentially organic markets
as areas of value addition. A further area of value addition being explored is the
production of oils; however this will require large amounts of reject nut which due to
good production systems are not available. Further areas of value addition are being

1

 

 

explored by commercialising shell and husk products from supply chain bi-products.
The smallholders have developed markets for MS with hotels in the central region
which also adds value and promotes an alternative to shelled nuts.

Macadamia production in Malawi is at present estate dominated, but significant
plantings in the smallholder sector have already taken place and are continuing
across Malawi. The existing processing and marketing infrastructure will support
these smallholders to access markets and strengthen Malawi’s position as the 5th
largest macadamia producer globally. As production plateaus and then declines in
the largest origins (Hawaii, and appears likely in Australia too), Malawi will be well
placed to meet the steady increase in demand worldwide. The established
reputation for quality nut and export markets will place the Malawian macadamia
industry in a strong position to take these opportunities.

Macadamia has additional benefits. Macadamia is a resilient tree crop that is multi—
purpose with a nutritional kernel (edible nut), a hard shell that is energy dense good
for fuel, and a strong dense wood. It is suited to a relatively large area of Malawi in
cool areas at higher altitudes (above 1000m) which receive reliable rainfall in the
region of 1000mm.

Macadamia, as a tree integrated in smallholder production systems (particularly
small productive trees), can be intercropped and produce a cash crop, supplement
family nutrition and provide additional fuel wood, constituting a great support to
rural livelihoods in suitable locations.

Macadamia varieties for smallholders in Malawi

Existing Macadamia varieties in Malawi were selected in Australia and Hawaii.
Experience in Australia indicates the value of locally based selection from hybrids of
high performing varieties and varieties that suit the needs of different environments.

Tree size in Malawi is a major obstacle for increasing smallholder participation in the
macadamia industry because it makes inter—cropping more difficult and limits other
operations such as tree harvesting and insect management. The estates sector has
been very successful with macadamia and it now recognises the urgent need to find
locally adapted varieties that are small in stature while retaining the desired fruiting
and quality attributes. Developing varieties with reduced tree size by using a
dwarfing rootstock or inter-stock would be a great help to smallholder farmers and
the estate sector.

Australia has been seeking smaller tree size for many years and it is considered to be
a very important factor in new selections. As orchards age, they become less
efficient due to excessive tree size and a plateau in production. This is being
observed in maturing orchards on estates as a result, highlighting the need to reduce
tree size.

Through careful selection dwarfed trees with the desired yield and quality can be
selected, resulting in a better adapted tree to the conditions found in Malawi. In

The Development Process

In the early 1990’s a number of potential seedlings were selected at Bvumbwe
Agricultural Research Station (ARS) for evaluation. One of these has shown a
continued dwarfing habit under different environmental conditions in Australia and
has been returned to Malawi for further evaluation. The original establishment has
been lost in Malawi and the Bvumbwe ARS has minimal macadamia research
capacity available to this program at present.

The material selected was re-established in Malawi in 2006 at Satemwa tea & coffee
estate to make sure its field performance was comparable to that observed in
Australia. Prior to observation in Australia, the material was observed for many years
at Bvumbwe ARS as a grafted plant, later as cuttings in containers, and as a cutting in
the nursery in two different locations. Other material collected at the same time
subsequently proved to be not useable and was later destroyed. Consnderable effort

I

and time has already been expended to select the material being used in this
program. This work will initiate the next phase of a 16 year selection program.

The process of DNA-based identification of parents and characterisation is important
to understand genetic lineage. The source material for testing is created through
crossing pollen from high yielding reliable varieties already used in the Malawian
macadamia industry (5 varieties 660, 741, 816, 800 and 814 have been selected by
the industry) and the dwarfed material established at Satemwa. Initial genetic
analysis in Australia has identified the material as a likely genetic dwarf thus
confirming the value of the material and justifying the next stage of selection to
hybridise the dwarf with existing varieties. This work has been supported through
grants and in kind contributions from elsewhere (Neno Macadamia Trust €6000,
Australian Matching Grant €20,000). Within 6 months, it will be possible to identify a
hybrid with a dwarf parent by a simple leaf sample test in Australia at a small cost
through a relationship established by Dr Wayne Hancock with Southern Cross
University.

The next steps to this intervention are twofold, the first is to evaluate the use of the
material as a rootstock for existing varieties, in order to assess the potential for the
plant to be used as a dwarfing rootstock (Le. will reduce tree size of existing
varieties) or as an interstock for the same purpose. The second is to produce hybrids
using the dwarfing plant as one parent and the best existing varieties in Malawi as
the other. This will start the long process of developing new varieties that are
smaller and locally adapted for conditions in Malawi. Funding is needed to support
this process and to develop the linkages and partnerships needed for the evaluation
and use of the resulting varieties across the macadamia industry in Malawi.

lt is important to understand this is the start of the next phase of this work and will
form the platform and provide the data to enable the development of a longer term
program. Hence, further negotiation and development/progress is necessary in the
coming year with the industry and governmental institutions to ensure the potential
impacts of this material are fully explored and assessed.

Partnerships and Linkages

Until recently, this work was kept very low profile until there was sufficient evidence
for expansion of the work and the development of linkages and partnerships. This
was necessary to keep realistic expectations and to maintain control of the material.
This will continue to be necessary until strong and sustainable partnerships are
developed to support the field work going forward.

The implementation of this proposed intervention will be lead by Equal Exchange
Trading Ltd., a Scottish-based ethical trading company with 30 years experience of
supporting smallholder producers throughout the developing world to gain access to
European markets and obtain a fair price for their produce. Since 2007 Equal
Exchange has been working in Malawi towards developing a smallholder macadamia
supply chain, under the "Support to Smallholder Macadamia” project funded by the
Scottish Government. This project, which will phase out at the end of March 2011,

A

works in all 3 regions of Malawi supporting smallholder macadamia associations and
cooperatives develop the capacity and infrastructure required to attain their goal of
exporting macadamia. Given its long-term experience with macadamia smallholder
farmers in Malawi, and the relevance of the present proposal to the smallholder
sector, Equal Exchange was selected to be the lead partner of this intervention
developing new varieties of macadamia. As such, Equal Exchange in-country
management will coordinate the work developed at Satemwa Estate under this
project.

Satemwa Estate was selected as the implementation site because it is a tea and
coffee estate and, as such, it is independent of influence from the macadamia
industry and provided neutral ground to reintroduce material quietly. The
establishment would also be benefited by its isolation from other macadamia trees,
which means pollination material can be more easily controlled in early crosses. This
would enable the removal of pollen contamination from non selected varieties which
would occur where other varieties are established. The estate also had a suitable site
available, capacity to manage the trees and a team of horticulturalists capable of
undertaking grafting activities to build numbers. Hybridisation will be undertaken
under supervision of Dr Wayne Hancock in a field visit from Australia during

flowering phase. Eastern Produce has offered support in providing plots and
propagation if needed.

Satemwa is also ideally located in Thyolo between the macadamia production
centres at Bvumbwe and Thyolo. lts proximity to both macadamia as well as
agricultural research institutions will mean ease of distribution of material and
convenience of interactions such as meetings and trainings. The smallholder industry
is highly dispersed across 3 major production centres located in all three regions of
Malawi, which provides no logical centre for such work. However, the smallholder
industry has secure nursery sites which have potential for future trials.

The existing partnerships will need to be expanded to include the MOAFS-Research
Section. At this stage, Bvumbwe ARS is the most suitable place for research plots for
MOAFS as well as smallholder nursery sites at Ntchisi, Neno, and Ntchenachena
(Rumphi). At present the MOAFS has minimal supporting capability at Bvumbwe ARS
and this issue needs to be addressed if it is to provide support into the future.
Bvumbwe has suitable land. It is proposed to discuss this with Bvumbwe ARS and the
MOAFS in the coming year to make suitable arrangements.

The MOAFS has identified Misuku Hills and Viphia Plateau, but there are more
suitable and accessible sites where work in establishing the crop and smallholder
organisations are more advanced. The AWASp process includes macadamia and the
MOAFS is aware of the work undertaken by the Support to Smallholder Macadamia
Project in Neno, Ntchisi and Rumphi. However, the aim is to select material for
different regions in Malawi in the longer term, so existing and newer production
areas can be accommodated. Small tree size will greatly increase the ability to
establish in more areas.

The estate sector in Malawi has expressed interest in the development of locally
adapted varieties and has offered to support this endeavour. Estates have also
access to secure locations suitable for field trials and staff experienced with the crop.

Smallholders grow the crop at higher altitudes than the estates, and in a range of

agricultural systems, thus the participation of both smallholder and states provides
the program with a wide agro-ecological range.

A full list of partners their contact details and proposed role and responsibilities in
this intervention is included in Annex 2.

Funding requirements

In the short term, the need is to build up numbers of dwarf trees for field trials and
start the hybridization process. With appropriate amount of material a larger field
trial can commence at different locations representing the climatic range the crop is
grown under in Malawi. These sites will form the basis for a longer term varietal

selection program, enabling observation of material over a tree life cycle and under
different management regimes.

Funding for the next 12—18 months is required to propagate rootstocks, and inter-
stocks for field trials and; to undertake the production and testing of hybrids from

the dwarfing material. The plants produced by this work will be used for field
planting and assessment made of their performance.

Propagation is underway at Satemwa and needs resources to cover material costs
and staff time input. The hybridisation requires an expert to supervise crosses at
flowering and ensure good practice is followed. Follow up will be required once
hybrid seedlings are produced for DNA testing to ensure the dwarf is one parent and
the seedling is worth field planting. This will greatly reduce the space needed for
field trials and increase the efficiency of the selection work by eliminating non target

seedlings before they enter the field. The budget for this intervention is attached to
this document in Annex 1.

Management and supervision

Currently, the day to day management is undertaken by Satemwa staff, in particular
Mr Mark Gomani, the coffee manager at Satemwa. He has extensive experience in
macadamia as an estate manager and has supervised the work in the nursery so far

thus is familiar with the required techniques and has the ability to supervise nursery
operations.

This work will be further supported by Mr Nicholas Evans who will coordinate the
linkages to the smallholder industry. Nicholas Evans is the in-country manager for
Equal Exchange’s Support to Smallholder Macadamia project, and will provide the
bridge between the technical development of new varieties and their introduction
and adaptation to smallholder context.

 

Dr Wayne Hancock will provide the technical oversight required to ensure the
crosses are performed correctly and structured to enable full analysis of the hybrids.
Furthermore he will provide the linkages required to analyse the genetic make up of
the hybrids and support the selection of hybrids to take forward into field trial. This
work will be conducted during field visits to Malawi and at Southern Cross University

in Australia.

Financial management

The project finances will be managed by Equal Exchange’s in-country management,
using its Malawian bank account in Lilongwe. Mr Nicholas Evans is responsible for
this bank account and will supervise the correct use of funds. in‘iT'rs—absenee—imm
the project funds to be used for
the work to be carried out by Satemwa Estate and other stakeholders will be
transferred from Equal Exchange’s account in Malawi, following a schedule of
activities and plan for monitoring progress.

Reporting and M&E
This will be undertaken by Nicholas Evans and Dr Wayne Hancock in conjunction
with Mark Gomani and the Satemwa General Manager Mr Robert Emmott. In
addition to reporting every 6 months to irish Aid on progress, a series of technical
reports will need to be produced:
0 A methodology for work undertaken
0 Write up of initial findings to summarise the science bringing together field
work / observations with genetic analysis
0 Technical recommendations to inform the development of a wider varietal
trial utilising the material propagated in this project
0 institutional recommendations on how to undertake such a trial with the
smallholder and estate sectors in full collaboration with Malawi
Government Agricultural Research institutions

Timeframe

it is envisaged 12 to 18 months is required to complete the proposed work program.
The timeframe needs this flexibility because flowering and nut set patterns can vary
and the tree has a natural cycle that is not determined by our calendar year. The
additional time if required will not affect the proposed budget.
