The pilot Social Cash Transfer (SCT) programme began in 2006. By March 2010 the pilot programme
reaches over 28,000 households in seven districts. The programme is implemented by the Local Councils
guided by a secretariat in the Ministry of Gender, Children and Community Development (MoGCCD). Up
to now the programme has been financially supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
and Malaria with additional technical and financial support by UNICEF. The goal of this programme is to
improve the well—being of members of all ultra poor and labour constrained households and promote
investment in human capital in terms of nutrition, health, education, shelter, and through creation of
productive assets.

The target group of the programme are households that are ultra poor and at the same time labour
constrained. An estimated 300,000 households (10% of all households) fall into this category. These are
the neediest and most underprivileged households which consist primarily of elderly grandparents
caring for young orphans, households who are headed by persons with chronic illness or disability and
households containing children who live by themselves (child-headed households). These households
are unable to meet their most basic food requirements and often have limited or no access to existing
social and economic interventions in Malawi.

In 2007/8 the pilot programme was rigorously evaluated by Boston University and Malawi University
Centre for Social Research. The external evaluation concluded that SCT is feasible in the institutional
context of Malawi, that the implementation has been cost—effective and that the impact on household
level in terms of improved food security, nutrition, health and education is significant.

The purpose of this proposal is to request resources for an anticipated funding gap of 3 months
(October-December 2010). Currently, administration of the SCT programme is fully funded through the
Global Fund round 5 OVC grant through September 31, 2010. The German Government has pledged
support to the SCT programme in the amount of 13 million EURO for three years, starting in January
2011. Additionally, the Government of Malawi has tentatively committed USD 333,000, included in the
proposed budget for the upcoming 2010/11 fiscal year. For positive impacts to occur in beneficiary
households, consistent and reliable transfers of cash must be made to them each month. It is therefore
imperative that funding for this resource gap is secured.

To sustain current programme operations in 7 districts, USD 455,000 is needed per month for a total
resource gap of approximately USD 1.46 million. This calculation is based on the activity costs planned
by the District Assemblies in their yearly programme logframes, generated September 2009. This
estimate is costed based on the current estimate of programme coverage in the districts with the
exceptions of Mangochi, Chitipa and Phalombe who are conducting scale out exercises this year and
expanding coverage. As scale up activities are not currently planned for the proposed funding period,
activity 1 (targeting and approval of new beneficiary households) is not included in this budget. (Please
see lilirirlisa.=.ir .l for detailed activity budgetl)

 

1 All implementing districts participate in an annual workshop with technical advisors from MoGCCD and UNICEF to
update programme activity logframes and make subsequent budget adjustments. The attached budget was
generated using the most recent district logframes from September 2009, it is anticipated that logframes will be
updated again this year with only minor adjustments made to planned activities and subsequent costs.

Social Protection has bearings on the Malawi Constitution under Articles 30, 37, and 43. Therefore the
Government of Malawi has taken the responsibility to deliver meaningful social support seriously as
demonstrated by prioritisation in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) as its second
theme. Under theme two, protecting the vulnerable is a subetheme, with the long-term goal to improve

the life of the most vulnerable.

Cash transfers are non—contributory transfers of cash targeted to selected beneficiary households. Their
role is to provide social protection for households who are ultra poor and unable to establish a viable
livelihood due to being labour constrained. The Table 1_ Socia| cash Transfer Coverage 35 of
Malawi Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) March 2010
was designed to alleviate poverty, reduce “-Iv)-I,:,‘:....;“" 
malnutrition and improve school enrolment by
delivering regular and reliable cash transfers to
ultra poor households that are also labour
constrained.

TranSfer Programmes are also deSlgnEd to help llll‘llllllll‘lillillilltilililll lEEil
close the gap between the ultra poverty line and
beneficiary household (consumption) level. A
pilot programme was implemented in Mchinji
from 2006. A Cabinet directive in November 2006
endorsed the pilot in Mchinji and requested to
roll the pilot out to 6 additional districts by end of 2008. As of March 2010, SCTP is currently being
implemented in 7 districts in Malawi (Mchinji, Likoma, Machinga, Salima, Mangochi, Chitipa and
Phalombe) with Mchinji being the only district implementing at scale. The programme currently has over
98,000 beneficiaries in 24,500 households.

 

The targeted households are the most destitute in the country as they have a very limited asset base
and are not able to meet their basic needs. These households also have no labour base and therefore
are unable to earn productive income for expenditure on food, clothing, hygiene or education. Often
such households are unable to access other existing social protection interventions such as public works
(workfare) or agriculture input subsidy as they do not have the productive capacity to benefit from such
labour intensive programmes. Please see illririizsiii .22' for an illustration of the varying categories of poor in
Malawi and their subsequent social protection needs. The SCTP is able to increase household
expenditures of these vulnerable households through delivery of a regular monthly cash transfer
(impacts from an external evaluation are provided below). The programme will contribute to ultra
poverty alleviation combined with investment in economic growth and social development.

An external evaluation of the Social Cash Transfer Pilot in Mchinji was conducted by Boston University
and University of Malawi’s Centre for Social Research. The study followed a group of beneficiary
households and a group of control households for a period of one year (March 2007-March 2008). The
impact of SCT on various indicators within the households was measured through both a
baseline/follow—up comparison and comparison of before—and—after indicators in beneficiary households
to control households. Observed impact includeszz

Short term economic impact:

1. Beneficiary households are lifted above the ultra poverty line.
2. Increased access to credit for poor household who were previously left out.
3. Strengthening of local markets.

Economic Impact Report of the Mchinji Social Cash Transfer Pilot. Available at http://chii'dresearchpolicy.org.

 

4. An economic multiplier effect experienced in villages and surrounding areas where transfers are
received.

In the long term:

1. Improved health and education of the children in beneficiary households is an investment in
human capital and will contribute to sustained economic growth.

Social development has been advanced through:
1. Reduction in chronic malnutrition as household food security and diversity increases.
2. Increases in school enrolment, retention and performance.
3. Decreases in child labour.
4. Overall improved health of beneficiaries.

Given the positive impacts from the pilot programme, Government wishes to scale up the programme to
eventually cover all ultra poor and labour constrained households.3 Malawi is currently designing a
National Social Support Programme to reach social protection needs of all categories of the poor (please
see iiiririisiil' ii") in which SCTP will be a key component provide social protection to this vulnerable group.

a. Overall Goal/Impact:
To improve the well—being of members of all ultra poor and labour constrained households and promote

investment in human capital in terms of nutrition, food security, health, education, shelter, and through
creation of productive assets.

b. Project Purpose/ Outcome

To extend coverage of the Social Cash Transfer Programme to all ultra poor and labour constrained
households in all districts of Malawi as a key component of the National Social Support Programme.
SCTP will be one strategy to provide social support to the most vulnerable in an effort to ensure that the
household income/expenditure exceeds the national ultra poverty line and reduce inequality.

c. Objectives / Results
1. To lift 300,000 labour constrained households with a population of 1.3 million people out of
ultra poverty.
2. To contribute to the economic development of the country through an economic multiplier
effect.
3. To contribute to the social development of the country through investment in human capital
(i.e. health, nutrition, education of children in beneficiary households).

d. Output

Cash transfers have been shown to greatly increase the economic resilience of beneficiary households
and empower the beneficiary to address the needs that are most urgent to the household. Ultra poor
households who do not have labour are among the most vulnerable in Malawi as they are often unable
to meet even the most basic of needs. Providing cash transfers to these households is an effective and
efficient means of ensuring that intended resources do indeed reach the intended beneficiaries. Results
from an external evaluation show that beneficiaries use the resources on food, clothing, hygiene,
shelter, school costs and investment in assets. Additionally, cash transfers compliment other
interventions and programmes through increasing access to necessary services such as healthcare and

education. Through increasing expenditure ability, the most destitute households in Malawi are
empowered to meet the needs of its household members.

At household level, the expected outcomes are:

Improved food security.

Improved access to shelter and other non—food basic needs.

Economic shock resilience.

increased school enrolment, attendance, retention and performance of all children
including orphans and children with disabilities.

0 Improved health and nutrition of the target group of households.

Increased access to health services and improved health—seeking behaviours.

Mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS on beneficiary households.

Increased levels of employment and participation in community development activities.
Increased accumulation of household assets and reduced need for emergency aid.

Reduced levels of delinquencies and child abuse such as child labour, exploitation and early
marriages.

0 Reduced incidence of gender-based violence.

0 Reduced number of beggars.

o Decrease stigmatization and discrimination of beneficiaries.

On aggregate level, the expected outcomes are:

0 Reduced household ultra poverty from 10% to 5% by 2015.

0 Increased progress towards achieving the MDGs 1,2,3,4 and 8 by 2015.

0 Increased economic growth in the short term through improved access to credit,
strengthened local markets and increased labour demand in local community.

0 Increased long term economic growth by investment in human capital (health and education
of children).

0 Improved overall health status of the country.

Direct beneficiaries: All members of households who are ultra poor households and at the same time
labour constrained. A household is defined as labour constrained when it has no able bodied household
(HH) member in the age group 19—59 who is fit for work (households consisting exclusively of the elderly,
children, chronically ill, disabled persons) or when a HH member who is fit for work but has to care for
more than 3 dependents (dependency ratio of more than 3). Approximately 65 percent of current
beneficiaries are children, nearly 80 percent of whom are orphans. An estimated 18 percent of current
beneficiaries are elderly over the age of 65 (for current coverage, please see 'i‘"i::ihires? Ii). The total number
of beneficiary households at scale in 7 pilot districts is estimated to be approximately 83,000
households. At national scale an estimated 1.3 million beneficiaries would be reached including 871,000
children in 304,534 households.

Indirect beneficiaries: Members of the surrounding community are relieved from overwhelming social
"ll.i||".llnllmnl.  W \I , burdens as former ultra poor households now have a

Willi:

reliable income and adequate access to food.
Beneficiary households have been observed to share
some of the money (namely with needy relatives), give
loans and provide employment (through hiring of
casual labour) to other non-beneficiary households.
“WM . Additionally, local business owners and traders have

will experienced an increase in customers and therefore

~ ~ i business profits. This results in growth in the local
economy and strengthening of the local market. The Economic Impact Study found evidence that the

 

 

Social Cash Transfer Programme has multiple influences on economic development that is in line with
the Social Support Policy including:

Enabling the poor to protect themselves against shocks;

Increasing the productive capacity and asset base of poor and vulnerable households;
Encouraging investment by reducing risk through the predictability of transfers;
Unlocking economic potential; and

Stimulating demand for local goods and services and supporting enterprises in rural
areas.4

3. Impact on other Government projects and activities In addition to income support, target group
households require access to a number of social and economic services like basic health, nutrition,
sanitation, education and agricultural extension. Some require home—based care, HIV and AIDS services,
rehabilitation services and/or psycho-social support. Many of the beneficiary households may have

ill

experienced limited or restricted access to these
services given their monetary status prior to SCT
Programme. It has been observed that utilization of
such services greatly increases after cash transfers “) 
when beneficiaries have money to access. The District l H  W
Social Support Committee (on district level) and the UH)” ‘ ii i, l I

providers.

b. Impact on business sector
A recent economic impact evaluation of the Mchinji SCT Programme was recently released
demonstrating positive impacts on local markets and businesses. it was found that SCT beneficiary
households spend their cash at local markets thereby increasing revenue for local business owners and
' traders. Additionally, beneficiaries are given increased
access to credit as business owners report lending to
‘ SCT households with the confidence that credit will be
h. . M: ' repaid. Business owners also confirmed that “the SCT
y. , i ,. ‘ has strengthened the local market by providing a steady
, r l 1 source of customers and cash into villages where they
‘  l l ‘ had once been scarce.” The SCTS has also had an impact
WW 1 I ‘ ‘ M on the demand for labour as beneficiary households
W) ‘ ‘ I ‘ now have cash to hire more casual labour outside of the
"1" household.

 

 

C. Impact on the community (Poverty and Social Impact)

Results from the external evaluation of the SCTS (March 2007-March 2008)5 illustrate the significant
positive impacts in intervention households compared to the control households including:

targeting in a multi—stage participatory process to identify beneficiaries. Gender balanced Community
Social Support Committees (CSSCs) are elected by the community at village group level. These

0 Ultra poor: A household is ultra poor if it is in the lowest expenditure quintile and under the
ultra poverty line (only one meal per day, not able to purchase essential non-food items like
soap, clothing, school material, are begging, and have no valuable assets)

0 Labour constrained: A household is considered labour constrained when it has no able bodied
adult fit for work or a dependency ratio of more than 3. These households are not able to
access or benefit sufficiently from labour based interventions like public works or ganyu (piece
work). These criteria are defined below:

0 High dependency ratio: The household head between the ages of 19-59 who may or
may not be fit for work, but must care for more than 3 dependants.
o A person who is not fit for work includes:
1. A child who is under the age of 18,
2. A person who is elderly (above the age of 60 years old),
3. A person who is between the ages of 19—59, but is chronically ill or disabled, or
4. A school going person, up to the age of 25.

Each interviewed household is then visited by a district level line Ministry extension worker to verify that
information given is accurate. The committees then rank all interviewed households according to
neediness and present this list to a second community meeting to ensure that households meeting the
criteria are not left out, those that are ineligible are removed and that there is community consensus on
the ranking. The District Social Support Committee at the district assembly level then verifies the
fairness, transparency and correctness of the targeting process and approves all eligible households up
to a level of 10% of all households living in the respective village group. This cut—off was defined based
on results of the Malawi Integrated Household Survey which approximates that 10% of the population
of Malawi fit the targeting criteria of ultra poor and labour constrained.

In line with the decentralization policy in Malawi, the programme is managed by Local Councils who
receive assistance, guidance and supervision from National level (please see rflrziimzz:=',i:' ii). The Ministry of
Development Planning and Cooperation provides leadership and coordination of technical assistance to
the design and implementation of SCT Programme. The Ministry of Gender, Children and Community
Development houses the National Social Cash Transfer Management Unit which provides support to and
oversees the District level implementation of the programme.

On district level, the programme is implemented by Secretariats which are supervised by District

("Amminni A n A u n 5...} (‘AALJ r..._._-_‘_ rec‘d, A .-

 

a Coordinator and a number of Social Welfare Assistants. They receive assistance from officers of
various line Ministry departments in the Assembly as well as NGOs and civil society. This multi—sectoral
Social Support Committee (SSC) act as trainers of the Community Social Support Committees (CSSC). The
Secretariats also closely cooperate with the District Finance Departments which are responsible for the
delivery of transfers.

At the Community level, under the AEC, a CSSC is nominated and is trained to conduct the targeting of
potential beneficiary households. Upon approval, the CSSC provides follow—up and communication to
SCTS beneficiaries. Extension workers and civil society provide support and verification on eligibility of
beneficiary households. They also provide backstopping support to the CSSC in terms of communication
and referral of beneficiaries to additional social, economic and health interventions in the area.

The national SCT Management Unit is hosted in the Ministry of Gender, Children and Community
Development. The overall objective of this management body is to ensure effective implementation of
the social cash transfer programme at national and district level and to enhance coordination of the
various tasks required among the key line ministries and other partners involved. The Unit is hosted
under the Department for Child Development with ultimate supervision from the Principal Secretary
(please see 1121'l"'l‘l"l‘if§3‘.Jl' all).

Three main committees will report to the PS through the Director for Child Development Affairs. The
Director is responsible for the day-to-day management and oversight of the programme and he/she will
oversee the work conducted in primary areas. The three Committees are led by committee coordinators
who oversee and draw upon a team with membership from various ministries:

1. Committee on Management is composed of representation from MoGCCD, MoDPC, Local
Government, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities. Within the team, officers are assigned to specific
SCT districts. These officers provide effective support to their districts, M&E and day to day
management. Their primary tasks include:

0 Establish the programme in 6 additional districts per year

0 Train and retrain district level officers

0 Coordinate the annual logframe and budget planning of all districts

0 Monitor programme inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes and take corrective action in
case of plan deviations

0 Provide guidance, close supervision and effective assistance to implementing districts

2. Committee on Financing draws membership from MoF, MoLGRD, Local Government Finance
Committee, Accountant General and MoGCCD and key development partners. Their main roles
include:

0 Develop financial tracking instruments to manage funding flows at every level from donor to
district council to ensure that no gaps occur

0 Audit financial transactions, ensuring financial prudence and efficiency

0 Assist District teams to develop funding requests, report liquidation, and financial
management

3. Committee on Advocacy is composed of representation from MoGCCD, MoDPC, MoF, MoLGRD,
MoEPwD, MolCE, development partners and civil society. They are responsible for:

0 Ensure an effective flow of information between all stakeholders, especially between
national level units and the districts

0 Document and report programme progress, inform stakeholders on all relevant issues and
advise policy makers when policy decisions are required

The Management Unit will convene monthly workplan meetings with key partners during which each
Committee present an update of their various tasks and implementation issues. Quarterly Director
meetings will be called to engage in policy discussion and decision.

An internal monitoring system is in place to monitor progress towards achievement of the SCT
programme objectives. Monthly monitoring is conducted by the district SSC in collaboration with the
district M&E coordination committee members under the guidance of the district M&E officer. A
continuous monthly monitoring report (MMR) is compiled. The report focuses on monitoring of
implementation issues including activities and outputs and is financed out of the SCT budget.

The compiled report is forwarded through the Councillor to the National Management Unit who
compiles comments into a summary that is presented to the SSTC. It is also the responsibility of the
National Management Unit to provide feedback to each District Assembly within a reasonable time
frame. The district level monitoring also includes Rapid Appraisal Surveys (RAS) which focus on specific
issues of quality of targeting, impact of transfers on school enrolment and attendance, and assessing
beneficiary use of cash transfers. The RAS is not included in the SCT budget but financed through a
formal request/proposal made by the district.

Additionally quarterly monitoring is undertaken by national level M&E team, with coordination from the
National Management Unit (MoGCCD). The monitoring visit includes verification of the information
included in district MMRs as an auditing exercise. it is envisaged that each implementing district will be
visited once each quarter and follow up visits are made as necessary. Reports are generated by each
visit and follow up undertaken where necessary. District stakeholders also compile reports on quarterly
summaries that highlight programme progress, achievements, challenges and actions. Additionally, each
quarter a meeting is called to join national and district level stakeholders together to discuss progresses,
challenges, achievements and to solidify follow up support from National level.

As a donor to the programme, Irish Aid may be invited at any time to participate in programme
monitoring trips and district level distributions, in agreement and through arrangement made by
MoGCCD.

The programme will also be externally evaluated to examine medium-term impacts and achievement of
programme objectives. An evaluation has been proposed to begin January 2011 to serve as a 4 year
follow up of the initial impact evaluation and will be the first medium term impact evaluation of a cash
transfer programme of its kind.

During this pilot phase, the programme is funded by the GFATM and funds are channelled through the
National Aids Commission (NAC). The district level submits financial requests directly to NAC for
implementation of activities. The funds are then transferred to District level operating accounts from a
national holding account at the Reserve Bank of Malawi. Upon completion of activities, districts submit a
liquidation report to NAC prior to next request and subsequent release of additional funds.

In future, funds will be contributed from multiple sources. These funds have to be managed in an
efficient and transparent way. An appropriate funding mechanism for the scaled up programme is
proposed to be the newly established Local Development Fund (LDF). The LDF is a standardized,
transparent financing mechanism which channels funds to local governments. It has been put in place
with the aim of decreasing transactional costs and harmonizing the flow of financing for local councils
(LCs). Reporting on the funds channelled through the LDF financing mechanism is done from the District
Council to the National Local Government Finance Committee and with ultimate oversight of
expenditures by the Steering Committee, hosted by the Secretary to the Treasury.

Until the LDF is fully operational, an interim measure has been proposed that allows donors to channel
funds directly to SCT activities in districts. The agreed upon arrangement involves utilization of the

 

United Nations’ Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer (HACT) system and direct earmarking funds to
Districts directly. The HACT approach involves conducting an in—depth micro—assessment of capacity and
risk of various implementing partners and subsequent support to improve risk status and manage funds.
All SCT districts have undergone this assessment and have been cleared for resource transfers from
UNICEF. An audit of all SCT implementing districts is planned for completion by year end of 2010, with
the next round of micro—assessment to begin 2011. Until complete integration of the LDF, funding for
SCT activities will be channelled through the UNICEF Malawi country office and follow the financial
liquidation and reporting protocol of HACT. {Please see iiiririizzzui .Ii' for diagram of proposed funding
mechanism)

The simplified HACT financial risk management system will demonstrate a dramatic improvement in
reliable and predictable movement of resources from national level to district and communities. The
UNICEF system will disburse funds on a quarterly basis and will follow the Financial Authorization and
Certification of Expenditure (FACE) modalities that all current SCT District Assemblies are already very
familiar with. The UNICEF Finance Unit will provide backstopping and monitoring of resources disbursed
to districts. As custodian of Irish Funds for SCT UNICEF will re ort to the Committee on Financing in the

Given the nature of the SCT Programme and the derivation of resources from multiple sources,
reporting will follow one joint mechanism that is in line with current SCT M&E framework. Programme
activities, outputs and results will be provided to MoGCCD each month through the Monthly Monitoring

Report as outlined in the M&E framework. A summary report will be synthesized at National level and
forwarded on to all stakeholders bi—annually.

As described above, financial reporting will follow UNICEF HACT requirements until the LDF is
operational and integrated into the programme. Current UNICEF protocol will be followed and a
financial report will be synthesized from District financial reports and provided to donors on a quarterly
basis. Given the capacity developing nature of the HACT approach, the districts will be consistently
reviewed and supported to ensure full accountability of all donor funds channelled through UNICEF.

A final detailed donor report will be completed through collaboration between MoGCCD and UNICEF in
which all activities and financial expenditures will be described and accounted for. It is proposed that
this report will be completed within two months of the final liquidation of donor funds.

 

Ell. u site i n IEI b iii i'lzzy

Since 2006, the country has made significant progress towards its social protection agenda with the
development of a social protection policy framework. Social Protection is the second theme under
Malawi’s Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) which is the successor to the Poverty Reduction
Strategy. The MGDS recognises the need to invest in social development through education, health,
good governance and the need to protect the most vulnerable. As noted above, a Social Protection
Steering Committee and a Technical Committee have been put in place and the Ministry of
Development Planning and Cooperation serves as the Secretariat.

The Government of Malawi collaborated with partners (UN agencies, donors, bilateral and international
agencies) and civil society to develop a Social Support Policy.6 The policy was developed as an
instrument to provide a "holistic framework for designing, implementing, coordinating, monitoring and
evaluating social support interventions.”7 These interventions aim to protect, promote and transform
the livelihoods and welfare of the poorest and most destitute households. The Policy was submitted to
Cabinet in June 2010 with anticipation that it will pass and subsequent design of a comprehensive
National Social Support Programme will commence.

In November 2006, after a successful commencing of the Social Cash Transfer Scheme in Mchinji District,
Cabinet took a decision to roll the pilot out to 6 additional districts (Likoma, Salima, Machinga,
Mangochi, Chitipa and Phalombe). It is anticipated that the SCT Programme will feature as a key
component of welfare support in the National Social Support Programme. Government has pledged
strong commitment to scale the programme out to the rest of the country through a budgetary
allocation of USD 330,000 for fiscal year 2010/11 and a statement made by President Bingu wa
Mutharika during his opening statement of the 2010 Budget Session in Parliament.

fiestaunrlze ttliisieirlls fur SEEIIIIIILIII

Administration of the SCT programme at current levels is fully funded until October 2010 with financing
from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). Government is expected to
provide USD 333,000 in fiscal year 2010/2011 with potential to continue yearly fund allocations for this
programme in the coming years. The German Government has pledged support in the amount of EURO
13 million from 2011 and UNICEF will continue support of USD 2.5 million per year towards SCTS. These
contributions will help maintain the anticipated (October 2010) administration of the programme in 7
districts covering an estimated 29,000 households.

There is a need of USD 1.4 million to cover the gap in resources between October 2010, when the GF
grant ends and January 2011, when the resources from the German Government is expected to come in
country. This amount will allow the programme to continue being implemented at current levels of
coverage with the exception of Mangochi, Chitipa and Phalombe who are currently scaling up. (Please
see iiinudism Ll for detailed mon th/y activity budgetg)

Stakeholders are currently working to align the SCT Programme with the financing modalities of the
Local Development Fund. This will help facilitate consistent funding flows down to district implementers
while also ensuring that resources intended for the community actually reach the community.
Additionally this set up will allow for both development partners and Government to contribute funding

 

6 Government officially refers to Social Protection as Social Support and the two terms are used interchangeably
dependent upon venue of discussion.

7 Republic of Malawi, National Social Support Policy, August 2009.

8 All implementing districts participate in an annual workshop with technical advisors from MoGCCD and UNICEF to
update programme activity logframes and make subsequent budget adjustments. The attached budget was
generated using the most recent district Ioeframes from September 2009. it is anticipated that lngframeq will hp

 

to the SCTP through the pooled mechanism. As the LDF is based around District Development
P|an/Annual Investment Plan activities, funding will be consistent with Local Council planning, thereby
ensuring sustainable resources for implementation activities. While the LDF is in the process of
becoming operationalised, an arrangement has been made to channel German resources through
UNICEF based on its Harmonised Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT) modality. UNICEF proposes to Irish
Aid that the same mechanism to be used to channel resources directly to implementing districts during
the anticipated funding period. (please see FACE modality details in the Financial Management and
Accountability Section)

Iliilizsiizzll tiisu re all: IZZlIiI;'I:l"'Ir:II: II..i::Iviiael IIIIIIIsll-i;

Each implementing district has undergone a micro assessment by external HACT micro—assessment
consultants and received a HACT risk rating. While some district risk ratings were significant, they have
since been reviewed by UNICEF and have shown great improvements in the management systems in
question. As such, the UN Resident Coordinator (UNRC) has authorised all SCT implementing districts to
upgrade their cash transfer modality from the UN to receive direct cash transfer and their risk ratings
were lowered to moderate risk. This risk is further minimised through the extensive monitoring and
auditing systems put in place by UN to ensure that all activities/outputs are reported and all financial
expenditures are liquidated and accounted for. UNICEF operations officers travel out to all
Implementing Partners (including District Assemblies) and conduct financial spot checks to ensure that
all expenditure requirements are consistently met. UNICEF and MoGCCD will continue to conduct
reviews of these districts and audits have been planned for end of 2010 with anticipation of re-
assessments starting in 2011.

Past issues between NAC and the Districts have resulted in delay of resources reaching the SCT
beneficiaries, this has been due to the following observations made by UNICEF (a case example of
Mchinji is provided in the box below). First, complex multi—stage reporting following NAC requirements
has often proven to be laborious and time consuming for District level officers. Complaints that we have
received include complex financial reporting and liquidation that requires time and input from multiple
sectors in the District including officers in Social Welfare, Monitoring and Evaluation and the Director of
Finance.

Additionally, NAC desk officers have a history of a high turnover rate. These are the officers that are
assigned to provide direct support to Districts and ensure that NAC reporting requirements are met.
When a position is vacated, it has been noted that some are not replaced for months, thereby
generating a break in communication and processing of liquidation reports/ resource requests.

Finally, communication is weak between NAC, National Secretariat at MoGCCD and District level officers.
It has been documented that a District may submit a report and receive little or no feedback on it for
weeks at a time. UNICEF has been working with MoGCCD to strengthen the National Secretariat in
programme monitoring and follow up of bottlenecks. This has involved secondment of an M&E officer
from Ministry of Development Planning and Cooperation directly to the National Secretariat to build
human resource capacity in this area. Capacity development at this level continues to take priority as

one UNICEF's key roles to compensate for high turnover rates which are often encountered in the
Ministry.

In the past, UNICEF has worked    Vlevel  avoid 
such complications. UNICEF has provided financial and technical support through development of a
financial tracking instrument and supporting annual workshops with MoGCCD, District Assemblies and
NAC in which detailed activity Iogframes and annual SCT budgets are collaboratively developed for each
district. During these sessions, NAC has been invited to conduct training sessions for district officers on
reporting requirements and protocols.

As indicated previously, the Irish Aid funding will go through UNICEF systems and so will not face the
same challenges as experienced with NAC funding. The aforementioned complex financial tracking and
reporting procedures will be simplified through the UNICEF financial management system and National
level capacity will continue to be strengthened.
