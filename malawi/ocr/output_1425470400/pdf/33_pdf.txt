MAJOR CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN

The main change in the programme activity was the upgrading of the electricity
capacity in the College of Medicine. Part of the funds that were allocated for
equipment was used to upgrade the capacity of electricity as well as buying of a
Generator to service the College. This activity was very critical to the college in
order to cope with the increased-demand in electricity capacity as well as
mitigate the power problems in Malawi.

ASSESSMENT _
The college of medicine has grown tremendously during the project period.
Notable achievements: include



increase of student intake to 60 in 2002

introduction of Premedical programme in 2003

introduction of Masters of Public Health in 2003

Development of the College strategic plan towards 2020 
Development of the Muiti-disciplinarv research proiect involving the whpie

EFFICIENCY OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES

Students and staff access to computers has improved tremendously with
the increase in number of computers in the computer laboratory and
departments. The installation of the wide area network with unlimited
internet access has enriched the teaching and research environment of
the College. Several computer training programmes have been
conducted and use of both the internet and intranet enhanced.

Community health teaching in the last year went very well with minimal
problems due to the increased access to and reliability of transport.

Student access to up-to-date books and journals was enhanced with the
procurement of new books and renewal of periodicals subscriptions. The
new Library at Mahatma Ghandi campus iS now operational hence
reducing problems of commuting to Polytechnic Library.

The College of Medicine participated in two activities in the year in
collaboration with the University of Oslo which was a result of the two trips
that were undertaken by the two delegations that went to NonNay. The
activities were:

attendance by Messrs H Misili and B Kumwenda of the Health
Informatics Module

Participation by Professor R Broadhead and Professor E Zijlstra at
the University’s Summer School.

In collaboration with the University of Oslo, a module in Health Informatics
ywill be introduced which will form part of the proposed Masters of Public
m

The number of Malawian trained teachers has increased tremendously
from 5 : 1 to 3:1. This has enriched the colleges teaching and research
capacity.

CHALLENGES

There were few challenges met during the implementation of the project that
were not foreseen at the onset of the Project. Notable one is the to work within
the timeframe of the project in relation to the scholarships for members of staff.
The Calendar for the project and the training of staff members did not match
hence making implementation to exceed the recommended time.

CONCLUSION

The Ministry of Health and Population through the College of Medicine has
benefited a lot in the initial period of the NORAD Project. It is expected that
these benefits will continue to accrue in the next period and in future years to
come.

The projects tallies very well with the College’s Strategic Plan “Towards 2020”
and the Governments Essential Health Care Package and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper.
