provision of high qualiTy affordable seed. The oquuTs from This projecT will conTribuTe
To The regional program of COME-SA TACTESA) ThaT is Targefing The increased
producTion in seven landlocked counTries in The region

The projecf conTinues To focus on iTs Three primary objecTiyes:

2. improve The policy environmenT for seed Trade
3. STrengThen The commercial disTribuTion neTworl; for improved see
complemenTary inpuTs, and resulTing crop loquuTs.
In order To conTinue wiTh The implemenTaTion of The Three primary abjecfives, ICRISAT
is requesTing fora granT of €500,000.

High qualiTy seed is The basis for increased smallholder farmer yields and incomes,
and Through The projecf, The firsf Two years have been evidenced by increased
demand for high qualiTy cerTified seeds. This has parficularly been influenced by The
Farm lnpuT Subsidy Program [FISP), whicl“ is being implen‘reniea by The ivlalawi
Governmenf. Since indicaTions are There ThaT The Fla? is likely To conTlnue for The nexT
Three years, and imporTanle acT as an invaluable promoTional Tool in The process of
improving The adopTion raTe of cerTified seeds, The projecf will, during The Third year
of implemenTaTion, confinue supporTing GovernmenT‘s eiforTs by increasing The
producTion of Breeder, Basic and CerTified seeds. Key crops To be TargeTed will
include groundnuis, pigeon peas, chickpeas, beans and rice

While lCRlSAT will direchy produce breeder seed parTicularly Tor iTs mandaTe legume
crops such as groundnuTs, pigeon peas and chickpeas, a seleoied number of
growers will be conTracTed To produce Basic seed. This will be an inpuT inTo The
producTion of cerTified seed — an exercise Thaf will involve local seed companies,
farmers” associaTions and enTrepreneurs. Seed producTion will, Therefore, be
expanded and The projecT envisages a ToTal producTion of 30 meTric Tons breeder
seeds, 250 meTric Tons Basic seeds and approximaiely TOOO meTric Tons of cerTified
seeds during ifs Third year ldeTails of which are presenTed in The logaframe specifying

The Seed Trade Associafion of Malawi (STAM) has been insirurnehial in supporTing
The efforfs of The projecT by conducTing awareness campaigns on The imporiance
of using cerTified seeds by smallholder farmers. Besides, iT has been an imporTanT

program during The TirsT year of projecT implemeanTlon HEDGE/2009"). This volume is
expecTed To increase To a minimum of 500 meTric: Tons during The second yeor
(2009/20i0), Since The subsidy program TargeTs only smalll'iolder formers who connoT
afford To buy The required form lnpuTs, The seed made available Through This
program benefiTTed abouT l20,000 smollholder Tarmers wi'lh cerTiTied legume seec
supplied by ICRISAT.

Besides cenTering iTs efforTs on legume seeds, The ProjecT has also been TaciliTaTing
The producTion and morkeTing of high qualiTy seeds of oTher farmer-demanded
crops. For example, The producTion of cerTiTied rice seed by smdllholder farmers of
Wovwe and Hard WaTer Users AssociaTions ond Cnipamild in Korongo DisTricT hos
received acclaim by The NASFAM farmers who were provided wiTh cerTified seed in
The 2009—20l0 rainy season. Some cerTiTied rice seed produced by The Three groups
menTioned above have been sold To NASFAM members To produce grain rice for
consumpTion. Preliminary evidence by NASFAM members in Tiaronga has shown ThaT
farmers were able To double Their yields from on average of Home per hecTare To
approximaTely beTween 2.5 To 3 Tons per hecTare. This is a clear demonsTroTion Thar
The seed producTion sysTem esTablished by lCRlSAT is “crop—neuTral” and a very
eTTicienT sysTem Tor The delivery of seed Technology To smallholder farmers aT
affordable prices. Such enhonced yields for crops oTher Thon legumes also
guoronTees household food securiTy and increased rurdl incomes obTained by The
sell of surplus produce.

Basing on The reasons above for TargeTing legumes ond oTher demand driven crops
such as rice, TT is 0 clear manifesTaTion ThaT The ICRISAT implemenTed Malawi Seed

a) ldenﬁficafion of agro-deolers inieres’red To mounl demonsfralions on cer’rifieci
seed producTion; faciliToTe The developmenl and s’rrengihening of The cerﬁﬁed
seed disTribuTion network:

Agra—dealers have a very imporTanT role To play as They are r'nosle |ocaTed in
rural areas providing easy access To farmvinpuTs by smallholder farmers and
This helps farmers To minimize on TransporTaTion cosTs. Besides, ogre-dealers
remain as flexible in breaking The bulk info c::onvenienT pack sizes Thai can be
afforded by The rural smallholder farmers. Agra—dealers are also a source of
informaiion for boTh inpuT and oquuT markeiing and help sn’iallholder farmers
To quickly adapT To new agricuiTural Technologies.

To ensure Thai smallholder farmers appreciaTe The impedance of using high
qualiTy cerTified seed, agro—deaiers will be engaged To seT up demonsiraiiori
ploTs wiThin Their respecTive areas. Field days will be conducTed on
demonsTraTion ploTs mounTed by agro~dealers w inviTing smallholder farmers
from around Their areas.

lCRlSAT will TurTher TaciliTaTe The developmenT and sTrenng‘rening of a viable

The seed disTribuTion will be enhanced by increasing The number oT Agra—dealers
ThaT are members of AISAM or RUMARK organizaTions; The seed rnarlzeTing channel
members will also include big commercial organiza‘rions such as Arglr'iculTure Trading

They will access seed from ouTleTs locaTed closer To Their areas, This will in Turn help
farmers To save on TransporTaTion cosTs and seed cualiTy ThaT can cleTerioraTe when
delicaTe seed such as ThaT oT groundnui is noT properly handled and TransporTed
over long disTances.

The Malawi Seed Alliance (MASA) ThaT has recenle been launcl’red [esTablished
under The projech will work To ensure ThaT all seed auaIiTy sTandards in producTian
and markeTing areas are adhered To. The alliance will work closely wiTh The SSU and

any MASA member involved in seed Trade will be free To use The l‘vl/-\SA brand as

A MASA TrusT will be creaTed and iT will be Through The TrusT ThaT The MASA brand will

brand conTinues To be a symbol of high ciuoliTy seed and Thai ii is proTecTed Tram
imiTaTions by unscrupulous Traders poised To sell counTerTeiT producTs. The TrusT will
also be a very valuable Tool in cerTiTied legume seed producTion and markeTing as iT
will ensure ThaT There is cohesion of all MASA members collecTively organized around
an imporTanT goal of helping smallholder farmers increase Their yields and incomes
Through The compeTiTive and reliable provision oT high dualiTy anordable seeds. This
goes beyond The ProjecT’s lifespan hence The TrusT will help To ensure ThaT The
ToundaTion seT by The projecT will conTinue To be developed,

While more ToundaTion and cerTiTied legume and cereal seeds will be produced, The
success of The projecT and The seed indusTry beyond The projecT‘s life span will
depend on The effecTiveness of seed and produce morkeTing. In essence, sales of
cerTified legume seeds will be influenced by The availabiliry of reliable morkeTs Tor
legume produce. Currenle, The Farm lnpuTs Subsidy program is The major markeT Tor
legume seed. The ProjecT will Therefore work wiTh The lleSA TrusT To idenTiTy
addiTional markeTs for The cerTiTied legume seed. Linkages wilt also be done wiTh

ICRISAT, where necessary, To make necessary changes Ta The |:::>ra_iecT Ta suiT The real
farmers‘ requiremenTs in rural areas.

9.4 Risk Analysis/Mitigaﬁon
The major risk in seed producTion is rainfaii yariabiliTy which can affecT boTh The
quanTiTy and qualiTy of seed produced. One way of miTigaTing The efTecTs of rainfall
variabiliTy is To use improved high—auaiiTy seed and recommended agronomic
pracTices ThaT include early pianTing, Timely weeding and The rise of TerTilizers whicT
increases waTer—use efficiency.

OTher imporTanT risks are The unavailabiliTy of a profiTable grain markeT, and The ISP.
For smallholder farmers To confidenle increase hecTarage for 1;;ll"illiiiﬂ producTion using
cerTified seed, They have To be assured of The availabiliTy of markeTs for any auanTiTy
produced in excess of Their normal domesTic requiremenT for COHEUT’TWDTTOH.
UnavailabiliTy of reliable markeTs would make smallholder farmers To geT
discouraged and decide To use limiTed amounTs of cerTified seeds. This would credTe
negaTive effecTs on The overall sales of cerTified seed hence reTard The eTforTs by
MASA members To engage in high volume producTion and mari=:.eTing of cerTified
seeds.

The inpuTs subsidy program has seTTlea‘ in The minds of SI'TICTTH'TCTICTETT' farmers and acTs
as a promoTional Tool for smallholder farmers To swiTch from using i'ion'ie saved
recycled seed To using high qualiTy cerTiTied seed. This has parTicLJIarly been noTed in
legume seeds of which mosT smallholder farmers across The counTry believe TT is noT
necessary To buy cerTified legume seed when They can simply use seed saved from
Their previous producTion. The inpuT subsidy program has, in sucn cases, helped To
pull smallholder farmers of such aTTiTudes inTa accessing cerTiTied legume seed by
using The governmenT's disTribuTed coupons. Any abrupT change in policy by The
Malawi GovernmenT To sTop implemenTing The inpuTs subsidy program would
Therefore have an impacT on The adopTion raTe of cerTified legume seed.

Appraisal Note for 2010/11 ICRISAT Proposal

1.0

Introduction

ICRISAT submitted a 2010/11 proposal to implement a year 3 of the Ivlalawi Seed
Industry Development project. The goal of the project is to increase the smalll‘iolder
farmers’ yields and incomes through competitive and reliable provision of high
quality affordable seeds. The specific objectives of the project are:

To develop capacity of existing and potential local seed companies

To improve the policy environment for seed trade

To strengthen the commercial distribution network for improved seeds,
complementary inputs, and resulting crop outputs

In the previous year, the project has strived to strengthen the private sector
participation in the seed sector. The key achievements from year 2. are as follows:

10.

2.0

Registering 1,463 seed producers (50% females)

Production of 500,000kgs of certified legume seeds (an increase by 100% to
last year— to be channelled to Farm inputs Subsidy Programme.

30 agro dealers selected and mounted demonstrations across the country.
Training contract growers, local seed companies, agrodealers, MOAFS

extension workers, farmer association -— on seed production,
markets/business and reporting.
Development of molecular tools for variety identification (genetic

fingerprinting) for pegion peas

Computerised database management support for the MOAFS Seed Services
Unit

Carrying out the research to understand farmers" preferences (legume
demand) in different agro ecological zones.

Support to Seed Services Unit mobility — through purchase of vehicle
Development and launching of MASA brand —— umbrella brand for the
legumes produced from the project support,

Release of new variety of pegion peas ~ adopted by lleAl:S (drought
resistant, less prone to disease attack, early maturing)

Focus for Year 3

Year 3 builds on the key lessons learnt over the past implementation. On the overall,
the project plans to beat the target by 100%. Such scaling up strategy is much in line
with the contextual changes based on more demand for certified legumes under the
Farm Inputs Subsidy Programme. This is also built on the increased demand for the
legumes locally and regionally. The key outputs/deliverables for year 3 are as
follows:

1.

Increase production of legumes certified seeds from 500 to 1,000 metric
tonnes (an increase by 100%) -— we expect more contribution to the FISP

250 metric tons of basic and 30 metric tonnes of breeder seeds produced
Increased storability (reducing post harvest losses) - through construction of
storage warehouse at Chitedze.

Capacity development support to growers, agrodealers,

players like NASFAM, RUMARC, STAM, AISAM etc)

150 agrodealers engaged in the programme (through AlSAll/i and RUMARC)
Effective legume seed monitoring and verification ~~ through support given to
the Seed Services Unit (ie. computerised data management tools, laboratory
equipment, monitoring, testing}

in addition to mainstream activities for Year 3, development: partners
requested ICRlSAT to come up with a proposal for seed monitoring (FlSF’)

local seed
private sector

Process of Appraisal

internal review of the first draft was done by the agriculture pillar team at
the Embassy of lreland.

The consolidated comments were consolidated and discussed with lCRlSAT in
detail. A meeting was held on this.

The legume monitoring proposal was discussed by seed donors under the
FlSP (EU, lrish Aid, DFID, Norway, including WB}. Reference was also made
during the FISP task force meetings.

Key issues raised during the review/appraisal

Link the project to the ASWAp. There was less reference to reflect how the
programme is situated within ASWAp key focus areas.

Highlighting key achievements in a more elaborative way ~~with quantifiable
statistics

Categorise the project interventions as it fits into the objectives

More elaboration towards the support for Seed Services Unit ~—was not well
reflected, including budgeting.

Some sections missing i.e. Logical framework, budget for Seed Services Unit
Less reference to the MASA brand ~|inking with legume marketing
arrangements.

Need to include a midterm evaluation/review in year 3 — to assist in shaping
the future programme implementation

Including interventions on lessons learning and
communicating results.

Adding a section on budget notes/more iternisation, and limiting the salary
budget to last year figures. Also the budget has 2 scenarios, one based on
€500,000 and the other based on €627,596

more focus also on

10. As regards the monitoring proposal, the MOAFS was comfortable if the

process of legume seed monitoring is led by Seed Services Unit. This is based
on the mandate as per Seed Act which only gives mandate for the Seed
Services unit to collect samples, analyse and carry out vigorous monitoring.
SSU expressed strong sentiments to lead the monitoring process and not
ICRlSAT. Collaboration, as done through the ICRISAT project was deemed the
most appropriate.

Proposal Review Assessment

The revised proposal received has integrated the key comments raised by lrish Aid.
The following insights are noted, and well integrated;

6.0

l.

10.

11.

The activities have been grouped by objectives. This makes it easy to link
activity to objectives and the results to be achieved. More quantification on
the target has been made.

There is an elaborate regarding how the programme links to the lrish Aid
cross cutting priorities as well as hunger task force recommendations. The
50% participation by females continues to drive the gender focus. Strong
links towards productivity, soil fertility and nutrition observed.

Concise section on key achievements in the previous year has been added —
this makes it easy to compare the destiny by seeing where we are coming
from. Key lessons learnt have integrated.

Precise contribution of £150,000 has been dedicated to the Seed Services
Unit. The key activities under this are well elaborated —— good synergy for
developing monitoring and verification of the legumes under the FlSP. This
links well with the priorities in the ASWAp.

More private sector involvement: the programme scales up to integrate more
agro dealers, STAM, AISAlVl, RUMARC, NASFAM. This is very much in line with
project goal, and private sector participation in the food security sector.
There is comprehensive capacity building focus integrated in the programme
- this is critical for ensuring project sustainability.

Communication, lessons learning are well integral part. of the programme -—
this will assist to collate impacts gained by the programme overtime. lCRlSAT
will come up with specific case studies. All such efforts will contribute to our
communication strategy.

In addition to this, STAM is supported to conduct awareness campaigns on
the use of certified seeds - will enhance more adoption of legume certified
seeds by farmers.

The budget is realistic, with notes well elaborated. The budget based on
scenario 1 (€500,000) has been used.

Good integration of research as part of the programme to producing
improved varieties, testing conservation agriculture practices/on—station
trials etc.

Seed monitoring of the legume seeds (under the FISPl will be done through
the ICRISAT grant. Through this grant, all the deliverables for the monitoring
the legumes will be captured. lCRlSAT has agreed to cordially work with SSU
on this, as it has done in the past.

Way Forward/Recommendation

I strongly recommend to support the current proposal
to disburse as soon as possible.

The balance remaining from year 2 ($82,921) should be transferred to the
Seed Revolving Fund since the money is urgently needed to purchase seeds
to be marketed under newly launched lv’lASA brand. This is in line with the
ICRISAT’s request as per letter dated 4th October 2010.

and should go ahead

3. As part of implementation, there is need to r:t:>ntinue rriohitoringr the
programme in order to ensure that the programme is; implemented as
planned. Backstopping support to be made for communitatiorr, impact
studies —to make sure that they well focussed as reflected into the proposal.

4. A mid-term evaluation — inputs into the TCle and related rirr'oeesses from
Irish Aid will be needed. The aim is to ensure objectivity so that the review
informs strategic future programming.

5. The legume seed monitoring will be led by SSLJ as per mandate oi the Malawi
Seed Act and implemented through a sub—grant oi the lCFilSAT’ss; Malawi Seed
industry Development Project. Both SSU arid lCRlSAT will work in close
collaboration in order to ensure that there is good monitoring; rnechahisn'i in

MONITORING TO SUPPO RT THE FARM INPU SUB HIDE" PRIlMEIRALh’lh’TE
PROPOSAL
The Seed Services Unit is the only ofﬁcial institution in h’lalawi mandated to ensure that,
high quality seed of improved varieties oi“ crops are produced and made avzsiilahle to the
farming communin in Malawi. The Unit achieves this through a numliier of activities that:
include Seed crop registration. Seed source verificatitm. Seed crop ﬁeld inspectitizins. Seed
sampling. Laboratory seed testing. Check (crintnzill plots. Seed monitoring, and Farmer

training in seed multiplication. Therefore lClR’JSAfl' is not mandtsited to collect Seed

 

samples for testing as indicated in the proposal. llmvevcr. since lit": .EAT. is a major

supplier of foundation seed and of late certified seed of groundnuts and pigeon peas in
