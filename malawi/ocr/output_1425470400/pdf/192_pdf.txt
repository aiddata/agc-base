UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

Programme Title: Democracy Consolidation Programme Phase II

Summary

The GoM/UNDP Second Country Cooperation Framework (CCF) for the period 2002
to 2006 is designed to directly assist Government’s poverty reduction initiatives as
outlined in the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) launched on 24th
April 2002 whose goal is sustainable poverty reduction through socio—economic and
political empowerment of the poor. Good Governance has been identified as one of
the four pillars of the MPRSP with the overall objective of ensuring that public
institutions and systems protect and benefit the poor. The MPRSP also recognises
that at the heart of good governance is a vibrant and sustainable democracy. The
Democracy Consolidation Programme Phase II aims, therefore, at contributing to the
MPRSP and the Malawi Vision 2020 by ensuring that women, men, boys and girls
have been empowered to promote, protect and defend human rights and that there is
a demonstrated increase in civil society participation in the democratic development
processes. its objectives are to support the strengthening of institutional structures
and systems related to democracy and to support civic education for civil society
empowerment. DCP will have four main areas of focus, namely:— civic education on
governance; legal reform and administration of justice; parliamentary and political
institutional strengthening and; programme management capacity building. Through
this Programme, it is expected that by 2007, more Malawians will be capable of
exercising their rights and responsibilities and making informed choices; access to
justice will have been rationalised; mutual trust between government and civil society
organisations will have increased and co-ordination and management of governance
supported activities will have improved leading to better impact.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Situation Analysis

The Malawi Vision 2020 has identiﬁed good governance, with attendant transparency,
accountability and fairness, as one of the core challenges facing Malawi. The aspirations of
Malawians, as expressed in the Vision, emphasize the need for promoting and sustaining a
democratic culture that allows for equal political participation, devoid of corruption,
regionalism and nepotism]. In 2002, Malawi developed a Malawi Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (MPRSP). Within it, good governance is one of the four pillars developed
to address poverty in the country. The focus, in MPRSP, on improving development—
oriented governance is a recognition of the importance of good governance in development
management. Good governance in MPRSP is deﬁned as consisting of three elements:
political will and mindset, security and justice, and responsive and effective public
institutionsz. The achievement of these three elements is key in setting the enabling
environment for the efﬁcient and effective implementation of strategies for pro—poor
growth, human capital development and safety nets, which constitute the other three pillars
of the MPRSP. The Democracy Consolidation Programme Phase II (DCP 11) has been
designed to respond to the democratisation challenges identiﬁed in Vision 2020 and the
MPRSP, which are the major national policy frameworks for the promotion of poverty
reduction through good governance.

While the Government has initiated and implemented a number of reform
projects/programmes to promote democracy, good governance and public sector
efﬁciency, Malawi still faces enormous challenges in her democratic transition. A review
of past and present governance policies brings out a number of policy, institutional and
operational challenges and opportunities affecting Malawi’s governance system. Firstly,
most of the reform initiatives are currently loosely co—ordinated and poorly resourced both
from the human and ﬁnancial perspectives. There are several structures and institutions
that have overlapping reform activities but having the potential for rationalisation.
Secondly, the key provisions of the Constitution have not yet been fully translated into
actionable plans and programmes that can reinforce the evolving governance system.
Thirdly, corruption is growing in most of the sectors of the economy. Fourt'hly, democratic
participation is yet to be fully institutionalised as exempliﬁed by tendencies to politicise
development and promotion of actions that are likely to lead to national disunity. Finally,
there are also concerns about Government’s leadership and stakeholder involvement in the
governance process. These and the following speciﬁc challenges and opportunities (see
also Annex VI), as also identiﬁed in the MPRSP, call for government and civil society
action.

1.1.1 Fragile and Fragmented Civil Society

The enormous task implicit in promoting and consolidating democracy cannot be
undertaken in isolation by government. The area of governance requires broad
participation from all stakeholders i.e. government and civil society (in this document
civil society means the wider citizenry and includes NGOs, religious organizations,
trade unions, professional organizations, community-based organizations, academic
institutions, traditional leaders, business and private sector, women, men, youth and
children, social and political organizations/parties and pressure groups), based on a
clear understanding of division of roles and responsibilities. Consequently, civil society

 

: Government of Malawi — Vision 2020, March, 1998
Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, April, 2002

 

participation in ensuring good governance is indispensable. In Malawi, the history of
indigenous Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) dates back to the early nineties. They
are, therefore, an emerging sector with limited capacity to engage government on
behalf of civil society. The sector lacks both institutional and financial capacity and has
a weak legal basis. The work plans of CSOs tend to be event driven, resulting in
duplication of efforts in that different organizations end up implementing similar
activities in the same geographical locations, while other areas are completely left out.
These problems are worsened by the lack of networking, operational cooperation and a
common forum for dialogue.

Despite all the above problems, CSOs still provide a mechanism for government/civil
society dialogue. There is, therefore, great need to develop their capacities to enable
them effectively and efficiently carry out their mandate.

1.1.2 Inadequate Transparency and Accountability

The adoption and implementation of policies and legislation aimed at achieving the goal of
public trust and good governance is hampered by inadequate capacity in the public sector
to implement measures which will guarantee accountability, transparency, personal
integrity and ﬁnancial probity which, by virtue of their demonstrated effectiveness, will
strengthen conﬁdence in public institutions. The combination of centralised decision-
making and young democratic institutions has weakened the socio—economic and political
link between the government and the public in general. The consequences of weak and
poorly funded public institutions are corruption and lack of transparency and
accountability which have started to become endemic in Malawi, as frequently reported by
the media. Checks and balances exist for holding public servants accountable for their
actions. But due to institutional capacity constraints, institutions such as the Judiciary, the
Legislature, the Ombudsman, the Anti-Corruption Bureau and other civil society watchdog
organizations can only, at best, operate imperfectly. At present, the public is unable to
effectively monitor capacities at all levels of society to enforce accountability and
transparency.

1.1.3 Slow Democratization Process

While the Malawi Constitution provides for a level playing ﬁeld in political participation,
there is low or inequitable political involvement in practice. Generally, there is low
involvement, especially by vulnerable groups, in decision-making caused by lack of
structures, mechanisms and processes that would facilitate their effective participation.
The problem is aggravated by inadequate civic education, poor access to information, high
illiteracy rates, discrimination and political, racial, regional and ethnic intolerance.

The emergence of democracy as well as administrative restructuring has brought forward a
demand for the involvement of civil society in the governance process. This has emerged
partly as an offspring from political pluralism and partly in response to Government’s
restructuring policy and the call for broad participation in the governance process.
However, participation is hampered by the failure of public institutions to provide
information, lack of a forum for dialogue on national affairs and limited awareness for
engaging civil society in national decision—making processes. This results in Jack of
debate on national issues and raises apathy as citizens, especially the poor, experience
frustration when they cannot perceive their inﬂuence over public policy.

In terms of capacity to manage the democratic transition process, the institutions charged
with the task of managing the transition from a one-party, highly centralised government to
a pluralistic and decentralised system of governance reveal a number of systemic

 

 

problems. The core problem is weakness in the management capacity of these institutions
and structures. As a result, while there exist legal frameworks for people to participate in
national affairs and for the promotion and protection of the rule of law and human rights,
the operational frameworks have not been developed to guide activities in these areas. An
important consequence has been the gradual erosion of due process in upholding the
principles and values enshrined in the Constitution, such as separation of powers in the
conduct of government business and social justice.

1.1.4 Limited Observance and Enforcement of Human Rights
Since the advent of the new political dispensation, Malawi's human rights record has
improved signiﬁcantly. However, there is still limited observance and enforcement of
human rights principles. Issues of human rights have not yet taken centre stage and this is
because of:

(a) Inadequate knowledge on rights and responsibilities at all levels;

(b) Conﬂict between customary practices and the Bill of Rights;

(c) Low level of professional skills in human rights and law enforcement institutions;

(d) Inadequate systems and mechanisms to monitor human rights violations; and

(e) Insufﬁcient ﬁnancial and material resources for operations.

Due to limited enforcement of human rights, especially the right to development.
Government has not been successful in realising its stated intentions of reducing poverty.
As a result there has not been equity of development opportunities for all, especially the
poor and other vulnerable groups.

1.1.5 Inadequate adherence to the Rule of Law

Democracy thrives on the observance of the rule of law, and Malawi has made some
positive progress in this regard. However, there is still inadequate separation of powers.
For example the Executive, the single most powerful agency of state, could do more to
make the other branches of government realise their full potential.

The following are barriers to promotion of the rule of law:
(a) Weak institutional capacity for judicial and legislative branches of government;
(b) Lack of access to justice by the majority especially vulnerable groups;
(c) Inadequate human resource skills within the justice delivery system;
(d) Insufﬁcient ﬁnancial provisions;
(e) Negative public perception of the due process of the law;
(i) Weak linkages among key players in the justice delivery system; and
(g) Corruption in the administration and application of the law.

1.2 Democracy Consolidation Programme Phase I (DCP 1)

1.2.1 Background

Malawi was a one party dictatorship up to 1994 when the first multiparty democratic
elections were held. Following the success of these elections, a new democratic
Constitution was adopted in its ﬁnal form in 1995. The Constitution guarantees all civil,
cultural, economic, political and social rights, which are stipulated in international human
rights instruments. Government policy on political liberalization and democratisation is
guided by the Constitutional framework and supported by speciﬁc policies. Since 1994,
there has been continued progress in the consolidation of the fundamental transformation
that was introduced by multiparty democracy. In 1995, the Government established an
Inter—Ministerial Committee on Human Rights and Democracy (IMCHRD) as the body

 

entrusted to coordinate the implementation of the National Plan of Action in the ﬁeld of
human rights and other governance initiatives. In October 1997. the Democracy
Consolidation Programme Phase I (DCP I) was established as an outcome of an agreement
reached between the Government of Malawi (GoM) and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). The objective of this programme was to enhance the capacity of the
GoM, constitutional bodies and C805 to plan and manage governance programmes with a
view to building an open society governed by democratic rules and principles. Under the
agreement, UNDP’s role was to coordinate donor support to the programme, while
IMCHRD was the implementing body, charged with the responsibility to ensure efficient
management of programmes, resources and the provision of national coordination and
leadership of the programme.

The programme was successful in attracting support from Malawi's other development
partners such as Norway being the lead ﬁnancial donor, Finland, Japan and the
Netherlands. DCP I will terminate in July, 2002. By the programme’s end, approximately
US$7 million will have been spent.

1.2.2 Areas of Focus

From its inception ﬁve years ago, DCP I has served as a focal point for facilitating the
consolidation of the democratic process by supporting broad-based capacity building in the
following ﬁve areas of focus:

(a) Civic Education on Human Rights

(b) Conduct of Free and Fair Elections

(c) Parliamentary Mechanisms

((1) Legal Reform and Administration of Justice
(e) Programme Management Capacity.

The main objectives and summary of achievements for DCP I are presented in Annex 1.

1.2.3 Organizational Structure

The organizational structure of DCP I places the IMCHRD at the top of the structure. The
IMCHRD exercises leadership, plays a coordination role and has legal ownership of the
Programme. It also has the policy formulation responsibility and provides a forum for
wide consultation. It is mainly a Committee of Principal Secretaries and is chaired by the
Deputy Secretary to the President and Cabinet (DSPC). The Committee draws its
membership from selected line Ministries and Constitutional Bodies. including the
Parliament. UNDP represents the development partners involved in the programme, as an
observer.

Immediately below the IMCHRD is the Technical Committee whose main task is, inter
alia, assessing. appraising, vetting and approving project proposals to be supported by the
Programme.

At an operational level, task forces were to be established for each strategic area of focus
to manage the activities and operations of the programme, such as planning,
implementation and budget reviews. The task forces were never established.

Both the IMCHRD and the Technical Committee are supported by a Secretariat,
established under DCP I, which provides logistical and operational support. The
Secretariat is. among other things, responsible for budgeting, planning. implementation and

 

monitoring of programme activities. A graphic representation of the DCP 1 national
coordination structure is attached hereto and marked Annex 11.

1.2.4 Reviews and Evaluations
In May 2000, a Mid—term Evaluation of DCP I was carried out by a team of three
Consultants, whose ﬁndings highlighted the following weaknesses:

o "IMCHRD is not equipped to play a policy—making role due to inadequate
communication between the Ministries, as well as a lack of adequate resources for
supportive inputs.

0 Beneﬁciaries in Civil Society do not fully comprehend the mechanisms and linkages
that are prevalent within IMCHRD. This often causes suspicion and acrimony,
especially when requests for funding are rejected.

0 The Technical Committee did not have the requisite capacity to monitor the
performance of funded projects.

0 Assessment of proposals was limited to one pre-funding phase. The lack of monitoring
prevented timeous corrective guidance to prevent imminent failures.

0 Task force meetings did not take place. This was due to the enormous amount of time
and resources that would have been required for regular meetings, thus no professional
input or expertise was provided.

0 There was lack of civil society participation in decision-making, due to the lack of
funds to hold annual stakeholder meetings." 3

The ﬁndings of the Mid—term Evaluation led to the commissioning of a study to develop a
proposal for an “Integrated framework for capacity building for governance ami
democracy consolidation”. The general objective of the study was to develop an
integrated framework for a holistic approach to capacity building for governance and
refocus these into a more comprehensive proposal for a national programme.

The study made the following observations and recommendations over and above those of
the Mid-term Evaluation, which are considered relevant for the DCP concept:

0 "Not all ministries are represented in IMCHRD thereby making the effort not
holistic in nature.

0 Government leadership and coordination of the programme should continue
because government has a constitutional mandate for that role.

0 The ownership of the programme should be broadened by bringing in
representatives of other stakeholders in the area of governance from all sectors of
the Malawian society.

0 IMCHRD should be replaced by a National Committee on Governance and
Democracy Consolidation.

0 The Committee is to continue acting as a consultative forum for policy formulation
and advisor to the Programme Secretariat.

0 The Secretariat should be turned into a Programme Office. with more powers in
programme implementation.

0 The basket funding mechanism administered by the UNDP should be retained." 4

In the same vein, the Technical Committee was to be restructured to include
representatives of all stakeholders in the governance area.

1.2.5 Financing Mechanism

DCP I is ﬁnanced through a basket fund arrangement administered by UNDP, which is
also responsible for resource mobilization. The Governments of Norway. Finland.
Netherlands and Japan together with UNDP, basket funded the programme activities.

On the other hand, the IMCHRD is responsible for implementation of project activities and
disbursement of project funds to beneﬁciaries. Project implementation is subcontracted to
Government departments, Constitutional Bodies and C805. The IMCHRD is responsible
for sourcing quarterly funding allocations from UNDP for onward transmission to project
implementing institutions. The implementing institutions are required to submit periodic
and end of project ﬁnancial statements and project implementation reports to the IMCHRD
which, in turn, submits its quarterly expenditure returns and activity reports to the UNDP.

1.3 Other Programmes/Projects in the Area of Governance

There are a number of other programmes and projects in the area of governance. which are

natural cooperation partners for DCP. Of particular importance and interest are the

following:

0 Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP), which deals with reduction of the percentage of
the poorest of the poor.

0 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which is a national strategy for reducing poverty
levels.

0 Decentralised Governance Programme, which deals with the devolution of power,
functions and responsibilities from central to local governments and strengthening
local economic governance.

0 Civil Service Reform (CSR), which seeks to improve efficiency and effectiveness of
the civil service in the delivery of public goods and services.

0 Public Sector Management Reform, which is aimed at improving the quality of the
public service and economic governance.

0 The MASSAJ programme, which, inter alia, is addressing public safety. security and
empowerment of local communities.

The DCP will therefore strengthen complementarities with these Programmes and other
new activities approved for implementation through annual broad-based reporting on the
state of governance and democracy consolidation in the country. This will cover reporting
on democratisation and economic governance.

Annex 111 contains details of other Programmes/Projects in the area of Governance.

1.4 Development Process for the Programme Support Document for DCP 11

The process leading up to the formulation of the DCP II PSD was highly consultative
and participatory. It covered ﬁve critical phases, including the Mid—term Evaluation
and the development of an Integrated Framework for Capacity Building for
Governance and Democracy described earlier. The other three stages are described
below.

1.4.1 Draft Programme Support Document Proposal
In May 2001, a national consultant was engaged to develop a PSD for DCP II. The chosen
approach for formulating the document was participatory, covering wide scale

 

consultations with a cross section of the society. It also relied on ﬁndings from the Mid-
term evaluation and the study on “An integrated framework for capacity building for
governance and democracy consolidation”. Extensive cross-sectoral consultations
revealed substantial anxieties that underlie public perceptions of the democracy
consolidation process. Such anxieties, which are dealt with in some detail in Annex IV,
cover the following issues of particular relevance to DCP:

0 Inadequate Civil Society Participation, with particular reference to the necessary
involvement of the Civil Society in public policy formulation.

0 Public Scepticism, particularly referring to a registered “deep distrust. cynicism and a
growing acrimonious feeling between Constituents and their Members of Parliament,
the Legislature and the Executive Branch, Civil Society and the State”;

0 Fear of Concentration of Powers, referring in particular to the “alarming
accumulation of power by the executive arm of Government";

0 Political Intolerance, discussing the problem of inter and intra~party violence,
intimidation and harassment of media practitioners etc.;

0 Inadequacies of Political Parties, discussing the problems of weak leadership and
unclear ideological base, which is seen to have an adverse impact on behaviour and
performance;

0 Blurring of lines between Party and Governmental Roles, referring to the inability
or unwillingness to draw a line between party and government roles and
responsibilities;

Corruption, perceived to be occurring at all levels of society;
Social and Economic Development, discussing the adverse impact of the current
reforms in economic liberalization and privatisation of statutory corporations;

0 Fragile Democratic Culture, addressing the institutional and organisational
weaknesses of the present political structures and the economic. social, ethnic and
religious features impinging on them.

0 Lack of Management Capacity and Financial Accountability; which creates
misconceptions leading to erosion of public trust;

0 Decentralisation, addressing the need for improved relations and trust between central
and local governments, MPs and Councillors

1.4.2 Appraisal of the Draft Programme Support Document
An exercise to appraise the draft PSD for DCP 11 was carried out in November 2001. A,
team of four (4) local and international consultants carried out the appraisal.

The Appraisal Team made the following main observations and recommendations:

i) The programme focus needed to be redesigned; its operational mode needs more
coordination and information-sharing within the whole ﬁeld of democracy
consolidation and there is a need to focus more on empowerment of the civil society;

ii) In view of other donor-supported efforts in the area of governance, DCP 11 should
have two major objectives, i.e.

o empowerment of the civil society, in an effort to empower people from below in
such a way that the political system and society in general could develop a more
democratic structure;

0 facilitation of democratic development in society, i.e. building capacity for
information and knowledge—sharing and facilitation of different initiatives in the
ﬁeld of governance. This should inter alia include establishment of a data bank
of governance initiatives;"

10

 

 

The Appraisal also made the following proposals:

0 Recognising that the present organizational set-up has major weaknesses, the
organisational structure be simpliﬁed, including the abolition of the Technical
Committee, the introduction of a Stakeholder consultative forum and the
strengthening of the Programme Ofﬁce. The main argument being that the
Technical Committee does not appear to be a feasible mechanism for assessing
and deciding on project proposals;

0 A Stakeholder Consultative Forum should be established to assist in ensuring
commitment among stakeholders;

o The Programme Ofﬁce should be given the authority to run the Programme
within guidelines and regulations given by the Steering Committee;

0 The current ﬁnancing mechanism, with the basket funding arrangement
administered by UNDP, should be retained. However, UNDP’s capacity to
manage the fund should be strengthened. "5

The proposals and recommendations of the Appraisal Report are a refinement of the
recommendations of the draft PSD, Mid-term Evaluation and the study on “Integrated
Framework for Capacity Building for Governance and Democracy Consolidation.”

The Appraisal Report’s Chapter 6, Conclusions and Recommendations. is attached as
Annex V.

1.4.3 Stakeholders Consultative Workshop

In February 2002, a Stakeholders’ Consultative Workshop was held at Ku Chawe Inn,
Zomba, with the facilitation of an international consultant. The Workshop drew
participants from the Government, civil society, constitutional bodies, UNDP and the
Programme Ofﬁce.

The Workshop was convened to develop a log frame for DCP II and to further enrich the
process, in view of the stakeholders earlier inputs to the draft PSD and the appraisal
exercise. The forum also sought to ensure stakeholder participation at every stage of the
process to achieve the much-needed broad ownership of the programme. The Stakeholders
workshop agreed with all recommendations of the appraisal and used them to deﬁne the
areas of focus for DCP 11. The list of workshop participants is attached as Annex VI.

The workshop also revealed that the DCP will be expected to contribute to:

Free and fair elections

Substantial reduction in crime rate

Understanding and adherence by all Malawians to the principles of human rights and
the rule of law

A Vibrant human rights culture

Reduction in unemployment

Reduction in misappropriation of public funds.

Reduction in discrimination and intolerance based on gender, ethnicity, political
afﬁliations, etc

Following the Stakeholders Consultative Workshop, a drafting team for the PSD for DCP
II was commissioned. Its task was to ﬁnalise the PSD, in accordance with stakeholder
recommendations and UNDP guidelines.

2. THE DEMOCRACY CONSOLIDATION PROGRAMME PHASE II

2.1 STRATEGY

The Government of Malawi has decided to implement, in line with the Second CCF and
the MPRSP, to develop and implement the second phase of the DCP with particular focus
on capacity building for public participation in and civic education on the promotion and
sustenance of a democratic culture at all levels of society. This will, entail putting emphasis
on the involvement of civil society in the process of consolidating the current democratic
governance system. It will also involve building capacity of core governance institutions to
fulﬁl their legal and constitutional mandates to promote, protect and defend the democratic
values enshrined in the Constitution.

In addition, DCP II will address institutional capacity requirements for strengthening co—
ordination and information sharing within the whole field of democracy-building and good
governance. There are many projects either in operation or in the process of preparation in
the areas of governance and democracy, which call for better co—ordination. This
Programme will be the locus for the development of a holistic View of democracy and e-
governance, providing information about on-going activities, linking those that would
beneﬁt from closer co-operation and facilitating a more coherent approach to the whole
ﬁeld of democracy capacity building.

DCP 11 is planned for a five—year period (2002 — 2007) and will consist of three main
interrelated thematic components namely;

(a) Civic Education on Governance,
(b) Legal Reform and Administration of Justice, and
(c) Parliamentary and Political Institutional Strengthening.

Each component will have distinct sub—projects and activities implemented by designated
governmental or non—governmental organizations. The outputs of these sub-projects will be
expected to directly contribute to the attainment of programme objectives. Cutting across
the three thematic components above is the component on Programme Management
Capacity Building whose aim will be to develop and strengthen systems, mechanisms and
processes for programme implementation.

The consultative workshop developed a comprehensive Programme Results and Resource
Requirements Framework Matrix, whose elements are described below in Section 2.2.4.
The Matrix will form the basis for the development, by the Programme Ofﬁce, of detailed
activity and action plans, as well as a Programme Operation Plan to guide the
implementation of the Programme.

2.2 PROGRAMME ELEMENTS

2.2.1 Programme Goal

The goal of DCP 11 is a demonstrated increase in civil society empowerment and the
facilitation of democratic development processes through institutional capacity building.
This will contribute to the attainment of the following country’s Vision 2020: “By the year
2020, Malawi as a God-fearing nation, will be secure, democratically mature,
environmentally sustainable, self-reliant with equal opportunities for and active
participation by all, having social services, vibrant cultural and religious values and a

 

technologically driven middle-income economy”. DCP 11 will be one of the main
Programmes that will operationalise Pillar 4 of the MPRSP with particular focus on the
area of democratisation. The relationship and synergies between democratisation and other
elements of good governance outlined in the MPRSP will be monitored throughout the
implementation of this programme.

Purpose
The outcome indicator of the Programme is: “People have been empowered to promote,

protect and defend human rights. ”

2.2.2 Main Programme Components

As previously stated, the Programme will comprise of four components detailed below and
elaborated in the Programme Results and Resource Requirement Framework in Section
2.2.4.

2.2.2.1 Civic Education on Governance

Outcome Indicator: Malawians are capable of exercising their rights and responsibilities,
and making informed choices.

To achieve the outcome of this component, the following Outputs are identiﬁed:

1. A broad civic education programme, with appropriate baseline data and impact
assessment guidelines, developed and implemented across the country.

2. The civil society is included in governance and consolidation of democracy
initiatives

3. Partnership between Government and Civil Society organisations in policy
formulation, programme planning, implementation, and monitoring and
evaluation is established and implemented

4. Malawians are aware of the principles and requirements of transparency and
accountability, and are able to demand compliance

5. Malawians have been sensitised on the rule of law

6. An integrated Civic Education Programme for Human Rights Constitutional
Bodies is established and implemented by the Human Rights Commission

7. Malawians are sensitised on the principle of separation of powers

In order to achieve the above outputs. the programme will work in partnership with local
C503 and Constitutional human rights bodies namely, Malawi, Human Rights
Commission, Law Commission, Ofﬁce of the Ombudsman and the Industrial Relations
Court. These institutions will be required to develop project proposals explaining in detail
the project to be implemented, intended outputs, areas of coverage and target groups. The
applicants will also be expected to develop a proposed budget for the project. The projects
will be reviewed by the Programme Ofﬁce, which will make decisions on whether or not a
particular project should be supported. In deciding which project proposals should be
supported, the Programme Ofﬁce will, inter alia, take into account the following factors:

(a) Relevance of the project to national priorities;
(b) Area of coverage and target groups;

 

(c) Cost effectiveness of the project;

((1) Implementation strategy;

(e) Capacity of the applicant to implement the project; and
(f) Previous record of the applicant in ﬁnancial management.

The following assumptions are identiﬁed as pre-conditions for successful achievement of
the Civic Education component:

Govemment’s commitment to principles of democracy and good governance has been
backed by provision of adequate ﬁnancial, material and human resources to
governance institutions.

Currently human rights constitutional bodies, just like all other Government
institutions, are not adequately funded. This is because of prevailing budgetary
constraints. However, some of the institutions have been able to source direct funding
from donors to enable them carry out their mandates. Government funding of most
governance institutions is constitutionally guaranteed.

There will be an adequate number of CSOs available to address the above Outputs.
Currently, there are a number of €805 that have capacity to implement civic education

projects. It is hoped that these CSOs will continue to exist and that new ones will be
born to supplement the efforts of the existing ones.

Recent studies have revealed that there is a very wide human rights knowledge gap
between the urban and rural citizens. Consequently, DCP 11 will place great emphasis on
educating the rural masses that amount to over 75 % of the country’s population. The
Programme will endeavour to ensure equitable distribution of programme activities
throughout the country.

2.2.2.2 Legal Reform and Administration of Justice
Outcome Indicator: Access to Justice has been rationalised
Under this component, the following outputs have been identiﬁed:

1.

User friendly and effective legal system in place for the expeditious
disposal of court cases

Legal reforms put in place in conformity with international human rights
norms

A formal Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism established

In order to achieve the above outputs, the Programme will work in partnership with the
Judiciary, Ministry of Justice, Law Commission, Civil Society. the executive and the
legislative branches of Government. The projects will in fact be implemented by these
stakeholders with ﬁnancial support from the Programme. The projects to be funded
will be identiﬁed through direct consultations between the stakeholders and the
Programme Ofﬁce.

The following assumption is identiﬁed as the major condition for successful
achievement of this component:

14

 

0 Cooperation from the legal institutions has been ensured

The DCP will endeavour to work with CSOs and other interested individuals to lobby
the Judiciary, Law Commission and the other stakeholders to take up the challenge to
reform the judicial system and the laws that violate human rights. The Programme will
also support efforts aimed at lobbying the legal system to formally recognize ADR as a
way of reducing the case backlog faced by the Judiciary.

2.2.2.3 Parliamentary and Political Institutional Strengthening
Outcome Indicator: Mutual trust has been achieved between Government and civil society
organizations

To achieve the outcome of this component, the following outputs have been identiﬁed:

1. Freedom and professionalism of the Electronic and Print Media has been
achieved.

2. Human rights courses introduced in tertiary education and professional training
institutions for public servants especially law enforcement agencies (Police,
Army Prisons).

3. Members of Parliament more familiar with their roles in and outside Parliament

In order to achieve the above outputs, the Programme will work in partnership with
institutions within and outside the Government, e. g. Parliament, Media Council of Malawi,
Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA), CSOs, Constituent Colleges of
the University of Malawi, Mzuzu University and professional training institutions like
Police Training School and Staff Development Institute. These outputs will, mainly target
public ofﬁcials, journalists, Members of Parliament, lecturers, tutors and students. The
working relationship with stakeholders will be developed through inviting project
proposals for possible funding and direct engagement with the implementing agencies.

The following assumptions are identiﬁed as pre-conditions for successful achievement of
the outputs:

0 Media watchdog organizations play their role;
0 Education institutions are willing to accept the assistance
0 Cooperation from the political structures has been ensured

Government’s commitment to a liberal media movement was concretised in 1998 when it
enacted the Communications Act. The Act creates MACRA as a media regulatory
authority. The current challenge is to build the capacity of MACRA to perform, its
functions professionally. DCP II will, therefore, work closely with all media organisations
to ensure that MACRA takes up the challenge to regulate the media industry without fear
or favour.

With respect to the second assumption, the Government has already introduced a social
studies syllabus for primary and secondary schools. The Programme will, therefore, work
closely with civil society and other interested individuals to lobby the University of
Malawi, Mzuzu University and other training institutions to introduce governance and
human rights courses in their curricula.

 

Finally, the Programme will also lobby parliamentarians through the Parliamentary
Training Programme to appreciate the need for a Code of Conduct for the legislature to
perform efﬁciently and effectively its functions and mandate.

2.2.2.4 Programme Management Capacity Building
Outcome Indicator: The Programme Oﬁ‘ice is in a position, to perform in accordance
with its mandate

There is a recognised need for strengthening the management and administrative
capacity of the Programme Office so as to take the lead in governance
innovations, resource mobilization, information sharing and coordination, as well as
strengthening relationships between the Programme and other complimentary
activities. One important initial task is therefore for the Programme Office to initiate
the Capacity Building plan through identifying and contracting relevant expertise.

To achieve the outcome of this component, the following outputs are planned:

1. New Programme organizational structure and systems developed and
operational

2. A participatory implementation, monitoring and evaluation system with
clearly deﬁned monitoring tools has been prepared and is being
implemented

3. A Capacity Building Programme for Stakeholders has been designed and
implemented

2.3 PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

The biggest risk to programme/project planning and implementation is inadequate
Management and Administration, as well as analytical capacity. It is therefore considered
essential for the success of this Programme that the management and administration be
made as effective and efﬁcient as practically possible. In realising the above and in
compliance with the Mid—Term Evaluation recommendations, the Workshop addressed two
main organisational and management issues, i.e. Programme Organisational Structure and
within that, Management arrangements with particular emphasis on strengthening of the
Programme Ofﬁce.

In order to strengthen the decision-making functions of the Programme and to facilitate
civil society participation, a new management structure will be put in place to ensure
clarity in roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and broad ownership of the programme.
The new management structure is aimed at streamlining the organizational set-up, making
it simpler, clear and cost- effective.

2.3.1 Organisational Structure

In compliance with the recommendations of the November 2001 Appraisal and the
deliberations of the stakeholders workshop, the programme organisational structure as
presented in Figure 1 below has been developed. The main partners in the Programme
Organisational structure are:

The IMCHRD

The Programme Steering Committee (PSC)
The Programme Ofﬁce

The Stakeholders Consultative Forum

DCP 11 will be nationally executed with the Ofﬁce of the President and Cabinet (OPC) as
the implementing agency. It will be guided by the IMCHRD, being the Government focal
point for coordinating all activities aimed at consolidating democracy.

The IMCHRD will establish a Programme Steering Committee (PSC) comprising Principal
Secretaries in selected sectors, and will act as an advisory, policy making and controlling
body for the Programme. The PSC will be responsible for the smooth running of the
Programme and shall, therefore, monitor implementation and provide guidance to the
Programme Ofﬁce as well as intervene when conﬂicts occur. To ensure national
ownership of the Programme, the PSC shall comprise representatives of all stakeholders
namely: Government, Human Rights Constitutional Bodies and Civil Society
Organizations. The DSPC will chair the PSC. UNDP will represent development partners
on the Committee and will have Observer status. The PSC will meet ever quarter or
otherwise, as deemed necessary.

The Programme Ofﬁce will be responsible for the coordination, facilitation, planning,
implementation and monitoring of sub—contracted projects. The Programme Ofﬁce will
receive and review project implementation and ﬁnancial reports from implementing
partners. It will also be responsible for professional evaluation of project proposals. The
Programme Ofﬁce will prepare annual activity reports focusing on the results of the
Programme, lessons learnt and challenges ahead.

There will be an independent Stakeholder Forum, which shall act as a commitment-
building forum for the Programme. The forum shall act as an advisory/consultative forum

 

to the PSC and an innovative discussion partner for the Programme Ofﬁce. A graphic
representation of the DCP II Organizational Structure is presented below:

Relevant Terms of Reference are attached in Annex VII.

2.4 ACTIVITY PLANNING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
DCP II has been designed to focus on identiﬁable results as per Programme Matrix at
Section 2.2.4. The aim is to provide a strong and coherent monitoring and evaluation

system that will allow for easy learning, programme adjustment and performance
improvement.

31

 

At the beginning of each year, an annual work plan for the Programme will be developed
providing the annual performance targets and the budget. This will, constitute the guiding
framework of operation for the year. Sub~projects from implementing organizations will
include tools for monitoring progress towards set outputs. Reports from organizations
implementing sub-projects will be submitted to the Programme Ofﬁce at agreed intervals
for consolidation into Programme delivery reports for submission to the PSC and for
discussion at the Stakeholder Consultative Forum.

Monitoring will be done at three levels as follows:

(a) at the macro outcome level where the state of democracy will be assessed through
studies, surveys and other barometer tools working from an established baseline. This
is necessary for informing the policy process but also getting the people to understand
the state of play with regard to movement towards meeting national goals of poverty
reduction through good governance and democracy consolidation.

(b) at the Programme output level where the focus will be on trends towards set
objectives as measured by the indicators. This will be monitored through progress
reports and other means of veriﬁcation speciﬁed in Section 2.2.4, including ﬁeld
monitoring reports and surveys. The annual work plan will be the basic framework
for yearly monitoring which will focus on progress towards intended outputs and
subsequently results, regular monitoring by Programme Ofﬁce to verify and validate
progress regularly reported from project management of sub-projects and to use
lessons from monitoring for learning and improving the Programmes” strategies.

(c) at the sub-project level where the focus will be on tracking progress in the
achievement of sub-project outputs using the progress reports as the main tool for
monitoring.

Monitoring of the Programme will be done by the Programme Management using, where
possible, participatory monitoring mechanisms to ensure commitment. ownership, follow—
up and feedback on performance. The sub-projects will be primarily monitored by the
implementing organizations drawing from jointly agreed monitoring systems. The
Programme will be subject to a mid—term review and to an external evaluation at the
termination stage.

2.5 RISKS

The achievement of Programme objectives is premised on a number of assumptions,
which may facilitate or hinder timely delivery of Programme outputs or its very
existence. A risk analysis will be carried out as soon as practically possible to ensure
that the risks are minimized to the extent practically possible. The following
assumptions are risks that the Programme will have to take into account during
work/activity planning, programme reviews and monitoring and evaluation so that their
potential adverse impact on the Programme is minimized:

1. Involvement of Political parties as stakeholders in the Programme may
frustrate the aims of the Programme if party ideological positions are allowed
space in the Programme design and operations instead of being equal partners.

2. That Government commitment to the principles of good governance and
democracy will be backed by the provision of adequate resources for the
promotion, protection and defence of these principles and for sustainability
purposes. This Programme is inevitably covering sensitive ground in the area
of governance and democracy and therefore the need to have it secured in
terms of resources.

 

3. That baseline information will be readily available to establish credible basis
for performance measurement.

4. That Government will be willing to bring on board and work, with civil society
as partners in the area of governance and democracy.

5. That Human Rights Constitutional Bodies will be allowed to operate without
Government interference.

6. That Human Rights Constitutional Bodies will be willing to co-ordinate their
civic education projects through the Malawi Human Rights Commission.

7. That donor support, both ﬁnancial and technical, will be available during the
Programme cycle to enable the Programme expand and sustain itself. This is
the ﬁller support to enable the Programme achieve its outputs and therefore
resource mobilization should be a continuous activity.

2.6 GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION

At the beginning of Programme implementation, a capacity assessment covering the main
elements of the Programme will be undertaken. This will involve, among others,
stakeholder mapping and institutional analysis of governance institutions. The main
purpose of this exercise will be to assess the need for including a capacity building
component in the different stakeholders’ projects. In addition, the process of developing a
databank on governance will commence with information—gathering and a study of all
institutions implementing governance activities. This will assist in the early establishment
of baseline for various output indicators of the Programme.

The crosscutting themes of gender, human rights and HIV/Aids will be mainstreamed
within the four components of the Programme. At the output indicator level, the
establishment of baseline information will take into account data requirements for
disaggregatng information on trends, impact and developments in human rights and
gender areas. At the operational level, the three components constitute discreet strategies

for addressing human rights, gender and other governance issues from a holistic
perspective.

The Malawi governance system is an array of numerous players, organizations, systems
and processes. This makes both horizontal and vertical co—ordination and partnering
essential for the success of the Programme. Accordingly, this Programme will strengthen
partnerships with other development partners. This will be done through the identiﬁcation
of key bilateral and multilateral development partners, including civil society, within the
sub—components of the Programme for collaborative programming and cost sharing.

In line with the need for expanded ownership, the Programme will ensure broad
participation based on an understanding of division of roles between, in particular the state

and civil society, and will contribute towards the development and clariﬁcation of these
roles.

All project proposals submitted for funding under the Programme will be expected to
correspond to and conform with national governance and poverty reduction priorities,
failing which the projects will not be considered for funding.

In designing and approving projects under this Programme, the Programme Office will

ensure that there is geographical balance of democracy consolidation programmes
throughout the country.

33

 

 

 

All approved projects and work plans will be funded expeditiously as any bureaucratic
delays in funding will jeopardise the timely delivery of Programme outputs and will
adversely affect the credibility of the basket funding mechanism built into this Programme.

UNDP is expected to operate as a business centre, providing timely procurement and
banking/disbursement services, for the Programme.

The Programme shall encourage networking amongst partners implementing projects of a
similar nature from within and outside the Programme. This is expected to strengthen

complementarities and synergies when designing and implementing governance and
democracy consolidation projects.

The Programme shall build capacity of implementing institutions whenever necessary as a
way of responding to demand driven requests for capacity building.

The guiding principle behind the training in this Programme should be the inclusion of the

objects of the training, as opposed to only the subjects for whom the particular project or
activity is established.

Training is a process that can never be done in isolation from what it is supposed to be
used on or with. This Programme shall then ensure that training activities always take in a
relationship between those who are the primary beneﬁciaries of the training and those
institutions in society that are the objects of that training.

2.7 PROGRAMME INPUTS

The various Programme inputs are indicated below. Funding for these inputs will be
provided through Programme basket funding as broadly indicated in Table 1 and the
detailed budgets of sub—projects to be developed under each one of the Programme
objectives. A number of these inputs, such as levels of stafﬁng and advisory services, will
be determined through the needs assessment.

2.7.1 Short-term International Consultants

Several short-term international consultants will be needed, particularly during the ﬁrst
three years of the Programme. These consultants will provide advice on specific aspects of
democracy consolidation and good governance, particularly those associated with civil,
society empowerment from below in such a way that the political system and society in
general could develop a more democratic culture and good governance practices. Apart
from using the needs assessment to determine expertise required for specific Programme
aspects, a demand driven approach to expert requirements will also be used as the
programme evolves in the areas not covered by the needs assessment.

2.7.2 National Experts/professional Personnel

Professional staff are needed for the Programme period as will be determined through a
needs assessment exercise. These will constitute the core substantive Programme Team of
the Programme Ofﬁce. They will mainly be concerned with designing and improving
systems, methods and procedures for civil society empowerment in political and social~
economic processes, governance reporting, monitoring and evaluation, and supporting civil
society/constitutional bodies capacity building at community, district and central levels in
such areas as project planning and ﬁnancial management.

2.7.3 National Consultants

Provision is made in the budget for several person—months of assistance from national,
consultants. The exact number of person-months will be determined through the needs

34

 

assessment. However, provisionally and depending on the scope of the task, the consulting
period for each consultant is expected to range from one month to six months. These
consultants will be needed for the following tasks:

0 Undertake a Programme capacity needs assessment;

0 Undertake stakeholders analysis and develop a plan for involving other
governance partners in support of Programme activities;

0 Develop a database on governance and democracy which will include
programmes, players and location;

0 Develop a monitoring system on the state of democracy;

0 Develop a participatory monitoring and evaluation system with clearly deﬁned
tools

0 Develop guidelines and criteria for programme funding, including project

proposal, budgeting, reporting (technical/ﬁnancial) and activity/plan/time

schedule formats;

Develop Programme coordination mechanism;

Restructure the ﬁnancing mechanism;

Undertake Programme evaluation;

Develop an appropriate participatory IT system for information sharing and an

effective communication strategy that will improve accessibility of the

Programmes’ products and processes to the citizens and receive feedback on

delivery; and

o Undertake sentinel barometer surveys/studies on governance and democracy as
and when required.

2.7.4 Sub-contracts

Different CSOs, government and constitutional bodies will be involved in the
implementation of deﬁned projects under the Programme. These organisations will serve
as contractors to deliver project outputs, which will contribute to the attainment of
Programme outputs. The Programme budget incorporates the estimated costs of projects to
be developed and implemented by different implementing institutions.

2.7.5 Administrative support personnel
Administration support personnel will be needed for the Programme Ofﬁce during the life

of the Programme pending the integration of the Programme Ofﬁce‘s functions and
responsibilities into a restructured OPC.

2.7.6 Volunteer Staff

During the ﬁrst two years, two UNV experts in governance and democracy will be
attached to the Programme Ofﬁce to provide advisory services to the national experts and
skills training to civil society and constitutional bodies on identiﬁed areas of capacity
development through the needs assessment. UNVs will also be required at UNDP to
strengthen its capacity in Programme ﬁnancial and procurement administration.

2.7.7 Training

The needs assessment is expected to highlight institutional and human resource capacity
and skills gaps that would need to be targeted for capacity/skills and knowledge
development. Provision is made in the budget for short term local and international training
courses, attachments, twinning arrangements between local implementing institutions and
those from outside and study tours intended to strengthen the skills of Programme Ofﬁce
personnel and implementing institutions. For national professional and ﬁnancial
management personnel, who already have basic professional qualiﬁcations and several

35

 

 

 

years of experience, an effective way to strengthen their expertise is through attachments
and short courses in specialized governance. democracy and project management courses.
Pending the results of the needs, the budget allows for a total of 40 people to attend short
courses and attachments locally and abroad during the ﬁrst three years of the Programme.
In addition, the budget includes provision for four study tours of one—week duration in
developing/developed countries where good governance practices and democracy
consolidation activities are at an advanced stage of implementation.

2.7.8 Monitoring and Evaluation

The geographical coverage of the Programme entails costs for ﬁeld outreach and
monitoring and evaluation. Funds will be required for subsistence allowances, costs of
travel on ﬁeld visits by programme personnel and monitoring visits by UNDP staff. In
addition, funds will be required for Programme external monitoring and evaluation
missions. The Programme provides an allowance in the budget of US$25000 each year for

ﬁve years for external monitoring and evaluation missions based on current UN standard
rates.

2.7.9 Equipment and Supplies

Ofﬁce equipment will be needed for the staff at the Programme Ofﬁce, given that the
Programme Ofﬁce will have additional staff to strengthen its substantive capacity and IT
base. In addition and for the same reason as above, four vehicles will be needed at the
Programme Ofﬁce for ﬁeld outreach, monitoring and evaluation. These vehicles will
replace the current ﬂeet, which are to be boarded off in the near future. It is expected that

some implementing institutions will require vehicles as was the case under DCP I. These
will be decided upon on a case-by-case basis.

2.7.10 Operations and Maintenance
Funding will be required to meet documentation and reporting costs and. sundry expenses,

which include costs related to telecommunications. express mail deliveries, postage, e—mail
service and other unanticipated items.

The equipment will require periodic and adhoc maintenance and repairs to ensure its
smooth operation and minimize delays in accomplishment of set goals and outcomes.

2.8 PROGRAMME BUDGET

The Programme Results and Resource Requirements Matrix in Section 2.2.4 provides a
comprehensive budget mainly based on the different Programme outputs and the deﬁned
inputs above. The main output costs will be the cost of the different Projects to be
implemented by the different institutions. The comprehensive budget is an estimate based
on assumed number of institutions to be handled in one year and the average costs of such
projects. The Programme Management budget emphasizes costs related to the entire
capacity building aspects and operations of the Programme Ofﬁce.

2.9 FINANCIAL ISSUES

2.9.1 Funding

The ﬁnancial requirement to achieve the outputs of DCP II is estimated at US$113
million. The budget is a broad estimate, mainly based on the different Programme outputs,
the estimated number of implementing institutions and the average yearly cost of projects
to be implemented calculated using historical cost trends of DCP 1. However, this being a
demand driven Programme, annual expenditures will depend on capacity being developed
and the number of deserving projects generated by implementing agents. Expenditure will

36

therefore be maintained at safe levels of disbursements taking into account the outcome of
resource mobilisation efforts in support of Programme basket funding. This implies that
activities will have to be highly prioritised relative to available resources. These resources
are required to support interventions in the four key areas summarized in Table 1 below:

* Resources earmarked represent indicative initial funding of US$55 million from the Governments of Norway and
Sweden and, UNDP contribution of US$15 million TRAC resources to the Programme. A resource gap of
US$4,81 1,000 will be the subject for resource mobilisation and development partners are invited to join hands in
basket funding the Programme.

The estimates in Table l are an extrapolation of the Programme Results and Resource
Requirements framework, which provides the comprehensive budget per output. The table
shows total Programme resource requirements, resources committed! earmarked and
resource gap which has to be raised. The area of governance and democracy consolidation
will for some time to come be heavily reliant on donor funding. Government contribution
to the Programme will be MK32,000,000 cash (ORT and substantive funding to
governance and democracy consolidation activities) and MK4,200,000 in kind (ofﬁce
space). National funding of the programme will be determined annually following an
annual review of the Programme and will feed into the national budget exercise as guided
by priorities set in Pillar 4 of the MPRSP, and the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF).

This Programme provides a way for channelling donor funding to its four components. The
Programme Ofﬁce, with the support of UNDP, will develop and implement a resource
mobilisation strategy to raise funds and technical assistance for the Programme and ensure
that such resources to the various components are well coordinated. Part of the strategy
will involve drawing up a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which creates a strategic
partnership relationship between government, donors and civil society that allows for cost
sharing and or basket funding of the above components and, for joint Programme review
and discussions on government plans. Donors will be asked to subscribe to the MoU on the
basis of which mechanisms for project coordination under the Programme will be worked
out and maintained. Government of Malawi has requested UNDP to take the lead in
working out the partnership mechanism.

The main features of the funding system under DCP I, as described in Section 1.2.5, will
continue with the following improvements:

37

 

 

0 The ﬁnancing mechanism is to be restructured to enable implementing institutions
manage and account for resources disbursed to them in line with the outputs expected
from projects being implemented.

0 Guidelines providing clear and transparent criteria for Programme funding will be
developed as an aid to implementing institutions in developing their project proposals
to respond to Programme outputs.

Standard budgeting and ﬁnancial reporting formats are to be developed to simplify
budgeting and ﬁnancial reporting.

2.9.2 Accounting

Disbursements of funds under the Programme Ofﬁce will be made quarterly by UNDP to
the Programme Ofﬁce or to the implementing institutions. This will be based on speciﬁc
work/activity plans and required inputs developed or approved by the Programme Ofﬁce.
These institutions will be responsible for the use and accountability of funds advanced to
them according to the work plans/projects agreed upon. Implementing institutions will be
expected to professionally maintain books of accounts, in accordance with NEX
accounting and reporting guidelines. The institutions will, whenever required. ensure that
the books of accounts are readily available for inspection by the Programme Ofﬁce, and
for monitoring by UNDP. This calls for capacity building of implementing institutions in
ﬁnancial management.

Reporting on the use of funds by implementing institutions will be in accordance with the
ﬁnancial and technical reporting guidelines and the activity/plan/time schedule formats.
Financial reporting to UNDP by the Programme Ofﬁce on quarterly advances will be done
through Quarterly ﬁnancial reports received at UNDP by the 15th of the first month of the
following quarter.

2.9.3 Auditing

This Programme will be audited once after the end of each year by the National Audit
Ofﬁce or by independent auditing ﬁrms as has been the case during DCP I. The audit will
be done in accordance with the UNDP NEX Audit guidelines which, among others, focus
on:

(a) The rate of delivery;

(b) Financial accounting, monitoring and reporting;

(c) Systems for recording and reporting on resources;

((1) Equipment use and management; and

(e) Management structure, including the adequacy of internal control and

record keeping.

2.10 SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT

The Programme focus on broad based civic education and capacity building of civil society
and governance institutions demands that issues of sustainability are addressed as part of
programme design and implementation so as to ensure sustainability of DCP 11. The

following areas are outlined as relevant to achieving sustainability of Programme
objectives:

38

 

2.10.1 Policy Support Measures

The Government has put in place a number of policies to reduce poverty, empower the
citizens through their full participation in governance and development at national and
decentralized levels and, achieve the goals set in Vision 2020. However, to operationalise
these policies in a sustainable manner, political will on the part of government and
commitment from all stakeholders is required. The design of this Programme provides a
systematic way of strengthening political will on the part of Government and building
commitment from stakeholders around the Programme elements, its goal, objectives and
outputs. The re-organization of the Programme Management structure, and ﬁnancing
mechanisms is intended to strengthen Programme management functions as well as
achieve broad ownership of the Programme through strengthened partnerships,
transparency and accountability mechanisms. The focus on results is a means to measure
the contribution of this Programme towards the achievement of national policy outcomes.

2.10.2 Economic Issues

In line with the governance prioritisation set in Vision 2020 and its operational tool, the
MPRS, the design of the Programme puts emphasis on ensuring that its outputs will be
mainstreamed in the regular activities of civil society and constitutional bodies and that
these activities will be followed through by these institutions and organisations after the
end of the Programme. In addition, the strategy of integrating the functions and
responsibilities of the Programme into the management structure of OPC is to ensure that
the implementation of this Programme is centrally coordinated as part of government’s
overall leadership in implementing Pillar 4 of the MPRS. The strategy of strengthening
partnerships is to acknowledge the fact that implementing institutions may not have all the
economic resources to continue civic education and other capacity building activities
beyond the scope of this Programme. Therefore, there is need to link them to other
govemance/democracy consolidation projects/programmes that may have the ﬁnancial
resources to sustain the outputs of this Programme.

2.10.3 Institutional Issues

The fourth component of the Programme addresses institutional aspects of the Programme
for sustainability purposes. The focus on capacity building of programme management and
stakeholders, system development for project planning, financial management and
Programme coordination, monitoring and evaluation and, restructuring of Programme
Management is intended to ensure that adequate capacity is available or is built to
implement and sustain activities prior, within and after the Programme’s lifespan.

2.10.4 Social-cultural Issues

The main focus of the Programme is on civic education and civil society empowerment.
The strategies outlined above are speciﬁc on grass-roots bottom-up approaches to civil
society involvement in Programme design and implementation and in engendering the
programme through monitorable indicators. This will ensure that Programme Management
is sensitive to the need of engaging civil society in the entire process of programming
democracy consolidation activities. For sustainability purposes, however, more attention is
required in capacity building strategies to contribute to self—development of the grassroots.

2.10.5 Technological Issues

The Programme acknowledges the need to improve IT for information sharing and for
developing an effective communication strategy that will improve accessibility of the
Programme’s products and processes to the citizens and receive feedback on delivery.
However, the area of participatory appropriate technology development and management

39

 

is relatively new to Malawi and will need time to study, develop and operationalise
appropriate principles.

2.11 LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Annex I

MAIN OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY OF
ACHIEVEMENTS FOR DCP I

The following were the main objectives and achievements under the ﬁve areas of focus:

1. Civic Education and Human Rights '
Under this area of focus, the DCP’s main objective is to strengthen the national capacrty to

develop, manage and deliver an effective and broad based civic education programme.

Efforts at realizing this objective included the involvement of a number of Government
departments, constitutional bodies and C805 in the delivery of civic education on
democratic rights and responsibilities. Human rights awareness campaigns covered issues
like gender, voter education and general human rights education. This effort saw the
development of human rights civic education materials and the enhancement of the
capacities of civil society organizations to deliver human rights and general governance
civic education programmes.

Efforts at establishing and creating awareness on human rights through civic education
have made an undeniable contribution towards sensitising the society on its rights and
obligations. Education materials/manuals in the different priority areas where developed
and massive human rights education campaigns were conducted by several civil society
organizations in all parts of the country.

One of the biggest successes under this area of focus is the Tilitonse radio soap opera
produced by the Story Workshop Educational Trust (SWET). The programme proved
very popular and recorded a high listenership in 2001 as established by a listeners” survey.

Malawians are no doubt more aware of their political rights in sharp contrast to their
economic rights.

2. Free and Fair Elections

Under this area of focus, the DCP’s main objective was to enhance national capacities in
planning and conducting free and fair elections. Activities geared towards attaining this
objective included support for the computerization of the voters register, support towards
CSOs capacity building to conduct and deliver voter education, provision of technical
support to the Electoral Commission and provision of electoral materials.

The DCP extended assistance to the Church/NGO Consortium, Public Affairs Committee,
Civil Liberties Committee, Blantyre Synod to conduct civic and voter education for the
1999 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections and the 2000 Local Government Elections.
The countrywide programme is believed to have contributed towards the generally higher
awareness among voters. .

The Programme further provided support for the procurement of election materials. The
Programme provided technical assistance in the form of elections experts who helped the
Electoral Commission build its capacity for the conduct of the elections.

Finally, the Programme provided support to the Electoral Commission for computerization
of the voters roll.

41

 

3. Parliamentary Mechanisms
Under this area of focus, the DCP’s main objective was to establish an effective Parliament

capable of interacting with other branches of the Government and civil society
organizations.

Under this objective, the DCP sought to make parliamentary committee members and MPs
competent to effectively and efﬁciently discharge their legislative, representative and
supervisory functions. This objective was attained through a Parliamentary Training
Programme, conducted at Chancellor College of the University of Malawi. The training
programme was aimed at making parliamentarians more familiar with the roles and
functions of Parliament in relation to other branches of the Government and other
stakeholders. The programme was further aimed at sensitising the MP5 on gender issues.

The Programme’s main achievement under this area of focus was the running of the
Parliamentary Training Programme at Chancellor College of the University of Malawi.
The training programme, inter alia, covered courses on human rights. parliamentary
standing orders, gender relations, public ﬁnance and economy, public policy formulation
and analysis, roles and functions of parliamentarians, the environment and development.

Evaluations of the Parliamentary Training Programme have shown that MPs have found
the programme very useful. In fact the programme has led to a tremendous improvement
in the quality of debate in the National Assembly. The Programme has also helped improve
the MP5 capacity to perform their functions in and out of Parliament.

4. Legal Reform and Administration of IIustice

Under this area of focus, the DCP’s main objective was to promote the rule of law by
creating an efﬁcient legal and judicial sector, which is capable of protecting and promoting
human rights in conformity with international norms.

The main output of this area of focus was the development of a coordinated approach to
legal and judicial reform within the framework of promoting good governance.

The programme extended support to the Law Commission in the revision of the 1995
Malawi Republican Constitution and the Censorship and Control of Entertainment Act.

The Programme also provided support to Constitutional bodies (Law Commission, Ofﬁce
of the Ombudsman, Human Rights Commission, Industrial Relations Court) for their
establishment, operationalisation and capacity building for their staff.

5. Progamme Management Capacity

Under this area of focus, the DCP’s main objective was to build the capacity of
stakeholders in the above four areas of focus to be able to implement programme activities.
The programme was also mandated to build the capacity of the IMCHRD and executing

agencies of the programme to ensure efﬁcient management of programme resources and
timely delivery of outputs.

The main outputs of this area of focus were the establishment and strengthening of the
capacity of the IMCHRD and its Secretariat to guide the successful implementation of the
programme and provide operational and logistical support to the Programme.

The Programme has played a vital role in capacity building for stakeholders to enable them
carry out their constitutional mandates and also effectively and efﬁciently implement

 

programme activities. For instance, the Programme met training costs for numerous
ofﬁcials from the Government, the constitutional bodies as well as CSOs, who in turn,
were expected to share the knowledge gained with their colleagues.

Annex IV

CONCERNS EMERGING FROM CONSULTATIONS
WITH STAKEHOLDERS

 

Despite all the diverse initiatives and programmes that have taken place or are currently
underway, extensive cross—sectoral consultations with the public have revealed substantial,
anxieties that underline public perceptions of the democracy consolidation process:

(a) Inadequate Civil Society Participation

Any Government cannot undertake the enormous task implicit in promoting and
consolidating democracy in isolation. The participation of civil society as a whole is
indispensable. The visible reluctance to involve civil society in political decision-making
serves to reinforce the suspicion that Politicians and Civil Servants will only serve their
own interests whilst merely paying lip service to tenets of good governance. Civil Society,
therefore, feels excluded from the governance process.

(b) Public Scepticism

The freely elected representatives of the people in a democracy are duty bound to
effectively contribute towards the building of the institutional infrastructure. But the
current situation in Malawi points towards a deep distrust, cynicism and a growing
acrimonious feeling between Constituents and their MPs, the Legislature and the Executive
Branch, Civil Society and the State. This is ﬁirther exacerbated by recent Constitutional
amendments such as The Abolishment of the Senate and The Defection Bill, which clearly
display the inability of MPs to put the national interest above adherence to the party line.

(c) Fear of Concentration of Powers

There is growing anxiety within the populace and W5 who see an alarming accumulation
of power by the Executive Arm of Government, thereby eroding the present system of
checks and balances. The balance of power is further imbalanced by the fact that
Parliament relies on the Executive arm for funding, and this can be used as a subtle
leverage by the Executive. The abovementioned constitutional amendments have further
reinforced this suspicion.

((1) Political Intolerance

The growth of inter-party, intra-party violence, intimidation of the media etc. are all vivid
examples of intolerance between players in the political arena and this scenario is creating
tension and acrimony which detracts from healthy democratic activity. Seemingly endless
streams of political rallies are used as platforms for political viliﬁcation and character
assassination, thereby straining the delicate fabric of social harmony.

(e) Inadequacies of Political Parties

Political Parties appear to have serious weaknesses, which adversely impact upon their
behaviour and performance. These include weak leadership (Little or no renewal or
turnover), weak ideological base (thus impaired vision of the way ahead), dysfunctional
formal structures, no formal membership data, no formal revenue generation, lack of
accountability (no audited accounts — thus ineligibility to collect grants from Parliament).

(f) Blurring of lines between Party and Governmental Role

Both the ruling Party and the opposition have clearly deﬁned roles to play in the
governmental process, however, there appears to be an inability, or unwillingness to draw a
line between party and governmental roles. This is manifested in many forms, e. g. usage of

 

state functions and government resources for Party campaign purposes by the ruling party,
and boycotting state functions as a political protest by opposition parties.

(g) Corruption

Corruption is seen to be prevalent at all levels of Government. Stakeholders have become
very cynical in their assessment of integrity and honesty of Politicians, civil service etc.
This cynicism has not been helped by frequent media reports of corrupt practices within
key Government ministries such as Education and Health. The cynicism also leads to
disaffection with all players on the political scene and undermines the legitimacy of the
Government in stakeholders’ eyes. Indeed, this may be one cause for voter apathy and the
widening communication gap between civil society and the Government.

(h) Social and Economic Development

Economic reform and structural adjustment programmes that do not heed social realities
could destabilize processes of transition towards democracy and fuel social and political
tensions. The social impacts of structural adjustment programmes are being deeply felt,
whilst the achievement of growth with equity is not really filterng down to the grassroots
level. Current economic reforms do not ensure a social security net for the most vulnerable
and marginalized groups in order to eradicate poverty.

(i) Fragile Democratic Culture

The present political structure, though evolving, suffers from profound institutional and
organizational weaknesses that must be overcome in order to prevent serious setbacks. The
central aspects of this problem often stem from a lack of capacity in democratic
institutions, mechanisms and experiences or traditions and above all, the lack of a truly
democratic mentality and attitude, which frequently tends to give way to intolerance and
violence instead of unity of purpose and reconciliation. These shortcomings are related to
economic, political, social, cultural, ethnic and religious factors.

(j) Lack of Management Capacity and Financial Accountability

The perceived lack of transparency and accountability in Parliament, Public sector. NGOs,
Media have a tendency to lead to misconceptions, which, in turn, create suspicions in the
public mind. This then causes deterioration of conﬁdence and public trust.

(k) Decentralisation

The realisation that concentration of power is inimical to democracy does not seem to have
permeated into the political psyche. Instead, the norm appears to be competitive and
confrontational rather than cordial co-operation. For example, MPs view Local
Government Councillors with antipathetical suspicion and their relationships are often
confrontational rather than a co-operative effort towards realisation of common goals.

(1) Privatisation

The privatisation process disposes of Government assets to the private sector and
ostensibly uses the proceeds emanating there from in social development projects.
Therefore, loss-making companies, that are run by statutory bodies at huge cost to the
taxpayer, are converted into productive entities which increase employment and generate
Government revenue through tax, whilst, at the same time, funding is created for
development projects. However, the common perception seems to be that these companies
are being bought by foreign ﬁrms, with huge cash reserves, against which the local
entrepreneur cannot compete, while the proceeds are merely used to ﬁll the government
budget deﬁcit and not really used speciﬁcally towards development. Thus these national
assets are being snatched from the people of Malawi with little or no visible long-term

49

 

beneﬁts accruing there from. This concern is further exacerbated by the seeming lack of
transparency attached to the process.

(111) HIV/AIDS Pandemic

The inexorable spread of the HIV/AIDS virus is affecting the most productive sectors of
Malawian society and shows no sign of abatement. This has created an atmosphere of fear
and uncertainty about the future evolving into an attitude of fatalistic resignation.
However, the public feels that Politicians and Government ofﬁcials are merely paying lip
service by spouting appropriate rhetoric at opportune moments. The issue is not really
being tackled head on and this spells catastrophe for the future of Malawi in all aspects.

ANNEX V

CHAPTER 6 OF THE APPRAISAL REPORT
1CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS D

From the analysis of the proposal, the Team has drawn a number of main conclusions,

forming the basis for the recommendations that covers the issues in the Terms of
Reference.

Conclusions

As a programme proposal, the document is insufﬁciently developed by a number of

standards, as it is not covering integrated elements of a formal proposal like workplans,
timetables, budgets etc.

The document should rather be regarded as a concept paper, in which function the analysis
of the ﬁeld of democracy consolidation seems relevant and well taken.

It seems to capture the ﬁeld in a comprehensive and well—reflected way. which covers the
relevant problems and challenges.

As a potential programme, it also seems very much relevant and needed and seems
basically not duplicating other programmes or initiatives the way it is proposed.

It is however still not focussed enough and it does not seem sufﬁciently to exploit the niche
at which the analysis points.

The programme therefore needs to be reoriented and re-focussed towards a basis where it

can play both a strategic and a facilitating role in the whole ﬁeld of democracy
consolidation in Malawi.

In that relation, the organisational set—up of the programme seems not to provide a viable
mechanism for a professional, unbiased and efﬁcient management, neither for the linkages
the programme could provide in the ﬁeld of democracy consolidation.

Recommendations

The proposal needs to be revisited in order to produce a comprehensive and complete
programme document.

The programme should be based on two legs: empowerment of civil society and facilitation
of a democratic development in society.

The main focus area should be democratic empowerment of the civil society, which
basically is encompassing the area of civic education in the proposal. By this focussing. the
team will point to the need of making this programme the main programme for a bottom-
up approach in the building of democracy in Malawi. Although the focussing area should
be civil society in general and civic education in particular, the clients of the programme
could be drawn from everywhere in society, according to the objectives of the different
projects or initiatives within the programme. The main goal of this focussing would be
trying to empower people from below in such a way that the political system and society in
general could develop a more democratic culture.

51

 

The other focus area should be building a capacity in this programme for information and
knowledge sharing on governance and facilitate the co—ordination of different initiatives in
this ﬁeld outside the programme. This should include the establishment of a databank on
good governance activities and a capacity for analysing gaps and needs in addition to
linkages and duplications in the whole area of democracy consolidation in Malawi.

The programme organisation should be made more simple, with a two—level management
set- up. The National Committee should be kept as the policy-making and co-ordinating
body, but not enlarged with all stakeholder groups as proposed. The number of
representatives in the committee should rather be reduced, including in the committee only
those directly involved in the running of the programme. There should be a representation
from civil society, as proposed, but in the view of the team, one should not confuse
stakeholder representation with programme management in this committee. The committee
should operate as a normal steering committee or board, meeting maybe quarterly.

The Programme Ofﬁce should be strengthened and given wide authority to run the
programme, within policy guidelines and regulations given from the National Committee.
These policies and guidelines should however be discussed with the stakeholders,
including the donors and there should be a general agreement on the platform of the
programme. The ofﬁce should be established as a professional unit and ensured operational
independence, including assessment and decision on individual project proposals. The
Programme Ofﬁce should also be given a clear mandate, stating what tasks it shall

perform, what responsibility it has and what the relation to the different stakeholders
should be.

Although the Programme Ofﬁce might need advise and support in its work, the team
recommends that the standing Technical Committee be removed. In the view of the team,
the committee seems not a feasible mechanism for assessing and deciding on proposals, as
it confuses the authority of the Programme Ofﬁce. The team also doubts whether the
committee can provide all the necessary competence needed, without maybe be enlarged
even more, accentuating the already existing problems of this committee concerning
meeting schedules, bureaucratic way of operating and so on.

A better way to organise the need for technical advise and support would be to give the
Programme Ofﬁce the authority to seek the help needed where the exactly deﬁned
competence is found, even with the possibility of outsourcing tasks if needed, but retaining
the full responsibility of operating the programme to the ofﬁce.

The Consultative Forum should be made the main stakeholder forum, which should be
open for all, including donors and government. The forum could meet bi—annua‘lly in the
beginning of the programme period, then annually when the programme is well
established. The forum should base its discussions upon an annual report provided by the
Programme Ofﬁce, including an annual analysis of the status of the whole area of good
governance in Malawi. The forum should have no authority to instruct the programme
organisation, but the discussions in the forum should be fed into the workings of the

National Committee, giving input to the strategic and policy-making functions of the
committee.

The ﬁnancing mechanism should be based on a basket fund, thereby providing the
programme with a cost efﬁcient and uncomplicated administration of the activities. The
mechanism should remain at UNDP, but there is probably a need for strengthening the
capacity and competence at UNDP in handling such a fund.

 

In that connection there is also a need for developing a monitoring system, enabling the
programme to follow the different projects and activities closely in the ﬁeld.

53

 

ANNEX VI

PAST LESSONS LEARNT AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR
GOVERNANCE/DEMOCRACY CONSOLIDATION

During the past nine years, the Government has initiated and implemented a number of
projects and programmes to reform the governance system in the country. The
overriding objective of these projects/programmes has been to develop capacity for
engaging in multiparty system of governance and in enhancing the efficiency and
productivity of the public sector. Some of the lessons learnt from the implementation of
these projects and programmes include the following:

Government established the legal framework and institutions to combat
corruption and improve transparency and accountability in the management of
public resources. However, there is need for strengthening the human. financial
and material base of governance institutions working in the area of transparency
and accountability to be able to act as effective interlocutors of civil society.
Fraud and corruption can be averted through independence and autonomy of
action and strategic civic education. Current systemic institutional rigidities
make it difficult for constitutional bodies and civil society to exercise such
autonomy and independence of action.

Government established forums and institutions to promote broad participation
of the citizenry in the country’s political processes during the transition from
single to multiparty system of governance. The inauguration of the new
constitution still requires a systematic approach to governance. Setting an
enabling environment for fair and equitable political participation is essential
for raising awareness of citizens about their democratic roles, rights and
obligations. This contributes to nation building and unity of purpose in tackling
poverty and socio—economic development.

While Government has attempted to address the need for objectivity in setting
the national agenda and development priorities, the political discourse has
continued to emphasize patronage, partisan political development and regional
tendencies. There is need for change of mind-set in response to the new
Constitutional order. The strategic opportunity to translate constitutional
provisions and national development agenda into an integrated focused agenda
has not been adequately tapped due to capacity constraints in institutions that
are responsible for those areas. Consequently, human rights issues and the rule
of law have not been adequately enforced.

Government has undertaken a number of public sector reforms aimed at
achieving public sector efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public
services. However, there are signs of growing policisation of development
which has adversely affected the involvement of all stakeholders in. the
planning and implementation of poverty reduction activities. Political discourse
has deepened expectations of material gains in return for political allegiance
and this is creating a sense of dependency and excessive expectations of
Government. There is need for transparency in the political environment to
enhance performance of the public sector.
