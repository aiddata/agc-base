Project Summary

Project Overview: The sector goal is to contribute to pro—poor growth and poverty reduction.
The development objective of the project is to improve the socio—economic well being of the
local population and strengthen economic growth in 4 growth centres located in four districts
across the country. The project will primarily target the economically active poor. The project
with an overall cost of UA18.66 million (co—financed by the World Bank) for a five—year
period will seek to: (i) increase the income of over 20,000 households; (ii) support at least
120 sub—projects geared towards spurring the local economies of 4 targeted districts and
growth centres; (iii) support the formation, strengthening, and provision of technological and
business skills training to at least 2,150 local entrepreneurs and value chain actors of whom at
least 40% will be women; (iv) support at least 12,000 individuals (including beneficiaries of
the ADF—funded agricultural projects and the World Bank-funded Public Works Cash
Transfer program) to engage in savings and acquire business skills; (v) facilitate the District
Assemblies’ provision of business advisory services to at least 600 enterprises and 12,000
individuals (of whom at least 60% will be women).

Beneﬁciary Participation: The project seeks to develop and sustain an entrepreneurship
culture in individuals and groups for broad based participation in economic growth. To this
effect, the project will adopt a private-sector led service delivery approach through a Call-for-
Proposals for capable agencies to submit innovative proposals in the areas of association
building, savings mobilization, business skills development, product development and market
linkage activities. Decentralized planning structures, such as Village, Ward, Area and District
Development Committees, and Community Based Organizations will also play a key role in
the identification and prioritization of the type of economic investments (infrastructure and
non-infrastructure) to be undertaken in the growth centres. Participatory community
monitoring tools such as citizen report cards and community score cards will also be used as
part of the project’s governance and monitoring framework.

Project Rationale and Need: The Malawi Growth & Development Strategy (MGDS)
recognizes that broad based growth is more likely to be attained if there is promotion of local
economic development (LED) based on the existing potentials of local areas. In addition, the
February 2008 mid—term review of the Bank’s Results—Based Country Strategy Paper
(RBCSP) for Malawi has also highlighted the need for a multi-sector intervention that will
support local area development by promoting value addition and capacity building for
entrepreneurship development as critical in sustaining pro—poor economic growth in the
country.

Bank’s Value Added: The Bank Group has an extensive experience in supporting local
service delivery and integrated rural development in Malawi (through its social, agriculture
and water sector portfolios). The Bank Group is also an active member of the Donor
Advisory Group (DAG) on Decentralisation. Consequently, it has a comparative advantage in
supporting local economic development, drawing on lessons learnt from previous and on-
going Bank and other Development Partners’ (DP) interventions.

Knowledge Management: The project will make a deliberate effort to support the generation
of knowledge and documentation of best practices to facilitate organisational learning and
knowledge sharing.

Weak implementation capacity

for the LDF: The capacity of

the Ministry of Finance to
properly manage the project
within the LDF framework
could be insufﬁcient, in view of
the multiple projects it will be
required to carry out
simultaneously. This will be
mitigated by establishing a TST
to be integrated within the LDF
institutional framework during
the course of project

implementation.

Weakfinancial management
and Procurement capacities of
Ms: This weakness will be
mitigated with the roll—out of
IFMIS to LAs and the proposed
training of LA staff in ﬁnancial
management and accounting.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ADB GROUP
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAWI FOR
THE SUPPORT TO LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan for UA
14 million to finance the Support to Local Economic Development Project in Malawi.

I — STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE

1.1. Project linkages with country strategy and objectives

1.1.1. The primary thrust of the MGDS is to create wealth and reduce poverty through
sustained economic growth and infrastructure development. The strategy recognises that
broad based economic growth and development can not be achieved if rural areas with the
potential for growth are sidelined. It is on this basis that the Government of Malawi (GOM)
identified integrated rural development as one of the key priority areas under the MGDS in
order to stimulate local economic growth and reduce rural poverty. To this effect, through
the integrated rural development strategy (IRDS), GOM has further identified five mutually
reinforcing strategic areas of intervention, namely: (i) provision of basic socio—economic
infrastructure at potential growth points and other open markets for rural products; (ii)
developing capacity for local economic development through entrepreneurship and skills
development; (iii) improving agricultural productivity; (iv) promoting value addition and
related economic activities; and (v) provision of rural financial services to support economic
activities. The strategy also recognizes the critical role of the private sector and Local
Authorities (LAs) in fostering local economic development. Furthermore, the MGDS
recognizes that gender inequalities in accessing productive resources, development
opportunities and decision—making affect economic growth and development and hence seeks
to mainstream gender into the national development process.

1.1.2. In alignment with the primary thrust of the MGDS, the Bank’s RBCSP 2005—09 for
Malawi is anchored on two key pillars: (i) expanding rural infrastructure; and (ii) developing
human capital and institutional capacity. The recent (February 2008) Bank Group’s Mid
Term Review (MTR) of the RBCSP highlights local economic development as a critical
element of the Bank’s assistance strategy to the country.

1.1.3. In this regard, the design of this project is informed by the MGDS, the Bank’s
RBCSP, the Bank’s 2008 Country Portfolio Review (CPR) and other policy imperatives
being pursued by GOM, such as the National Decentralisation Policy, New Agricultural
Policy and the IRDS.

1.2. Rationale for Bank’s involvement

1.2.1. Poor local economic growth and development have primarily been attributed to the
pervasive poverty and chronic food insecurity in Malawi. These, in turn, have largely been
exacerbated by: (i) poor economic infrastructure, (ii) low agricultural productivity- from lack
of skills, technology and reliance on rain-fed food crops production etc, (iii) weak marketing
systems and market linkages (iv) low incomes, resulting from limited value addition in farm-
based agric produce, (v) limited off—farm employment opportunities, (vi) weak enterprise
culture, (vii) gender inequality in access to productive resources and services; (viii) weak
business development services, and (ix) weak capacities of local governments to provide an

enabling environment for private sector—led growth, among many other factors. This poor
state of socio—economic conditions in most rural areas has occasioned unprecedented rates of
rural-urban migration (5.5%). This has not only dented production in the agricultural sector,
but has also exerted profound pressure on urban infrastructure. In light of these, it is essential
to have an integrated intervention on local economic development based on the premise that
broad based economic growth and development can not be achieved if rural areas with the
potential for growth are sidelined. To this effect, the proposed project will seek to engender
pro—poor economic growth and tackle livelihood insecurities (including food insecurity),
through the development of selected growth centres, improvement of the local productive
activities, promotion of women’s and youth participation, facilitation of the diversification of
the household economic activities and the creation of jobs and incomes through enterprise
development.

1.2.2. The Bank Group has an extensive experience in supporting local service delivery and
integrated rural development in Malawi (through its social, agriculture and water sector
portfolios). Specifically, the Bank Group has just completed the implementation of the
Poverty Reduction Project, which has provided lessons that have inﬂuenced the design of the
proposed project. The Bank Group is also an active member of the Donor Advisory Group
(DAG) on Decentralisation and has taken the lead in setting up a Private Sector Development
DAG. Consequently, it has a comparative advantage in supporting local economic
development, drawing on lessons learned (see Technical Annex B1) from previous and on-
going Bank and other DPs interventions. The proposed project is crucial, as it seeks to
emphasize LED strategies that are territorially based, locally owned and managed and
primarily aimed at increasing productivity and economic growth opportunities in rural areas.

1.3. Donors coordination

1.3.1. The project will channel resources through the Local Development Fund (LDF)
mechanism established under the Ministry of Finance by the Government of Malawi (GOM)
as an inter—govemmental fiscal transfer mechanism for the implementation of local
development initiatives. The LDF provides a common platform on which GOM and DPs will
fund set priorities directly through local authorities. It also responds adequately to the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in terms of donor harmonization and on alignment with
country systems, as the LDF will be implemented utilising GOM structures.

1.3.2. There is a donor advisory group on decentralisation composed of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF),
the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), the British Department for International Development (DFID), the
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the World Bank (WB) and the Bank. The
DAG, under the chairmanship of GTZ, meets regularly and has been actively involved in the
design of the LDF through consultations. It provides a forum for donors to coordinate their
activities and share information in local government, decentralised governance and rural
development to ensure programme synergy and compliance with GOM policies. In the
process of formulating the project, the various missions interacted with the donor community
to inform them about the project and to benefit from their own experiences. Direct
complementarities and synergies have been established between this project and the parallel
World Bank-funded Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) Phase III APL II project, which is
to provide a seed capital of USD50 million for the LDF of which USD5 million will be used
to co—finance this project. The USD5 million is included in the total cost for this project and
will finance part of Component 1 of the project. To further harmonize with their parallel

support, the World Bank has agreed to: (a) use the same Operations Manual of the LDF, (b)
have joint supervision missions, (c) have common reporting formats, (d) cost—share the
operations costs (including management costs) of the LDF mechanism to avoid overlaps and
complement each other’s contributions.

1.3.3. Complementary synergies have also been identified between this project and the
following ongoing parallel interventions: (a) DFID-funded Performance, Evidence and
Accountability program; (b) UNCDF—funded inclusive financial systems project; (c) JICA—
funded, rural electrification project and One Village One Product (OVOP) initiative; (d) EU-
funded Farm Income Diversification Project; (e) German Development Cooperation—funded
operations in the area of mainstreaming local economic development issues in district
development plans, and (f) USAID—funded Deepening Microfinance project, and
Development Credit Authority facility with Standard Bank (SB) of Malawi to facilitate
access to finance for the project’s beneficiaries. Technical Annex C3 provides a more
detailed description of these linkages. During project implementation, the Bank’s Country
Office in Malawi (MWFO) will continue to collaborate with these donors through the DAG.

cycles; 4 vehicles; 4 sets of office furniture and equipment; study tour to
similar BSUs in region)

C—4:Program Support and 3.90 I Will support: (i) Operationalisation of the LDF mechanism:

Knowledge Management (recruitment of 2 Technical Advisors for the Performance and Urban
Windows of the LDF; recruitment of a procurement officer, M&E
officer, and accountant; 3 vehicles; office furniture and equipment) (ii)
Implementation of the project: (consultancy services for baseline survey,
mid—term review, beneficiary impact assessment, training of District
Assembly staff and pre—qualified implementing agencies in Proposal
Development; project launching; external audit; operating costs); and
(iii) Knowledge Management: (establish a knowledge management
platform with the parallel World Bank—funded project; support research
in activities in experiences and best practices; support information
management (data collection, storage and analysis).

2.2. Technical solution retained and other alternatives explored

Several alternatives were considered in the design of the project. Some of these
include: (i) the creation of a stand-alone Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the
MLGRD — this was rejected to enable the Bank observe its commitment to the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness by using the LDF framework and leveraging additional
financing through the World Bank-funded MASAF III APLI II Project; (ii) having a
microfinance component — this was rejected on the basis that the performance of the
microfinance components has been unsatisfactory and that there are already several
microfinance schemes in the country, so the project should be limited to facilitating access to
finance through linkages between enterprises and financial institutions, (iii) provision of
capacity building support to microfinance institutions — this was rejected because USAID and
UNCDF have two big programs addressing this constraint. Ultimately, the LED project
design was selected because it provides optimal use of limited ADF resources to generate
large impact and reinforces the Bank’s commitment to the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness and has synergies with several other completed and ongoing Bank projects.
Innovations taken by the Bank include: (i) the use of value chain based Matching Grant
approach to encourage public—private partnership and stimulate innovation and increased
demand for business development services; (ii) graduating the Public Works Cash Transfer
beneficiaries to economic development initiatives; (iii) fostering linkages with other ongoing
and completed Bank-funded projects to increase the development impact of the Bank
portfolio in the country (e.g. promoting value addition in closing projects such as the
Macadamia Smallholder Development Project); (iv) piloting of the establishment of Business
Support Units in four districts; and (v) linking the monitoring and evaluation framework of
the project to local governance and accountability initiatives being promoted by other partner
donors (6. g. the World Bank and DFID).

2.3. Project type

The project will channel resources through the LDF to support economic investments
at the local level. Using the LDF as an approach for financing local development is justified
on the basis that it provides a common platform on which GOM and DPs will fund set
priorities within a particular local area using a standardised and transparent mechanism which
allow for harmonised national resource mobilisation, equitable allocation of development
resources, effective development implementation capacities and results accountability. It also
responds adequately to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

2.4. Project cost and financing arrangements

Total project cost is UA 18.66 million (USD 30.39 million) , of which the total ADF
and World Bank contributions amount to UA 14.00 million and UA 3.04 million, or 75.4 and
16.3 percent of total project cost respectively, excluding taxes and customs duties. The total
ADF and World Bank contributions will be provided as a loan and used to finance the
project’s total foreign exchange costs (UA 2.34 million) and part of the local currency costs
(UA 16.32 million). A Government counterpart contribution of at least 10.4% of the ADF
Loan, amounting to UA 1.62 million is required. Tables below summarize the estimated cost
of the project by component.

2.5. Project area and target population

The principal target group for the project are the economically active rural poor who
have the potential to embark on business ventures which will bring value addition to their on-
farm and off-farm commercial activities. The project will also support some of the core poor
that receive public works cash transfers from the World Bank-funded MASAF APLII Project
by forming them into business groups and introducing them to savings. Gender
considerations will be made in the selection of beneficiaries. It is estimated that about 20,000
households will participate in the project. Whereas, the activities under the Deepening
Enterprise Development component of the project will be nation—wide through Call—for—
Proposals, the Growth Centres Development component will initially be restricted to Growth
Centres in four districts with the possibility of extending to additional districts subject to
availability of resources and evidence of demonstrable impact. The four Growth Centres
initially selected are: Jenda in Mzimba District, Monkey Bay in Mangochi District, Chitekesa
in Phalombe District and Malomo in Ntchisi District. These centres are selected on the basis
of: (i) the existence of a basic physical infrastructure support base; (ii) the economic growth
potentials; (iii) limited exploitation of agri—business opportunities; (iv) trade opportunities for
some commodities; (v) potential number of beneficiaries; (vi) opportunities for participation
by women and youth; (vii) potentials for job creation; and (viii) potential linkages and
synergies with other ongoing projects being funded by the Bank and other DPs.

2.6. Participatory processes of design and implementation

The Bank’s project formulation team held field meetings and focus group discussions
with several stakeholders including GOM officials, local government authorities, private
sector representatives, civil society organizations (including village/district development
committees), farmer groups, and DPs including international and local NGOs. Participatory
appraisal techniques will be used for the identification and prioritization of economic
investments to be undertaken in the growth centres. This will ensure active and widespread
participation of all key stakeholders (communities, existing local institutional structures, and
private sector agents) at various stages of project implementation. Community participatory
processes will be further enhanced with the proposed M&E framework for the project,
through the use of participatory community monitoring tools such as citizen report cards and
community score cards, which are tools to be used to solicit beneficiary feedback on the
project implementation process and ensure that project activities are executed in a satisfactory
and sustainable manner.

2.7. Experience and lessons reﬂected in project design

The project design has benefited from lessons learnt from the implementation of Bank-
funded projects, as well as experiences gained from those funded by other donors as
specifically detailed under Technical Annex Bl. These lessons include: (a)
coordinated/harmonised implementation arrangements achieves greater impact and cost—
effectiveness than stand—alone projects, if there is sufficient capacity in the concerned
Ministry ; (b) monitoring and evaluation which takes into account community governance
structures and tools is critical for results accountability; (c) private-sector service delivery

 

enhances sustainability of enterprise development interventions; (d) the need to train potential
applicants in the area proposal development to engender demand of matching grant resources.
These lessons have been incorporated into the project design by using the LDF framework for
a harmonised implementation arrangement enhanced by increasing the capacity of the
Directorate of Debt & Aid Management with a Technical Support Team (TST) to be
integrated in the LDF institutional framework. The project will mainstream community
accountability tools in the M&E framework of the project to enhance results accountability.
In addition, the project places heavy reliance on private sector delivery channels to deepen
enterprise development and also promote responsiveness to enterprise demand and
commercial sustainability for the value addition activities of the project. Component 1 has a
cost—sharing (matching grant) approach. Based on lessons learnt, training in proposal
development will be provided to all potential applications of the matching grant resources
under Component 1. The innovation encouraged in the proposals will also generate
demonstration effects that are expected to facilitate further replication by other actors.
Lessons from the Bank’s agricultural portfolio in Malawi and the IFAD-funded Rural
Livelihoods and Economic Enhancement Project reveal the need for an entire value chain
analysis in some key commodities to enhance productivity and growth in a pre—dominant
agro—based economy. This project will therefore build in a value chain analysis of key
commodities in the growth centres to explore areas where the project could intervene for
value addition. Other generic lessons from the recent review of the Bank’s portfolio in
Malawi have also been taken into consideration. These include: (i) ensuring adequate
stakeholder participation in the design of the project and minimized loan conditions to
enhance the project’s Quality—at-Entry; (ii) making a provision for technical audits and
community accountability tools to ensure fiduciary assurance; and (iii) weaknesses in results
orientation in Bank-funded projects leading to ambiguity about impact.

2.8. Key Performance Indicators

The Results Framework of the project has identified five outcome/impact indicators
and several output indicators for each component. The outcome/impact indicators are
outlined below, whereas the output indicators for each component are outlined under Table
B1. The outcome/impact indicators are:

0 Reduction of poverty incidence

% reduction in rural-urban migration

% increase in smallholder share of GDP
Number of households increasing their incomes
Increased number of new business start—ups

III — PROJECT FEASIBILITY
3.1. Economic and financial performance

Table C.I.' key economic and ﬁnancial ﬁgures

 

FIRR, NPV (base case) (21%, NPV value)
EIRR (base case) (25%)

NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B6

 

 

 

The overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the project ranges from 25% (Base
Case) to 36%, which implies that the proposed project is economically viable because the
rates of return are higher than the cost of capital (at 12%). The Cost—Effectiveness Analysis
carried out on the LDF mechanism also show that using the proposed LDF approach is 20—
50% less costly than having stand—alone projects on similar community infrastructure and
local development.

3.2. Environmental and Social impacts
Environment

3.2.1. In accordance with the Bank's environment and social safeguard policies, the project
is classified as Category 2. The project will primarily aim at improving the socio—economic
wellbeing of the local population through the development of an entrepreneurship culture and
targeted capacity building activities geared towards enhancing local economic development.
In addition, based on the outcomes of the detailed economic assessment to be carried out in
the selected growth centres, the project will support the construction of basic economic
development infrastructure and value addition activities such as markets, processing and
storage facilities, and market access roads. In an effort to identify, assess, mitigate and
monitor potential adverse environmental and social impacts of future sub—projects, GOM has
prepared an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) which will be updated in
the course of project implementation to take into account relevant new experiences. The
Malawi Department of Environmental Affairs will be responsible for overseeing the
implementation of the provisions of the ESMP.

Climate Change

3.2.2. The project will support economic development in Malawi, however, it is not
expected to generate significant CO2 emissions. According to official reports, the Malawian
per capita CO2 emission of 20kg c/year is about the lowest in the world and 60 times lower
than the world average. It is reported that the development of CO2 emission is slow compared
to other African countries. On the basis of the observed models, the consequences of climate
change on future LED project impact are estimated to be small. These will be closely
monitored during project implementation by the Malawi Department of Environmental
Affairs.

Gender

3.2.3 Women in Malawi play a significant role in the country’s economic and social
development, as head of households (26.6%), participation in agriculture labor force (70%)
and owning 34% of the enterprises individually and 30% jointly with their spouses. Most of
women owned enterprises (97%) are considered micro and struggle to survive. Studies have
shown that women owned enterprises have very small capital base and often use their
business profits for household needs. Their productivity and profitability also suffer from
limited skills training, lack of access to appropriate technology, business development
services and lack of access to both product and inputs markets. To this effect, the project will
apply a multi—faceted approach to increase the market outcome for women by (i) enhancing
the value of women dominated production and processing through skills training, use of
technologies, using a group (women only or mixed groups established where the groups will
be encouraged to jointly produce, quality standard, labelling and marketing will be
promoted); (ii) promoting women entrepreneurs (comprising of at least 40% of the envisaged
2,150 beneficiaries for the business development services and 40% of the 12,000 of the
beneficiaries of the savings mobilisation) to venture into the segment of the value chain often

10

dominated by men, for example, as distributors and marketers; (iii) building women’s
leadership skills to participate in the governance of economic associations such as
associations and cooperatives; (iv) sensitizing men to support women’s enhanced role in the
value chain development and (v) building the capacity of business associations and those of
the local government institutions to ensure gender responsive service delivery at the local
level.

Social

3.2.4. The project will support a range of initiatives at the local level with the aim of
supporting the emergence of MSEs which will be involved in a range of diverse economic
activities that will contribute towards improving the household income and socio—economic
well being of at least 20,000 households across the country, especially in terms of food
security and access to social services. The project will encourage the use of labor-intensive
methods in the implementation of the sub—projects under the Growth Centres Development
component. This will create pro—poor job opportunities, in addition to the collective and
household assets that would be built through the productive investments undertaken under the
component. The encouragement of community participation in the project’s activities will
enhance positive social equity outcomes through (i) reducing isolation and improving access
to economic opportunities for the poor and (ii) decreasing social exclusion of certain groups
such as women and the unemployed youth (the main group involved in rural-urban
migration). The project’s emphasis on partnerships between the local government agencies,
civil society and the private sector will be crucial in strengthening local social capital and in
supporting community—based economic development interventions that will improve the
quality of life of the local population in all aspects.

Involuntary resettlement

3.2.5. The project is not expected to entail any involuntary resettlement. The envisaged
construction under the Growth Centres Development component will be taking place on
public land, and the rehabilitation of the other facilities will be providing improvements on
existing building and infrastructure. As for the Deepening Enterprise Development
component, none of the activities foreseen will entail any relocation or resettlement either.

IV — IMPLEMENTATION

4.1. Implementation arrangements

Institutional

4.1.1. In observance of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the project shall not set—
up any new PIU. Instead, project resources will be channeled through the LDF, established
under the Ministry of Finance. The main management features of the LDF are:

0 A Steering Committee for policy oversight and representing the main national
coordinating Ministries and chaired by the Secretary to Treasury;

o A National Technical Advisory Committee (NTAC) chaired by Ministry of Local
Government will review and approve proposals and investment plans on behalf of the
Steering Committee;

0 A National Local Government Finance Committee (NLGF C) to coordinate Financial
Reporting from LAs’ and issue resource allocation guidelines.

4.1.2. A lean Technical Support Team (TST) will be established within the Directorate of
Debt and Aid Management to provide the needed fiduciary and accountability support to the

11

projects funding the LDF including this one. Specifically, the TST will (i) track the inﬂows
of funds from both Development Partners and Government based on an agreed Programme of
Work; (ii) be responsible for releasing funds to the Assemblies as advised by the NLGFC
based on the agreed resource transfer formula; (iii) harmonising donor financing standards
and agreements; (iv) finance agreed—to studies, evaluations, and processes that support Public
and Social Accountability as part of linking resource ﬂows with development outcomes; and
(v) undertake knowledge building functions to facilitate organization learning and knowledge
sharing. At the DAs level, the Directorate of Planning and Development will assist and
provide operational support, prior to and during the implementation of project activities. The
project aims to use to the extent possible existing district and community planning and
development structures such as the District Executive Committee, Area Development
Committee and Village Development Committee at the local level in the implementation of
project activities. The institutional roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders are
described under Technical Annex C2.

Procurement

4.1.3. All procurement of goods and works and acquisition of consulting services financed by
the Bank will be in accordance with the Bank's Rules of Procedure for Procurement of Goods
and Works or, as appropriate, Rules of Procedure for the Use of Consultants, using the relevant
Bank Standard Bidding Documents.

4.1.4. For community and village level activities, the procurement modes for works, goods
and services will be guided by the LDF Operations Manual and Procedures. The Bank’s
approval of the Operations Manual is a Condition Precedent to First Disbursement. The
Operations Manual should be acceptable to the ADF..

Disbursement

4.1.5. A dollar—denominated Special Account (SA) will be opened at the Reserve Bank of
Malawi to receive the proceeds of the ADF loan. In addition, GOM will open and maintain 3
Local Currency Accounts (LCA) at banks acceptable to ADF. The first LCA will be used to
deposit part of loan resources for the “Community window” of investment activities. The
second LCA will be used to deposit the allocated resources for the “Urban window” of
investment activities. The third LCA will be used to deposit the allocated resources for the
“Performance window” of investment activities. A fourth account should be opened for
financing the activities under the Program Support and Knowledge Management component.
The ADF will replenish the SA after the Ministry of Finance has provided valid justification
for the use of at least fifty percent of the previous deposit and in compliance with the
requirements stipulated in the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook. The opening of the accounts
is a condition precedent to first disbursement.

Financial Management

4.1.6. GOM uses a computerized (IFMIS) central accounting system. IFMIS will be used for
central budgeting, for cheque initiation and generation. This system is being rolled out to
DAs by the NLGFC and the Accountant Generals Department with support from the
GOM/World Bank-funded Financial Management Transparency and Accountability Project
(FIMTAP). This roll—out is expected to be completed by June 2010. Meanwhile, at the DA
Level and Community Level, a manual spreadsheet based accounting will be used to account
for the project funds until IFMIS is rolled out to the districts. The DAs have varying financial
management capacity. While some assemblies have adequate staff numbers and competence,
some are weak in terms of quality and/or numbers. These gaps are expected to be filled under

l2

FIMTAP and the World Bank-funded MASAF III APL II Project (which is being
implemented in parallel to this project). Internal Audit will be carried out by the
Govemment’s Central Internal Audit Unit (CIAU). At the moment, the CIAU has some
capacity gaps in that there are some key positions that need to be filled. The Unit is in the
process of recruiting three principal auditors and other audit staff. To meet fiduciary
requirements, Project accounts will be audited by the National Audit Office. However, due to
the capacity constraints within the NAG, the project will support the services of external
auditors to be engaged by the NAG to carry out the external audit. The Ministry of Finance
shall submit to the Bank audited financial statements at least 6 months after the end of the
financial year. The external auditors, during their annual audits, would express an opinion on
the utilization of the Loan’s proceeds, and compliance with the ADF Loan Agreement. They
will also make recommendations for improving any systemic weaknesses if identified.
Follow—up procedures for audit recommendations would be in line with Bank practice.

4.2. Monitoring

4.2.1. The Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD) is responsible for
monitoring and evaluating the outputs and outcomes of development interventions as they
relate to achieving the MGDS. In this regard, in liaison with MLGRD, the MEPD will be
responsible for M&E and will ensure that all stakeholders are taking part in the monitoring of
project processes. The project will strengthen the M&E capacities of DAs and establish
linkages with DFID and the World Bank on the use of participatory community monitoring
tools such as citizen report cards and community score cards to ensure that the project
activities are executed in a satisfactory manner and benefits are sustainable.

4.2.2. In accordance with Bank practice, the Ministry of Finance will submit progress
reports to the Bank on a quarterly basis. The M&E expert to be recruited under the project
will also be responsible for making sure that the M&E system is consistent with the results-
based matrix of the project and informed by (a) the baseline survey to be undertaken at the
beginning of the project, (b) the key performance indicators of the project, and (c) the results
framework on the Bank’s RBCSP. This will be further complemented with (i) the
establishment of a technical monitoring committee comprising of key stakeholders at the
district level; (ii) a beneficiary impact assessment to be carried out at the end of the second
year; (iii) supervision missions of the Bank (some jointly with World Bank), a mid-term
review and an end—of—project impact study at the completion of the project by GOM and the
Bank.

4.3. Governance

The project will seek to contribute towards the promotion of good governance, with a
specific focus on citizen empowerment to demand accountability for quality service delivery
and promotion of professional and ethical standards in public service management. To this
effect, the project will complement the activities of the parallel World Bank-funded MASAF
III APLII Project and DFID-funded Performance, Evidence and Accountability Program
geared towards the promotion of transparency and accountability in the delivery of services.
The project will also leverage economic governance benefits from the parallel MASAF III
APL II Project which will be supporting the Anti—Corruption Bureau to enable them
efficiently and effectively carry out their role especially as it relates to the operations of the
LDF.

13

4.4. Sustainability

The sustainability of the project will be enhanced by Govemment’s commitment to
local economic development as demonstrated in the MGDS and its broader public sector
reform program. In addition, the design of the LDF demonstrates that the mainstreaming of
LDF processes within the public expenditure management framework will allow for local
economic development to be mainstreamed across all sectors at the national and local levels.
It also allows for local economic development to be better aligned with the process of
decentralization and devolution of service delivery to Local Authorities. Other important
elements ensuring project sustainability relates to (i) the involvement of the private sector and
communities in the implementation of the project and (ii) the requirement for all sub—projects
to be funded under the Growth Centres Development component to determine their economic
and financial feasibility as a prerequisite for project support.

4.5. Risk management

4.5.]. Slow pace of decentralization: In the last 15 years, the country has had elected
Councillors for only 5 years and the main strategy should be to strengthen the administrative
arm of DAs in readiness for when the elected arm will be in place (expected after the 2009
elections). This risk is being mitigated by the local authority capacity enhancement activities
being supported by the World Bank, DFID and the German Development Cooperation
(delivered by GTZ and DED).

4.5.2. Weak implementation capacity for the LDF: The capacity of the Ministry of Finance
to properly manage the project within the LDF framework could be insufficient, in view of
the multiple projects it will be required to carry out simultaneously. This will be mitigated by
establishing a TST to be integrated within the LDF institutional framework during the course
of project implementation.

4.5.3. Weak financial management and procurement capacities of DAs: This risk will be
mitigated with the roll—out of IFMIS to DAs and the proposed training of DA staff in
financial management, procurement and accounting under the World Bank-funded MASAF
III APL II Project. Ongoing Public Finance Management reforms (Bank Group will be
supporting such reforms through its Budget Support operations) and other initiatives such as
employing retired staff of the Accountant General’s Department to help DAs are bearing
some fruits. Internal audit functions at DAs will be strengthened under the MASAF III APL
II Project to reduce the fiduciary risks of the project.

4.6. Knowledge Building

The project in close collaboration with the World Bank-funded MASAF III APL II
project will jointly support knowledge building initiatives to create awareness about the LDF
and promote transparency and accountability at all levels. Major communication objectives
will be to: (i) raise awareness and understanding of stakeholders on key issues (such as rules
of access to available resources for sub—projects, LDF issues, safeguards, transparency, etc.)
at different levels including communities, Local Government, and sector ministries; (ii)
advocate and promote accountability (i.e., on the role of Local Govt./LAs; promote
transparency by engaging CBOs and NGOs, media, etc.); (iii) facilitate organisational
learning and knowledge sharing within and outside the government; and (iv) build
communication capacity in support of project implementation.

14
