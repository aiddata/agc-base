1 .0 Project Background

The NGO Gender Co-ordination network NGOGCN was initiated in 1998 out of a
felt need by both Government ( now Ministry of Women and Child Development
(MWCD) and donors (UNDP) to strengthen the capacity of Non Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) to actively promote gender equality in the country. The
network was formed with the key purpose of coordinating member civil society

response to gender disparities and violence through the following layers of
attention:

1.1 Facilitating information flow among NGOs and with other stakeholders:
NGOGCN through its secretariat acts as a nerve centre for coordinating civil
society response and processes in furthering gender equality issues. With its
permanent committees, NGOGCN links with different actors and takes strategic
involvement in diverse issues to promote gender equality.

1.2 Initiating capacity building: This is done through targeted assessment of
the needs of its membership to ensure key gaps in gender contexts are
identified and proper mechanisms such as thematic trainings, resource and

organisational support is proffered to its members so that they are responsive
to emerging gender issues.

1.3 Spearheading advocacy and lobbying activities: NGOGCN brings to fore
the representative voices of its membership in national processes and national
interest issues such as engaging government and other stakeholders on policy
and legislative matters to ensure attention to gender concerns mirrors through
the fabric of all policy and legislative domain. NGOGCN furthers its cause by
proactively responding to inherent cultural practices and traditions militate
against gender equalities and perpetrate violence by propagating means of
changing them through policy, statutory reforms and change of local responses.

1.4 Harmonising the commemoration of national and international events
and represent the NGO sector in all gender stakeholder meetings and
forums: NGOGCN takes steps and interest in featuring on the international
arena through strategic representation in meetings and forums and
commemoration of international days at national level as a means to promote
its cause of fighting gender inequalities and violence. The international events
also offer a learning platform for NGOGCN and act as a window of its
recognition in both regional and international issues.

The initial 2002 NGOGCN Strategic plan that was reviewed in 2004 has a special
focus on four thematic areas that immediately transformed into taskforces
chaired by some Board members; however, these taskforces have changed now
to Permanent Committees due to the changing environment in regard to the
NGOGCN work in Malawi. These have changed as follows: From;

1. Domestic Violence Bill to Gender related Laws Committee

2. Women in politics and Decision Making has remained the same
3. Child Rights has also remained the same
4. Gender based Violence in the workplace is just Gender Based Violence

The Strategic Plan that was reviewed in 2004 with support from CIDA Gender
Equality Support Project (ClDA-GESP) gave another life span of two years. In
view of its expiring, another review process of the Strategic Plan has already
been initiated. NGOGCN intends to review its Strategic Plan and give it a long
running life to ensure a visionary focus and allow for adequate time span of
implementation of its Strategic picture. As such it envisages that the reviewed
Strategic Plan will be given a 5 year implementation period and this ties in
quite well with the work NGOGCN intends to implement under this Programme
Support Document Phase Two. While the review is not envisaged to radically
depart from the current focus, it is expected that the new SP will give the
network a manoeuvring framework for long term planning and sustainability
focus. What is expected to change is the reconstruction of its internal systems
(secretariat level) and clear-cut identification of emerging parameters and
advocacy issues with regard to policy and law reform and a sound but critical
analysis of inherent cultural and social norms that support inequalities and
violence. The SP shall redefine NGOGCN’s strategic approach buy developing
clear goals and objectives in an issue-based context and lining up of activities
to spur achievements with clear budgetary forecasts.

The network has fully participated in the development of the National Gender
programme, which was launched in December 2004; in this programme the
NGOGCN is a key stakeholder in terms of complementary efforts to ensure that
the programme has diverse support and also monitor the programme processes
to ensure that it does not lose focus. Recent reviews have revealed that the
national Gender programme has stalled in some respects. It endows on
NGOGCN to revitalise its complementary role and ensure that it supports
government, particularly Ministry of Women and Child Development, to
dialogue with development partners and other stakeholders to create an
enabling structural environment for its full implementation. The role of
NGOGCN in the bigger National Gender programme picture is that of ensuring
that key parties to the programme fulfil their roles. The network shall also use
its participation in the DAGG to influence decisions and interventions that
support the full scale implementation of the National Gender programme. In
this forum, the network sees an opportunity to negotiate the full attention of
efforts towards fulfilling the needs of the National Gender Programme. The
network will therefore facilitate such processes as to ensure that actors play
their parts and assist in identifying bottlenecks and propose better
alternatives. As a network, it will engage in advocacy on policy and other
substantive frameworks to ensure that the programme goals have been
achieved. However, through its membership, NGOGCN shall endeavour to
participate in activities towards delivering programme outputs commensurate
and with close links to its Strategic Plan.

The Royal Norwegian Embassy and the Swedish Government on the National
Gender Strategy Pre-Project Phase have supported the network. This was been
in form of support for N60 GCN Board/Network meetings, Establishment of
Secretariat and a grant facility for member NGOs to carry out activities on
gender issues in their various target areas amounting to the tune of U$21,000

through an agreement (Pre -Phase Project) signed in the year 2003 between
Malawi and Norway Governments.

Apart from this initial grant, once again, the Norwegian Government has
supported the Network with another grant amounting to MK43million for
various activities including a response fund for members of the Network.

Currently, the Network is also being supported by HIVOS with a grant
amounting to 60,000 Euros, to run for a period of 2 years. This grant is mostly
supporting Policy development i.e. Strategic Plan and Gender and HIV Policy.
NGOGCN through this support from HIVOS will develop the HIV/AIDS and the
Gender Policies considering that these are emerging challenges amongst all
institutions. Member institutions cannot stand out challenging national policy
frameworks when internal institutional policies do not exist. The Strategic Plan
will be reviewed to give it a longer running span (5 years ) and focus on
emerging Gender issues with a detailed costed response/action plan. Within
that, short term and long term targets shall be defined with clear set

milestones. A mid-term SP assessment shall be factored in to ensure
appropriate shift of energies.

The network’s role shall continue to be that of facilitating and supporting its
membership to act meaningfully on the ground. It provides the overall
coordinating mechanisms and a harmony of efforts for its network community.

Further support to the network has come from other Development partners i.e.
CIDA, OXFAM, and UNFPA specially to adhoc activities; especially during 16

days of activism while Gender links supported the consultation process of the
SADC Gender Protocol.

The Network has continued to participate in several gender related activities
such as commemoration of International Women’s Day, 16 Days of Activism on
Gender Based violence and other ongoing activities on gender based violence.

At macro level, the participation of the Network has been very visible in the
DAGG meetings (Formulation of the National Response to GBV and the
Prevention of the Domestic Violence Bill/Act, Review of the National Gender
Policy and National Strategy on GBV and many others). At SADC level, the
Network was also entrusted to do a national consultation on the SADC Gender

Protocol and made submissions to the SADC experts meeting held in Gaborone
between 16-18 April 2007.

3.3 Project Implementation capacities

NGO Gender Coordination Network (NGOGCN) has a number of successful
projects on its profile. These include:

 

Profiling of Aspiring Women Candidates for the 2004 Presidential and Parliamentary
Elections: The process of building the capacities and profiling of aspiring women
candidates started in 2003 in all the three Regions of Malawi. The project continued
and the NGOGCN would comfortably claim that it has contributed to the current status
of women representation in Parliament of 26 women parliamentarians from the initial
figure of 16 women against 193 seats. The project received US$50,000 from the
Norway/Sweden Basket fund and another U$50,000 from DFID through National
Democratic Institute for international Affairs (NDI).

 

 

 

 

 

Prevention of Domestic Violence Act: At this time that we have this law in place, it is
again the duty of the Network to popularise it and the Gender related Laws Committee
has already embarked on a sensitisation campaign on the same, in order to orient the
masses on the existence of such a Law. This is made possible with support from the
Royal Norwegian Embassy.

The Wills and Inheritance (Amendment) bill: The Wills and Inheritance (Amendment)
Bill was drafted by the Special Law Commission on Gender Related Laws in 2004. This
Bill substantially amends the current Wills and Inheritance Act, particularly the
provisions dealing with intestacy (where one has died without a Will). Despite this
position, and the urgency that is needed to arrest the problem of property
dispossession, to date, the amendment Bill has not been submitted to Parliament for
enactment. Consequently, people continue to dispossess widows without legal
repercussions. This is another area that the permanent committee is focusing on so
that before end of this year we can see this bill passed in Parliament. Apart from these
two, there are several other bills that have been pending for a very long time and
there have been on going consultation processes on the same. (These are: Child
Justice/ Protection Bill, National Registration Bill being spearheaded by the Child rights
Permanent Committee, Marriage/ Family and many others)

 

Constitutional Review: The NGOGCN has also been actively participating in the
ongoing review of the Republican Constitution that'is currently taking place in Malawi.
The Network has ably made submissions on the Gender gaps in the constitution as well
as the one on Women Representation in all spheres.

 

 

Gender Based Violence workplace survey: was conducted by the Gender Based
Violence in the Workplace Taskforce in 2004 revealed that women are prone to sexual,
psychological, emotional abuse due to their gender in most workplaces i.e. Hotels,

Multi national company (Chain stores like Shop rite) or even in some government
departments.

However, after the taskforce analysed the findings, it became difficult to disseminate
the findings because NDI as an initiator of the process at that time phased out in

Malawi. In November 2005 the NGOGCN got U$10,000 from HIVOS for compiling and
printing of the report.

The Grant from the Norwegian Government is again supporting the sensitisation
campaigns on the findings of the report.

 

Networking/Collaboration: NGOGCN while being a network, still believes in networking
and partnership. The NGOGCN continues to strengthen its networking efforts through
the collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of
Education, Council for Non Governmental Organisations (CONGOMA), Human Rights
Consultative Committee (HRCC), Parliamentary Women Caucus, Malawi Economic
Justice Network (MEJN), and Civil Society Coalition for Quality Basic Education, Civil
Society Agriculture Network, Malawi Local Government Association (MALGA), Land Net

 

 

 

and Pan African Civic Education Network (PACENET). The Network has also established
new partnerships with Action Aid International Malawi, Income Generating Public Works
Programme, Gender and Media in Malawi, a local chapter of the Gender and Media in
Southern Africa (GEMSA).

The networking efforts would not have been possible if it weren’t for a properly
established Secretariat. The Secretariat was established in 2005 with an Institutional
Grant from the Royal Norwegian Embassy and there has been some continued
institutional support through the Norwegian Government support to NGOGCN grant.
The establishment of the secretariat has been a milestone for the NGOGCN because it
has enabled the Network to be more effective in its operations.

 

 

 

4.0 Rationale

The Government of Malawi has ratified a number of International and Regional
conventions that deal with the elimination of discrimination and violence to
affirm its commitment. These include the Convention on the Elimination of all
forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of
the Child (CRC), and the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights. At the regional
level Malawi is signatory to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights
(ACHPR), The African Protocol relating to the Rights of Women and the SADC
Declaration on Gender and Development which includes an Addendum on the
“Prevention and Eradication of Violence against Women and Children, The
African Protocol on human rights of women and the SADC Gender Protocol
likely to be adopted in August this year. The signing of these
declarations/protocols reaffirms the commitment and political will that the
Government of Malawi has on issues of Gender equality and violence against
women.

The Malawi Constitution has devoted the whole section (Section 24) defining
the rights of women in addition to the general human rights provisions. Women
are explicitly protected against violence sexual abuse and harassment. It also
invalidates any discriminatory laws and practices. This provision goes further to
urge government and society to eliminate customs and practices that
discriminate against women.

Furthermore, Malawi recognises that violence against women is a severe
impediment to poverty reduction. The Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper has incorporated a gender and empowerment strategy that talks of the
eradication of gender based violence as a specific objective. Additionally,
Malawi developed and launched its “National Gender Policy”, which advocates
for gender equality and equity and the “National Strategy to Combat gender
Based Violence” in 2000 and 2002 respectively. Finally Malawi has again
developed the National Gender Programme that was launched in 2004. The
Malawi Growth Development Strategy has also clearly highlighted Gender as
key to Poverty reduction and general national development agendas. All these

efforts provide an enabling environment for Gender equality and the
eradication of gender-based violence

Despite all the successes highlighted above, there is still need to do more in
the area of Gender because of its deep rooted practices and historical
background.

5.0 Justification

While it is appreciated that the Network has been able to demonstrate some
level of success in its work, there is still a lot that needs to be done in the area
of gender in Malawi. Most of the support for comprehensive programmes for
networks like the NGOGCN has largely been done by the Royal Norwegian
Embassy and it has apparently become again very difficult to reach out to all
corners of society in Malawi due to limited resources. As an emerging network,
NGOGCN still relies on donor funds and the benevolence support of Norwegian
Embassy needs to continue for the network to achieve its objectives.

Secondly, the 1St support to the NGOGCN only had a response fund amounting
to MKZOmillion for one year and this was expected to be shared amongst four
thematic committees with a membership of forty one NGOs in total. This
simply meant MK5million for each thematic committee. Practically, MK5million
cannot be able to produce the results as envisaged by the network at the time
of application for such a facility.

It is expected that a three year extension of the same project would help in
changing the mindset of communities regarding gender issues. It is with this
view that the NGOGCN is once again submitting a second phase project support
document to run for the next three years (2007-2010).

6.0 Programme Purpose, goal and objectives

This second phase programme emerges from the Programme Support Document
Phase I supported by Norwegian Embassy. While maintaining the approaches
and issues as phrased in Programme Support Document for Phase 1, Phase II,
will take a more robust dimension by streamlining objectives and tightening
outputs to ensure that results can easily be accounted for. Further what will be
added to the new phase is a clear resultschain articulating the three year
programme results and dictating the measuring parameters. This will aid the
monitoring and evaluation of the programme.

6.1 Programme Goal:
The second phase programme goal with be to contribute towards the

attainment of Gender Equality in Malawi through efforts aimed at reducing
gender disparities, violence and call for policy/law reforms

10

6.2 Programme objectives:

6.2.1. Objective One: Institutional strengthening (Capacity Building) at
secretariat and membership level

0 To enhance the capacity of the secretariat and governance and
membership structures of the network in order to respond to
emerging gender equality needs;

This objective is in recognition that NGOGCN is an emerging network and
still has institutional challenges to be addressed. At the secretariat level,
there is need to strengthen the networking and collaborative capacity to
ensure that the network properly coordinate member efforts and attains
confidence and trust of its membership. This will be done though training of
secretariat staff in areas of Project management, Project proposal
development, Financial Management and accounting and Office
management. The secretariat shall be also equipped with ICT materials and
equipment and utility vehicle to aide mobility. Further, it recognises that
the membership need to develop their capacities in the strategic gender
sub-thematic and approach areas and advocacy in order to build the
required technical competence to engage government and other actors and
develop meaning responses to promote gender equality in Malawi. To this
end membership shall be trained and supported in Advocacy and lobbying,
policy analysis, investigation, monitoring and documentation of human
rights violations, fundraising and sustainability plan and given back-stop
support in project implementation to ensure results achievement .

6.2.2. Objective Two: Information dissemination (free flow), systems
development and documentation

0 To facilitate the free flow of information on Gender and development
issues amongst its members and other actors at national and
international level.

NGOGCN shall endeavour to establish a Gender resource and information
centre to ensure that all gender information and data is obtained and stored
at a central place and accessed by its membership and also various
stakeholders. The information centre shall have linkages with other
resource centres from institutions sharing similar objectives and NGOGCN
shall join the HURlDOCS committee that has been established to coordinate
documentation of gender and human rights information/violations and is
being led by MHRRC. A website development shall be one of the key
activities. This will necessitate the expert hands of a skilled officer and

11

therefore, NGOGCN, through this programme will engage an Information
Officer to spearhead these activities. Inevitably, NGOGCN shall need to
procure ITC equipments such as video camera, digital camera, computers,
TV screen and the necessary input paraphernalia.

6.2.3 Objective three: Advocacy and lobbying for policy and legislative
changes and transformation of inherent cultural and traditional norms that
perpetrate gender inequalities

0 To influence policy and legislative changes through advocacy and
lobbying to ensure enactment of responsive legislation and policies
for promoting gender equality and transformation of cultural and
traditional norms and values that perpetrate inequalities

NGOGCN will use its structures (Permanent Committees) to carry out advocacy
and lobbying activities on specific issues of policy and legislative reform and
identify aggressive cultural and traditional norms and values and advocate for
transformation. The network is aware that the current constitutional review
process is an opportunity for the network to influence changes in the
constitutional provisals to ensure that the constitution is engendered
accordingly. This will also entail engendering all other laws as responsively as
deemed fit; a process that shall take specific and sustained advocacy and
lobbying actions with the government and the legislature and all other actors
on the scene. There shall be a dual advocacy approach; a national approach
and cultural specific approach. National approach shall be the focus on policies
and legislation such as Wills and Inheritance, Marriage and Divorce, Sexual
Offences and other bills that have a bearing on gender matters. The cultural
specific shall be the focus on specific cultural issues and in specific community
contexts. Issues will include participation of women in community activities,
access to social amenities, traditional practices such as “wife inheritance”
“kulowa kufa” and others that reduce the dignity of women. Where it concerns
work in community context, NGOGCN shall only facilitate such processes for its
network members to deal with such issues and only be able to take matters
that have a national focus.

6.2.4. Objective four: Response Fund for public awareness, public
education and legal literacy

0 To facilitate provision of general public awareness and education on
gender matters through resource provision (response fund) to
members and through other coordination and linkage mechanisms

NGOGCN is aware of its principal coordination and facilitatory role on matters

relating to public awareness and education. It is aware that an awareness and
sensitisation campaign is the responsibility of its members. At the same time it

12

recognises the enormous capacity challenge facing its members in both
technical and financial terms. The membership does not have capacity to deal
with wider awareness issues ad therefore will need to be assisted. What is also
crucial is to harmonise member efforts and enhance collaboration on awareness
and public education issues. This has the effect of reducing duplication of
interventions, enhanced synergies and comparative advantages and achieves
economy of scale. Public awareness and education campaigns shall focus on
specific issues such as the popularisation of the Prevention of Domestic
Violence Act and public awareness on other gender related laws,
commemoration of International days and campaigns against Gender-Based
violence, NGOGCN shall sustain the response fund and increase funding for sub-
grants to its permanent committees to carry out these activities.

7.0 Programme outcomes, outputs and activities

7.1. Institutional strengthening (Capacity Building) at secretariat and
membership level

7.1.1 Capacity Building at secretariat level

7.1.1.1. The overall role of the Secretariat is to promote and improve co-
ordination of the Network activities and maintenance of linkages between
the Board and its members in all regions. To best serve the interests of its
membership, and easy co-ordination, the Secretariat is based in Lilongwe due
to its centrality.

The Secretariat has now been fully established as desired by the NGOGCN
although there is still need to continue strengthening the capacity of the
network in the area of information dissemination. It has been noted with
concern that despite all the work the Network has been doing during the past
few years, all this work cannot be demonstrated anywhere because we do not
have a website that the world over can browse and appreciate what is
happening around issues of gender in Malawi. This would also have acted as a
fundraising tool for the NGOGCN. The NGOGCN is currently in the process of
establishing a website with support from HIVOS but there was no inclusion of an
information Officer in the budget, the Network therefore considers this as an
important and critical area needing support.

There is also need to build capacities of our members of staff at the secretariat
in order for them to respond to the ever growing membership needs as well as

the changing environment in Malawi, so that they are proactive and not
reactive in their work.

13

 

The secretariat as a hub and nerve centre of the Network activities again needs
proper transportation and you may wish to know that the Cars that were
purchased through the first phase of the project may not take us through for
another three years and therefore it may very necessary to add one more new
4x4 vehicle. This is in recognisance of the fact that many NGOs do not their
own cars and hence the need to have a car that can facilitate different errands
of the network and membership at large.

While there may be a clear request of the position of the Information Officer
however, it may be again important to mention that though the other positions
are already filled, the network has heavily relied on the MFA grant for their
salaries and that once this support phases out in August, it will be difficult to
sustain the five members of staff currently at the secretariat.

With the requirement of increased information sharing, maintaining a data
bank for the network as well as improving communication as another effective
strategy for networking, the NGOGCN would require all the members of staff
services time to be costed in this project so that there is some assurance of the
sustainability of their role at the secretariat. The network is still young and at
start-up stage and needs sustained support to be able to find its feed on the
gender scene. It needs fundamental building blocks and this can only be
achieved with the committed support of its partners.

This means if funds permitting, the Secretariat once again would compromise
the following personnel: -

Network Coordinator

Finance Officer

Information Officer

Administrative Assistant

Driver

Office assistant

. Guard

~99+wwe

7.1.1.2 Board, permanent Committees and Annual General Meetings: The
NGOGCN Board Members will continue to have the primary oversight
responsibility of the project ensuring its goals and objectives are complied
with, guide and monitor the performance of its managing partners, the
Independent Steering Committee. In addition, the NGOGCN Board will continue
to lead the coordination efforts within the network and with the Government,
other partners, stakeholders and donors. The NGOGCN will also to do more
/ strengthen networking & maintain discipline among members.

it is therefore important for the board to have regular timed meetings for

policy direction as well as networking meetings in order to share and discuss
new developments as they unfold.

l4

The General Assembly (GA) is the highest authority of the NGOGCN, it
therefore becomes imperative for the NGOCGN to hold annual general meetings
to discuss the future of the network and pass critical decisions for the Board to
operate effectively. This is where the leadership changes can be effected from
time to time as required by the NGOCGN Constitution.

7.1.1.3 Support to International/Regional and National Conferences and
Meetings: While CSOs have been considered to be complimenting Government's
efforts in all spheres of development agendas, however, there has been no
commitment from our governments to fund CSOs on delegations to attend most
conferences that discuss gender issues. This therefore usually leaves CSOs in a
very awkward position because they are not able to finance their
representatives on such trips whether Internationally, Regionally and nationally
to participate in these important meetings.

These could be at the Commission on the Status of Women-UN, reviews of AU
Instruments, any other meeting with a gender focus, at SADC and at national
levels. It is the desire of the NGOGCN, that participation of NGOs in such foras
be very visible if we are to take a proactive role in demanding our governments
accountability on all the commitments that are made in regard to gender
issues, but very little action has followed in that regard. If NGOs continue being
dormant and unaware of such commitments, it would be difficult to take
government to task.

It is in this view that the NGOGCN is this time around, seeking support around
this area so that we can enhance our participation in such activities and hence
contribute to effecting change in our countries.

7.1.2 Capacity Building at membership level

NGOs lack resources to build capacities of their members hence they usually do
not have the required capacity to deal with certain issues that need their
intervention. As NGOs, we are expected to demonstrate high level of capacity
but the reverse is true with most Malawian Gender/women NGOS leaders.

There is need to build the capacity of our membership in advocacy, lobbying,
project implementation, analysis of issues ,office administration and many
others as the needs arise.

NGOs continue to experience such capacity gaps due to high numbers of trained
staff that leave organisations for greener pastures because most NGOs cannot
sustain qualified members of staff. This is so because most NGOs do not have a
core budget support. This therefore entails that the NGO sector is usually
saturated with untrained staff and when they get the required capacity, they
move on to big organisations that can sustain their needs.

16

This is a positive development for the country but impacts negatively on NGOs
that keep on training and unable to sustain. To make matters worse, Malawi

government does not

support NGOs financially, the same goes for

training/ scholarship programmes that come through the Human Resource
Department of Government that are simply given to public officials with very
little regard to C50 that form part of the workforce in Malawi and deserving
the same right to Education as Public officials.

7.2 Information dissemination (free flow), systems development and
documentation

NGOGCN shall ensure the establishment of Information and Resource Centre and
facilitate free flow of information to and amongst its members and other
stakeholders. Free flow of information is one of the key roles of the network and
through this programme, NGOGCN intends to spur processes that will ensure
collation and storage of information and central zone in the secretariat. The
secretariat shall be a nerve centre of information flow and easily obtainable by
members and other stakeholders. The secretariat shall be a window on the world
of gender related data and issues. What will be is to establish a resource room
planted with ICT equipment for processing and storage of information. The
development of a website being supported by HIVOs presents an opportunity for
availing essential information for public consumption. Since the secretariat does
not have expertise in such areas, the network will employ an Information Officer
who will propel and facilitate all processes leading to establishment and running
of the information and resource centre in the secretariat. The Information Officer
shall have links with other similar institutions and to ensure trans-information
flow amongst various actors. A HURIDOCS and CD5 (compact disc system)/ ISIS will
be installed at the secretariat and some member institutions to support
documentation of data on various gender issues including Gender -Based
Violence.

7.3 Lobbying and Advocacy

The NGOCGN through the four Permanent Committees of Women in Politics and
decision making, Gender Related Laws, Gender Based Violence and Child Rights

will continue to lobby and advocate on the emerging issues of their respective
thematic areas.

The specific Permanent Committees have to request for such funds from the
Board based on a justification for the importance and relevance of such an

issue and how it will contribute to the overall desired situation of gender
equality and equity Malawi.

This kind of arrangement will again require the recipient Permanent
Committee to follow the accepted procedures for accessing such funds, in
order to be in line with the reporting principles of this grant.

The Advocacy activities will enhance the NGOGCN activities in the area of Law
reform, especially this time around when Malawi is reviewing its Constitution in
order for the Law Commission to seriously consider the NGOGCN submissions on
the gender gaps in our current constitution. There is also a burning desire from
the NGOGCN and most women organisations and well wishing Malawians to see
to it that representation of women should either be clearly stipulated in the
Constitution or haveits own Law that would take care of issues of a Quota
system, if we are to succeed and meet the newly introduced SADC agenda of
50% representation of women in all spheres of life.

7.4 Response Fund for public awareness, public education and legal literacy

7.4.1 Public awareness, education and legal literacy

NGOGCN will use its members specifically through its permanent committees to
spearhead activities aimed at addressing gender issues at national and
community level. The approach will be through public sensitisation and
awareness campaigns, radio and TV programmes and general public education.
This is in a bid to deal with inherent mentalities and attitudes and practices
that perpetrate inequalities in workplace, household and community levels.
NGOGCN shall not directly implement these activities but shall provide sub-
grants to its members through its Response Fund so that the members are able
to implement these activities across the country.

Response Fund approach: The first phase of the MFA grant enabled the
NGOGCN to create a pool of funds to be used as a grant facility for the four
thematic committees of the NGOGCN, that submit proposals aligned to the four
Network’s thematic areas. However, this grant is only running up to August
2007 and there is need for an extension of such a facility.

In order for the NGOGCN to continue acting in an independent and transparent
manner in the administration of this grant facility, an Independent Steering
Committee with a representation of one member from each thematic
Committee and two Board members and one outsider with a financial
background will be maintained. The Network Coordinator and Finance Officer
will also continue to participate as Ex-official members of this Committee as
they have done with the first phase.

The committee has been very instrumental in the whole response fund
management process; this include among others: call for proposals, appraisals,
disbursement of funds and monitoring of activities as well as reporting on the
progress made so far.

It is the wish of the NGOGCN Board, to maintain the services of this committee

if there is continued commitment in retaining some level of professionalism in
the grant facility work. However, this can only be possible if there is

21

 

consideration of resource allocation to this committee to enable them meet,
discuss the proposals and monitor the activities. This is coming as a special
request because the first grant had an oversight on this and created a big
burden on the miscellaneous budget.

The proposal assessment guidelines that were already submitted to MFA will
continue to be used by the independent project steering committee to award
grants to successful proposals in this second phase.

Unlike the first phase, when the independent project Steering Committee
(IPSC) met three times to discuss the same set of proposals due to some
changes that were recommended. This time around, the committee will still
meet three times in a year for approval of three different sets of proposals and
thereafter the Board will endorse the approval of the grants, the sub grant
project budgets once again will not exceed US50,000

After the approval and endorsement of the grants by the IPSC and the NGOGCN
Board respectively, the grantees have to sign a contractual Agreement with the
NGOGCN; this contains contractual obligations for both parties.

For better administration of funds, the NGOGCN has made it a requirement for
all Permanent Committees to identify one member of the Committee to be
Finance Manager of their specific committee, and these should be NGOs that
have a good proven financial record with latest audited accounts by
professionally recognised auditors.

8.0 Programme Management (Monitoring)

This continues to form an important ingredient of this project. The purpose will
really be to measure progress towards the delivery of outputs as well as to
guide the conduct of the project implementers. Continued acceptability of
Network interventions will therefore, rest on the continued credibility of
NGOGCN.

At the end of the project life, an evaluation will be done by the
Permanent/ Independent Steering committees; the Board will also make its own
independent monitoring and evaluation, again consistent with the defined
checklist. The same will be so with external audits into the application of
donor funds.
