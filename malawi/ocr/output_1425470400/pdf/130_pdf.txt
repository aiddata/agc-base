As part of Ireland‘s Bilateral Aid Programme ("Irish Aid"), it has been agreed to provide
€443,000 in ﬁnancial assistance to the ‘Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction Mitigation and
Preparedness Programme in Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts’, as set out in the attached
programme document.

The substantive interface (including ﬁnancial) is between the Irish Embassy, Lilongwe and the

documentation and notiﬁcations regarding the Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction
Mitigation and Preparedness Programme in Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts should be sent to
the Embassy of Ireland, Private Bag B490, Arwa House, Lilongwe 3.

The following terms and conditions governing the making of the payments prevail:

1. UNDP will ensure that the Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction Mitigation and
Preparedness Programme in Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts is carried out in
accordance with the terms of the Project Support Document, provided (a copy of which
is annexed hereto). UNDP shall use the contribution solely for the purposes of the
Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction Mitigation and Preparedness Programme in
Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts, and will apply it in the manner set out in the Project
Support Document. UNDP should also ensure that Irish Aid support is appropriately
acknowledged in all reports, studies etc. emanating from the Mainstreaming Disaster
Risk Reduction Mitigation and Preparedness Programme in Chikwawa and Nsanje
Districts.

2. (i) Payments amounting to €443,000 (the Aid Amount) will be provided to UNDP by Irish

Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts, Project Support Document (attached).

Payment of the approved grant of €443,000 will be transferred to UNDP when this
Letter of Agreement has been mutually accepted.

(ii) The value of the payment, if made in a currency other than United States dollars, shall be

determined by applying the United Nations operational rate of exchange in effect on the
date of payment. Should there be a change in the United Nations operational rate of
exchange prior to the full utilization by the UNDP of the payment, the value of the
balance of funds still held at that time will be adjusted accordingly. If, in such a case, a
loss in the value of the balance of funds is recorded, UNDP shall inform Irish Aid with a
View to determining whether any further ﬁnancing could be provided. Should such
further ﬁnancing not be available, the assistance to be provided to the programme may
be reduced, suspended or terminated by UNDP.

(iii) The contribution will be charged the following support costs:

In accordance with the decisions of UNDP's Executive Board reﬂected in its Policy on
