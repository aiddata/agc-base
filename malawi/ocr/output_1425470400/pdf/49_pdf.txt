Annex 1 DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROCUREMENT
OVERSIGHT AGENT FOR MALAWI’S HEALTH PROGRAMME OF WORK 1.

Background Information

The World Bank support to the Health SWAp finished on September 15, 2008.
Consequently, the World Bank was no longer able to provide procurement
oversight on behalf on Pool Partners. in response to this, and in line with the
Paris Declaration Principles on Aid Effectiveness, the Pool Partners agreed to
align more with the Government of Malawi’s (GoM) procedures as provided in the
2009 revised Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the Health Programme
of Work 1 (POW 1). The Health ooled Partners and GoM agreed to donor funded
procurement oversight being provided to the Office of the Director of Public
Procurement (ODPP) for the remainder of the POW 1. DFID contracted a Service
Provider (EPOS Health Management GmbH) in November 2009 to provide these
procurement oversight services. The Service Provider appointed a full time
Procurement Oversight Agent (POA), who was based at the ODPP offices.

In November 2010, the Pool Partners assessed that the existing TORs were not
being wholly respected by the COM and therefore due diligence in procurement
oversight was not being provided. In light of these concerns, the Health Pool
Partners agree to amend the TORs to clarify the duties and responsibilities of the
Service Provider and of the Service Provider’s POA.

Annual Health sector procurement audits will continue, and will cover 15% of the
contracts by value and volume issued during a given period.

These revised TORs pertain to the mandate of the POA.
Purpose

To ensure that the health sector’s procurement practice follows the Government
of Malawi Public Procurement Act 2003 and Procurement Regulations 2004 and
that procurement is done with due regard to principles of efficiency, economy and
the achievement of Value for Money.

Objectives

1. To hold executive authority for the co-approval of all health POW 1
procurement. Approval will be provided by the POA, jointly with DOFA MoH, or
such other official as MoH may designate, for all Health SWAp financed
procurement above the thresholds for the health sector procuring entities (MoH,
Central Medical Stores and MoH Medical Buying Committee) as mandated by
ODPP as at November 2009 and in accordance with the other thresholds
specified in Annex M (Procurement Arrangements) to the MoU and as per Table

 

1 in Annex M. Co-approval shall be required independent of the procurement
method.

2. To strengthen the capacity of the procuring entities falling under the remit of
MoH to produce accurate Bidding Documents which accord with the
requirements stated by ODPP on the ODPP website and to produce Bid
Evaluation Reports (BER) and Recommendations for Award of Contract without
fear or favour, which accurately and conscientiously reflect the Bids submitted by
suppliers.

3. To enhance the capacity of the staff of the MoH Internal Audit Department to
perform procurement audits so that they can identify attempts to manipulate
awards of contract in Bid Evaluation Reports and so reduce the incidence of
fraudulent practice within procuring entities within the remit of MoH.

4. To participate in appropriate working groups.

such other technical advice as is considered prudent);

(v) Assisting MoH procuring entities to resolve complaints from bidders resulting
from procurements managed by them;

(vi) Maintaining a procurement log of requests and responses for all documents
requiring prior review under these terms of reference, including dates submitted
for prior review as well as recommendations given;

Dear Mr Samute
. Forensic Audit of Health Procurement Oversight for Programme of Work 1

I refer to our meeting last week with you, the Minister of Health, and Dr.
Mwansambo, in which we discussed procurement oversight, among other issues.

Given the significance of the DFID—funded Procurement Oversight Agent’s (POA) 
observations of procurement practices in the health sector, it is critical that we 1
proceed with haste to resolve these issues. As such, the Health Pool Partners’

Headquarters have mandated an immediate forensic audit of the procurement

cases relayed in the POA’s Minute to the Director of the ODPP. This will include

review of relevant documentation in the Ministry of Health and the Office of the

Director of Public Procurement.

As I assured you and the Minister in our meeting last week, in the interest of
ensuring full objectivity, the Health Pool Partners have authorised an independent
firm to carry out this audit. The investigation will commence on Monday 13'h

. December when the auditing firm is expected to be in Lilongwe. I would be very
grateful if you could confirm that the auditing team will have full access to all
relevant documentation, and that the necessary personnel will be available to
provide assistance.

Having shared the revised Terms of Reference for the POA with you and Mr.
Mangulama earlier this week, it would also be useful to find out your position on
the POA being physically located in the Ministry of Health offices, as we strive to
ensure that procurement oversight is not stalled.

l have discussed this with the Secretary to the Treasury, and l look forward to
meeting with you on Monday next week for further discussions.

Dear Mr Samute and Mr. Mangulama
Procurement Oversight for Health Programme of Work 1

During our recent correspondence and discussions on the issue of procurement
oversight arrangements for pooled fund partners’ support to the Health SWAP, we
have all agreed on the need to make sure the scope of this arrangement is
absolutely clear. I am pleased to enclose draft revised Terms of Reference (TORs)
for the Service Provider for Procurement Oversight to the Malawi Health Pooled
Partners and the annexed TORs for the Service Provider’s Procurement Oversight
Agent for the Malawi’s Health Programme of Work 1. These have been prepared
jointly by the health pool partners.

It is of course important that we have an arrangement that makes sense for us all.
l have therefore asked my PA to set up a meeting for the pool partners with you to
discuss them. At the same meeting, we will be happy to update you on plans for
the detailed investigations into past health procurements which we plan to
undertake before Christmas. We recognise the need to move quickly, since
. funding by pool partners is suspended until these issues are resolved. We

welcome the Government's commitment to full cooperation in this investigation,
which I assure you will be objective.

Yours sincerely

DRAFT REVISED TORS FOR SERVICE PROVIDER OF PROCUREMENT
OVERSIGHT SERVICES TO THE MALAWI HEALTH POOLED PARTNERS

Background Information

The Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH) developed a six-year Programme of Work (PoW)
for the period 2004-2010. The MoH has also adopted the Sector Wide Approach

(SWAp) to health development as the overarching strategy for the implementation of the
PoW.

The priorities of the PoW revolve around the provision of the Essential Health package
as part of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). The broad objective
of the PoW is to raise the level of health status of all Malawians by reducing the
incidence of illness and the occurrence of premature deaths in the population.

Several development partners have supported the implementation of the PoW since its
inception in 2004 and these include the World Bank; the UK Department for
International Development (DFID); the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria (the Global Fund); the Kingdom of Norway; Sweden/Sida, the African
Development Bank (AfDB); German Development Corporation; UNICEF; UNFPA;
OPEC Fund and WHO, as either Pool or Discrete Funding Partners. Of these
development partners, the Pool Funding Development Partners (DPs), i.e. the World
Bank (until September 2008), DFlD; the Global Fund; the Kingdom of NonNay,
Sweden/Sida (up to and including FY 08/09), Germany (through KfW) and the Flemish
Government (FICA) have contributed their resources through a Pool fund with the
Government of Malawi (GoM).

The GoM and the Funding Partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in
2004 and agreed to use common procurement, financial management and monitoring
processes. For procurement it was agreed that World Bank procurement procedures
would be used for all contracts for Goods and Services to be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), as specified in the MoU. It was agreed that
remaining procurements would be conducted using GoM procedures. It was further
agreed in 2004 that the World Bank would oversee and supervise the SWAp’s
procurement arrangements on behalf of Pool Partners until their support to the health
sector ended on September 15‘“, 2008.

After the World Bank ceased to provide oversight it was then agreed that the Pool DPs.
in line with the Paris Declaration Principles on Aid Effectiveness and the use of Country
Systems, should use the GoM’s procurement procedures [as modified in agreement
with GoM and as set out in Annex M (2008) to the MoU] for all procurement oversight. It

1

 

was further agreed that the Office of the Director of Public Procurement (ODPP) would
assume overall responsibility for procurement oversight and supervision at the end of
the current PoW in mid-2011, and that in the medium term a Provider of Procurement
Oversight Agent Services (a Service Provider) would be hired through international
competitive bidding (ICE) to support ODPP in carrying out this oversight role, until mid-
2011. The service provider would be contracted to assist ODPP in exercising its
procurement oversight functions and in building the capacity of ODPP to take full
responsibility for the exercise of the oversight functions exclusively post—2011. It was
also agreed, as a temporary measure pending a longer-term solution, that the
procurement of specific categories of expenditure would be overseen and supervised as
follows:

 

 

Expenditure Category Institution Responsible for
Procurement Oversight and
Supervision

1. Works ODPP

 

2. Goods including Health Sector
Goods (excluding certain categories of
medical equipment and drugs and ODPP
pharmaceutical products, to be
procured through UNICEF) and
services (other than Consulting
Services)

 

3. Medical Equipment ODPP

 

4. Certain Categories of Drugs and
pharmaceutical products (GFATM- UNICEF (for six months); and then
funded supplies; Vaccines and ITNs; ODPP

and Nutrition Products (STATUS (IS ODPP now supervising this ??)
NOW?)

 

 

 

5. Consulting Services 1 ODPP

 

 

 

 

 

It was agreed that the Service Provider would work under the direction of and report to
the Director of Public Procurement.

Annual Health Sector procurement audits would continue and would cover 15% of the
contracts by value and volume issued during the given period.

 

Institutional Arrangements

Following this agreement, DFID facilitated the procurement of the Service Provider on
behalf of the GoM. Pending the outcome of the ICB procurement process, DFID
appointed an Interim Procurement Oversight Agent (IPOA) in December 2008 to assist
the ODPP in the exercise of its Health SWAp procurement oversight functions until such
time as the long-term Procurement Oversight Agent (POA) should be appointed.

The IPOA appointed in December 2008 was Messrs Charles Kendall & Partners (CKP)
working out of the firm’s Lilongwe offices. CKP provided a Senior Health Procurement
Specialist together with sufficient other resources to provide procurement oversight
' services for all the health sector procurement funded by the Health SWAp Partners.
This included the procurement of Goods, Works and Services (excluding certain
categories of goods as outlined in the table above). Messrs CKP were not located at
ODPP.

Messrs CKP’s involvement as Service Provider ended on 30th June 2009. There was
therefore a gap of some four (4) months between the departure of Messrs CKP and the
appointment of Messrs EPOS Health Management GmbH, the duly appointed winner of
the ICB procurement procedure to identify a suitable long-term Service Provider and
POA. Messrs EPOS started work based in the ODPP offices on November 4th 2009.

Messrs EPOS provided a Senior Procurement Specialist as on—site FDA and Team
Leader, a team of Technical Specialists to provide specialist Technical Assistance (TA)
and backup support from EPOS HQ in Germany. Twenty (20) days TA have been
provided to Central Medical Stores in May 2010 to develop a Pre—qualiﬁcation Bidding
Document for Suppliers based on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) tender
format. A further fifteen (15) days of TA were provided to the MoH Procurement Unit in
August and September 2010 to provide assistance in drafting Bidding Documents for

ICB and NCB procurements planned by MoH. The Senior Procurements Specialist has
now been in post for a year.

Justification for amendment to the TOR

Following recent Health Pool Funding DPs concerns over the implementation of the
TORs and the MOU, the Health Pooled DPs now propose to amend the Terms of
Reference (TOR) of the Service Provider (Messrs EPOS Health Management GmbH) in

order to achieve more effective procurement oversight than is being provided by the
current arrangements.

 

The Health Pool DPs promote the need for procurement to be effected with efficiency
and economy in the interests of achieving greater value for money.

The guiding principles of procurement using Health SWAp Partner funds are to be
efficiency and economy and the attainment of the best Value for Money possible. These
principles should always govern public procurement world-wide. Their application is
particularly required now, at this time of widespread economic and financial dislocation,
if public support for financial assistance to developing countries is to be maintained in
the countries providing development assistance to the Malawi Health SWAp.

Purpose

First, the Service Provider will have executive authority to jointly approve all
procurement financed by the Health SWAp with the Director of Finance and
Administration (DOFA) in the MoH.

Second, to strengthen the capacity of the MoH and Central Medical Stores and other
health procurement entities Procurement Units to procure strictly according to the
GoM’s Public Procurement Act 2003 and Procurement Regulations 2004 and to
enhance the capacity of the Internal Audit Department of the MoH to monitor and audit
Health Sector Procurement.

Objectives

1. The Service Provider will ensure that the designated POA and other consultants will
provide the necessary approvals for procurements and disbursements to go ahead in
cooperation with the DOFA MoH in a timely and effective manner. A written record of
each sign—off activity must be kept on file for subsequent audit.

2. The Service Provider will assist MoH in producing better quality annual procurement
plans. The procurement plan will break down large denomination single line items into
the anticipated contract packages, in consultation with MoH implementing entities, so
that there is a clearly visible cross—linkage between contracts and the procurement plan
packages to which they relate.

3. The Service Provider will provide effective capacity-building to health procurement

entities to improve the quality and accuracy of Bidding Documents and Bid Evaluation
Reports.

 

 

 

4. The Service Provider will provide training to MoH Internal Audit Staff in the detection
of fraud and attempts at manipulation in tender documents and Bid Evaluation Reports.

5. Recognizing that the oversight functions of Internal Procurement Committees (IPC)
are the first line of defence against fraud and attempts at contract award manipulation
by procuring entities, the Service Provider will provide training to lPCs associated with
MoH procuring entities in the checks that they need to make on submissions made to
them before signing off on requests for NOL to ODPP.

Scope of Services

The Service Provider will meet the purpose through the services of one full time
appointed Senior Procurement Specialist working as the Procurement Oversight Agent
(POA). The POA's TORs are attached in Annex 1. In addition, the Service Provider will

appoint consultants on discrete tasks as and when required and requested by the
DOFA and the POA.

The POA and consultants’ co-approval will be required to effect all procurement above
the financial thresholds as laid down by ODPP in November 2009 and as stated in
Table 1 of Annex M (Procurement Arrangements) to the MoU. The ODPP thresholds in
November 2009 were MK 10 million for Goods purchased by MoH itself, MK 20 million
for Goods purchased by Central Medical Stores (CMS) and MK 30 million for Goods
purchased with the authority of the MoH Medical Buying Committee (M80). The
equivalent figure for Works was MK 5 million for all three MoH procuring entities. The
ﬁgures for Consultancies vary. but are as laid down in Annex M to the MoU with
Procurement by National Consultants restricted to under USD 200,000 perjob (MK 30
million. Procurement of Consultancies estimated at above MK 30 million must be

opened to international suppliers. Co-approval will be required independent of the
procurement method used.

The Service Provider shall ensure the effective operation of oversight functions. The
Service Provider shall be responsible for providing adequate staff led by the POA.
Annex 1 TORs for the POA. The POA shall work under the general direction of and in
cooperation with the Director of Finance and Administration (DOFA) of the MoH. The
MoH will use GoM Procurement procedures with such modifications as have already
been agreed in Annex M (Procurement Arrangements) of the MoU. The Service
Provider will provide all other technical backup as required under the oversight contract.

The Service Provider will undertake supervision and monitoring missions and will
provide such technical support as may be required to assist the Senior Procurement

 

Specialist to effectively provide procurement oversight functions. Training and skills
transfer to Government Counterparts at MoH and, where indicated, to ODPP may be
made during these missions, building on that to be provided by the specialist expertise.
Training and skills transfer to ODPP will only be provided as far as it does not present
any conflict of interest with the Service Provider’s assistance to MoH.

The Service Provider will be responsible for the following (largely through the services
of the POA):

o Undertaking prior (before action is taken) review of technical, commercial and
legal aspects of procurement at all stages of the procurement cycle, to include
planning, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports (BER), recommendations for
contract award as per generally accepted procurement supervision guidelines
and in accordance with the MoU and, specifically, Annex M to the MoU;

0 Providing comments on documents submitted for prior review by MoH procuring

entities and making independent recommendations for amendment and
improvement;

- Ensuring that when documents are submitted by MoH procuring entities to ODPP
for No Objection, they have been carefully studied and corrected and that all the
papers required to accompany such submissions to ODPP for NOL by the terms
of the Public Procurement Act 2003, Procurement Regulations 2004 and the
ODPP—issued Desk Instructions for Procuring Entities have been provided with
the relevant file, in order to minimize the likelihood that ODPP will reject or delay
MoH procuring entity Requests for NOL on the basis of technicalities;

0 Providing evidence-based operational advice to MoH as required by the Case
Files encountered;

- Co—signing with DOFA MoH, or such other signatory as MoH may from time to
time, designate letters authorizing procurements duly approved by the POA to

proceed to contract award and signature and the disbursement of funds in
payment thereof;

a Providing NOL to all Health SWAp financed procurements below the thresholds
defined in the MoU and Annex M to the MoU, where such below—threshold
assessment is deemed appropriate by DOFA MoH or by a written submission
from the Pool Partners expressing concern about a particular procurement or a
particular procuring entity;

 

Building capacity of MoH Procurement Entities to prepare correct Standard
Bidding Documents (SBDs) in the format required by the ODPP website for all
NCB, ICE and RFQ Procurements that fall above the financial thresholds as
stated in Annex M of the MoU and the ODPP Table 3 (Financial Thresholds) as
at November 2009;

Building capacity of MoH Internal Audit Staff to do procurement audit and to
identify attempts to manipulate tender documents or Bid Evaluation Reports and
facilitate fraud through the appropriate use of systems and procedures for prior
and post review, through provision of formal training and informal “desk—training”
in order to transfer skills in line with the principles of cooperative working;

Assisting in the design and conduct of issues—based workshops to educate the
MoH and other procurement staff in specialized procurement and in common
problems observed from prior review processes;

Supporting MoH in resolving complaints from bidders resulting from MoH
procuring entities’ management of the procurement cycle;

Participating in Health SWAp Drugs and Medical Supplies Technical Working
Group (DMS TWG) and also in the Financial Management and Procurement
Technical Working Group (FM&P TWG) meetings and such other relevant

meetings and reviews of review missions for the Health SWAp at different levels,
as may be required;

Maintaining a Procurement Log of requests and responses for all procurement
files from MoH procuring entities requiring prior review under these terms of
reference, including dates submitted for prior review, recommendations given

and whether action was undertaken in line with the substance and form of the
recommendations.

In the event that ODPP unfairly or unreasonably either withholds the grant of
NOL from a procurement file submitted to it by the MoH Internal Procurement
Committee (IPC), or delays the issue of such NOL for more than four weeks, and
MoH is unable to resolve such a situation through dialogue and discussion within
four weeks, MoH shall call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the
Financial Management and Procurement Technical Working Group. In the event
of an extraordinary meeting all health Pool DPs will be invited.

 

0 Such an EGM must be convened within seven (7) days of its being called and at
least 50% of members must be present. Each side will provide the Members of
the FM&P TWG, plus the health Pooled DPs, with position papers and all
relevant documents a minimum of three (3) days before the date of the EGM, so
that the members of the FM&P TWG, plus health Pooled DPs, will be fully briefed
on the matters before them. Each side will present its case, either For or Against
the provision by ODPP of NOL to the MoH procurement concerned. A decision
for or against the MoH request for NOL will be put to a Vote of those members
present at the EGM. Members must be present in order to vote and must have
heard the verbal arguments presented at the meeting.

0 The decision of the FM&P TWG will be final and not subject to appeal. Any MoH

procurement activity failing to receive the support of the members of the FM&P .
TWG in such an EGM must be cancelled forthwith and a new procurement
procedure initiated.

Reporting

The Service Provider will submit the fpllowing reports to the MoH and the DFID. If no
comments are received within 5 working days, the Service Provider will fonNard the
reports to the MOF, the Financial Management and Procurement Technical Working
Group (FM&P TWG) and the Health Pool DPs:

0 Quarterly Procurement Performance Reports segregated per procuring
entity detailing the nature of the procurement undertaken, the procurement
method used, the cost (or estimated cost) of each procurement
undertaken or in progress, the status of each procurement activity, issues
for follow-up and the period taken by the Service Provider and MoH to .
address the issues and to make recommendations in line with the MoU;

0 Annual Report summarizing procurements undertaken and outlining
procurements pending or still in progress, with status report on each
pending file. The Annual Report shall also summarize what training has
been provided to which procuring entities and which staff members, lPCs
etc and assess the level of skills transfer. The Service Provider will assess
the adequacy of procurement management capacities and will make such
recommendations for improvement as are deemed fit;

0 Procurement Logs to be established and maintained by all MoH procuring
entities to record all procurements and a specific dated record of all

 

procurement files submitted to the Service Provider by MoH procuring

entities for review with details of the response made, time taken for
response, and recommendations made;

The Service Provider is already contracted to provide procurement oversight services
subject to different TOR up until October 31st 2011. There is a six-month extension
available to the employer (DFID) under the terms of the existing contract in case of
need. There will be no change in these arrangements. it is, however, envisaged that
longer term procurement oversight arrangements may need to be made for the
upcoming Malawi Health SWAp Ii, which it is planned will run from 2011 to 2015
inclusive. It is envisaged that any further contract for the provision of procurement

oversight services to the Malawi Health SWAp ll will be sourced through another
international competitive bidding procedure.

 

 

Health Pooled Partners in Malawi

Independent Audit Mission 13-24 December
Background and Outline of Scope of Work

Background

1.

The Malawi Health Sector Wide Programme of Work (POW 1) began in
July 2004 and ends in mid July 2011. The POW 1 is led by the Ministry
of Health (MoH) and supported by a number of development partners
(DPs). The UK Department for International Development (DFID), the
Flanders international Cooperation Agency (FICA), German
Development Cooperation (through KfVV) and the Royal Norwegian
Embassy provide pool funding (the health pooled partners).

The POW 1 is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
signed by most DPs and the Government of Malawi (GoM). This
includes specific requirements on procurement oversight for national
and international competitive bidding (these procurement oversight
arrangements are detailed in Annex M of the MOU). DFID Malawi has
been responsible on behalf of the health pooled partners for
contracting the procurement oversight arrangements since December
2008 and as such is considered the DP lead on procurement in the
health sector (GDC is the current overall health SWAP lead for DPs,
having recently taken over from WHO). in addition to the procurement
oversight agent, procurement audits are required annually. The last
one for FY 2008-09 was submitted in December 2009. The audit was
unqualified. The outcome of a recent financial and procurement audit
by the Global Fund is still awaited and will be taken into account by all
pooled partners (many of whom also fund the Global Fund).

The health pooled partners have recently become aware of a number
of concerns about the effectiveness of health procurement and supply
chain management in Malawi. This includes the recent (September
2010) POW 1 evaluation, which covered drug procurement and
distribution and stressed the scope for improvements in this area. The
pooled partners and the Ministry of Health had already agreed on the
benefits of further work to look at how to address these issues, as part
of the design process for the next phase of the Health SWAP (POW 2 -
which needs to be finalised, agreed and launched by July 2011 to
avoid any break in health planning and funding). More immediately,
however, the DFID-funded Service Provider’s Procurement Oversight
Agent (POA) has raised specific concerns about particularly
procurements. in particular, on November 191m 2010, the POA wrote to
the Director of the Office of Public Procurement (ODPP) detailing
specific concerns related to 17 procurement files (cases) which did not
comprehensively pass through the procurement oversight process. The
value of these cases is said to be US$151 million.

Having discussed the nature of the concerns raised by the POA which
appeared to breach the terms of the MOU, and to ensure full
information from both sides, the health pooled partners asked the
Director .of ODPP to provide his own explanation on the concerns

 

raised (Letter from Head of DF ID Malawi on behalf of pooled partners).
The Director of ODPP responded on November 23rd to each case.
Having considered all the available information, and on the guidance of
their respective head offices, the Pool Partners commissioned an
immediate Audit, to investigate the concerns raised in detail from an
objective perspective. Pooled funding partner disbursements to the
health SWAP have been suspended until these issues are resolved to
the satisfaction of each donors’ headquarter regulations.

The Pooled Partners have made considerable efforts at each stage to
communicate effectively with the Government of Malawi on these
issues. As noted above, the health pooled partners are committed to
working with the Government of Malawi to resolve these current
concerns as quickly as possible, to minimise disruption to the
implementation to the health SWAP. The investigation is therefore
being done immediately, to report back by early January. It is important
to note that, notwithstanding this investigation and the suspension of
disbursements, the terms of the MOU still stand. This means that any
procurements undertaken must still be scrutinised by the FDA.
Recognising the Director of ODPP’s concerns about the current
arrangement, and after some initial discussions with the Health
Ministry, the health pooled partners have proposed some revised
Terms of Reference for the POA, which were submitted to ODPP,
MOH and Ministry of Finance on 8th December inviting comments.

Purpose of the Audit

6.

To provide an independent audit of the 17 cases noted in the POA’s 19
November letter to the Director of ODPP. The audit shall be conducted
in accordance with international standards and examine whether any
deficiencies in internal control have taken place, particularly with
reference to the requirements set out in the MOU in particular its Annex
M and the Government of Malawi’s own procurement regulations.

Depending on the results of the initial investigation of these 17 cases,
the scope of the audit may be extended to cover further Health SWAp—
financed procurements between December 2008 and November 2010.

Objectives

8.

In line with the standard scope of audits required by the UK
Department for International Development and supported by the other
health pooled partners, the audit team is tasked in particular to:

Assess whether revealed deficiencies have led to material mis-
statements

Assess whether revealed deficiencies have led to wrongly awarded
bids

Verify compliance with contractual obligations and other relevant
legally binding obligations (tender documents etc)

Verify whether or not revealed deficiencies have materialised in corrupt
practices

 

Verify actual/potential losses due to misappropriation or fraudulent
practice
Comment on potential lessons for

current and future health
procurement management in Malawi

To carry out their audit effectively and avoid any delays, the Team will
require full and immediate access to all relevant documentation both
physical and if appropriate in electronic formats from the Government
of Malawi and its Agents or representatives that relate to the
procurement contracts. The Team will require timely and unrestricted
access to the relevant Government officials to discuss key issues
relating to the audit.

10.The Audit Team is required to deliver initial findings by the beginning of

January 2011. Next steps will be agreed depending on the outcome of
the Audit.

MEMORANDUM

DATE: Friday 19th November 2010

NUMBER: 055/10

TO: Director ODPP

COPY: Ms Gwen Hines (DFID), Hanspeter Schwar (German Embassy), Ms Unni Poulsson
(Royal Norwegian Embassy), Ms Katrien De Pauw (Flemish International Cooperation Agency)

SUBJECT: Concerns about limited Number of Procurement Files being passed to the
Procurement Oversight Agent (POA)

 

Summary: According to the terms of reference for Procurement Oversight for the Malawi
Health Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), the objective of my assignment, as Procurement
Oversight Agent (POA), is to provide procurement oversight for the Health SWAp and that I
shall work under the general direction of the Director, Ofﬁce of the Director of Public
Procurement (ODPP).

It has come to my attention that over a 22 month period, from December 2008 to date i.e. the
period covered by the DFID funded procurement oversight, that ODPP has not passed for prior
review to the POA appointed by the Health SWAp Partners procurement ﬁles which, according

'to both the letter and the spirit of Annex M (Procurement Implementation Arrangements and

Procedures for Pooled Partners) to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), should have been
passed. I thought I should draw your attention to these cases and seek your advice on how we
should proceed. .

As the total procurement value of the 17 ﬁles or cases is substantial (in excess of MK 2 billion)
and part of this funding comes from Development Partners, I have copied this memorandum to
the Health SWAp pool partners Heads of Ofﬁce.

Background: Annex M to the (MoU) between the Health Swap Partners and the Government of
Malawi (GoM) established the position of POA for procurement oversight of procurement
ﬁnanced by the Health SWAp. Initially an Interim Procurement Oversight Agent (IPOA) was
appointed to fulﬁl this function in December 2008. The IPOA was Messrs Charles Kendall &
Partners (CKP) operating out of their Lilongwe Ofﬁce. The IPOA was in post for seven months,
from December 2008 to June 30th 2009.

Following an international recruitment exercise conducted by DFID with input from the GoM,
Messrs EPOS GmbH of Bad Homburg, Germany was appointed as POA in November 2009 and
Messrs EPOS sent me to Lilongwe to take up this position on November 4th 2009.

 

Annex M of the MoU lays down ﬁnancial thresholds above which all procurement ﬁles ﬁnanced
by the Health SWAp Partners are to be passed to the POA for prior review. These ﬁnancial
thresholds are detailed in Table 1. In the right hand column it is stated that Contracts for prior
review shall be passed to the POA for review “as per ODPP Purchasing Limits applicable to
each (procuring) entity. ”

When I took up post in November 2009, my ﬁrst task was to enquire as to the purchasing limits
applicable to the procuring entities {Ministry of Health (MOI-l) and Central Medical Stores
(CMS)} which were the principal procuring entities within my remit, as stated in the Terms of
Reference for this assignment. A list of the purchasing limits authorized by ODPP for the various
procuring entities ODPP oversees was provided to the POA by the Assistant Director,
(Monitoring) at ODPP Mr Arnold Chirwa. The relevant page of this list is attached hereto. In
summary, it shows MK 10,000,000 (MK 10 million) as the designated financial threshold for
Goods Procurement at MoH, MK 20,000,000 as the designated ﬁnancial threshold for Goods at
CMS and MK 30,000,000 (MK 30 million) as the designated ﬁnancial threshold for procurement
authorized by the MoH Medical Buying Committee (MBC). For Works the designated financial
thresholds were lower, MK 5,000,000 for both Moll and CMS.

Annex M Paragraph 4 enlarged on the ﬁnancial thresholds for procurement of consultancies.
Paragraph 4 states that, where ﬁrms are concerned, GoM may send Requests for Proposal only to
National Firms, where the estimated cost ofthe consultancy is below US Dollars 200,000 (MK
30,000,000 @ MK 150 to USD 1.00) but that any procurement of consultancy by ﬁrms which
might cost above that threshold must be opened up to International Firms. (NB. In Table l to
Annex M of the MoU there are various other restrictions concerning thresholds for prior review
of other types of consultancy by individual consultants, etc, but these need not concern us here).

The key point of Table 1 attached to Annex M of the MoU is that procurement ﬁles emanating
from MoH and CMS concerning the procurement of goods above the threshold of MK 10 million
at MoH, MK 20 million at CMS and MK 30 million at MoH/CMS when sanctioned by the MBC
of MoH are to be passed to the POA for prior review.

Cases of concern in chronological order, first under the tenure of Messrs CKP ( Interim
POA) December 2008 to June 30th 2009.

A table attached to the CKP Final Report shows that in that period of seven (7) months, CKP
was passed just ﬁve (5) ﬁles for prior review, an average of less than one (1) procurement ﬁle
per month and Messrs CKP commented on this low number of procurement ﬁles.

Case 1. Drugs and Medical Supplies with protesting bidder.

 

Among the ﬁles reviewed by Messrs CKP four (4) concerned the prior review of Bidding
Documents, while only one (1) concerned a tender award and recommendation for award of
contract. This tender had been ﬁnalized prior to the appointment of Messrs CKP as IPOA and
recommendations for award of contract had been made, but the award of one Lot had been
challenged by a bidder, who claimed that its bid had been wrongly eliminated by the evaluation
committee concerned, contrary to speciﬁc terms of the Bidding Document. The Tender had been
ﬂoated by Banja la Mtsogolo, a Health Delivery Organization associated in some way with the
MoH and funded, at least in part, by the Health SWAp. The disputed award of Lot A concerned a
procurement of drugs and medical supplies and the protesting bidder was Messrs Missionpharma
of Denmark, one of the largest medical suppliers to third world countries in the world and
regular winners of contracts ﬂoated by various United Nations (UN) agencies. Missionpharma’s
protest was based on the fact that the Bid Evaluation Team had excluded their bid for Lot A on
the grounds that Missionpharma had not submitted bids for a minimum of 80% of the items
listed in that lot, when in fact Missionpharma had submitted bids for over 90% of the items in
that lot.

Messrs CKP as IPOA reviewed the Banja la Mtosogolo Bid Evaluation Report (BER) and the
Missionpharma protest and Messrs CKP upheld the Missionpharma case. Messrs CKP then
recommended to ODPP that the award of a contract to the wrongly selected Banja la Mtosogolo
awardee should be rescinded and that the contract for Lot A drugs should instead be awarded to
Missionpharma, the protesting bidder.

ODPP did not accept this recommendation. Since the Missionpharma Bid was costed at USD
553,587 and (according to the CKP Report) the “winning” bidder had quoted some USD 1.6
million (MK 240,000,000), there was a difference of some USD 1 million in the cost of these
two offers.

There are several reasons why ODPP might have chosen not to accept the recommendation made
by Messrs CKP as IPOA. It is quite possible that the bidder awarded the contract by 'Banja la
Mtsogolo had already received a “Notiﬁcation of Award of Contract”. If Banja la Mtsogolo used
the Standard Bidding Document (SBD) for Goods downloadable from the ODPP website, then
any such Notiﬁcation of Award of Contract would have constituted a Binding Contract,
according to the Instructions to Bidders (See ITB 43.2). {The recent case involving the award by
Central Medical Stores (CMS) of the Male Latex Condoms contract to two bidders, Messrs GST
Corporation of India and Messrs Alitom of Hong Kong, is clearly relevant here}. In such a case,
it is quite possible that ODPP was unable to reverse this contract award.

There are two cases on the ODPP Ministry of Health File, however, which suggest that requests
for prior review of Bidding Documents and then the resulting Bid Evaluation Reports (BER)
concerning other procurements, which were passed for No Objection to ODPP by MoH Internal
Procurement Committee IPC, were not then passed across to Messrs CKP as IPOA.

Case 2. Restricted Tender for Procurement of Medical Equipment February 2009

On 23rd February 2009 MoH IPC requested ODPP’s NOL for the use of Restricted Tendering as
the Procurement Method for a procurement of a list of medical equipment estimated to cost MK
305,000,000 (MK 305 million). This procurement featured in the Mott’s 2008/2009 Financial
Year Procurement Plan but the Procurement Method was stated to be by International
Competitive Bidding (ICB).

Under the terms of Annex M of the MoU the MoH Annual Procurement Plan requires the
concurrence of the Health SWAp Partners. Any change in the agreed Procurement Method from
ICB (which allows maximum competition by opening a tender to any qualiﬁed supplier
worldwide) to Restricted Tendering (which, as its name implies, necessarily involves a

diminution of competition), requires the prior approval of the Health SWAp Pool Fund Partners
(see Annex M Paragraph 9.2).

Although use of Restricted Tendering is stated in the GoM Procurement Regulations 2004 to be
at the discretion of the Director ODPP, who must be asked for his NOL whenever a Procuring
Entity (PE) wishes to use the Restricted Tendering Procurement Method, where such
procurement is ﬁnanced by the Health SWAp partners, a change in Procurement Method needs
the prior approval of the Health SWAP Pool Fund Partners also.

There is no evidence on the file that shows that such prior approval for the desired change in
Procurement Method was either sought from the Health SWAP Pool Fund Partners, or obtained.

There is also no evidence, either in Messrs CKP’s own account of their service as lPOA, or in
the ODPP MoH ﬁle, that the Bidding Document for this procurement was then submitted to
Messrs CKP for prior review, as required.

This procurement proceeded. It is assumed that MoH IPC produced a Bid Evaluation Report and
Recommendation for Award of Contract and that this BER was forwarded to ODPP for NOL.
This can, presumably, be established by reference to the Minutes of Moi-l, IPC Meetings. Some
time in May 2009, however, (when Messrs CKP were still in place as IPOA) there is evidence
that contracts were being awarded (see Submissions by Messrs lntermed, one of the Winning
Bidders in this contract, accompanying the lntermed Bid Submission for the indoor Residual
Spraying (IRS) Contract whose SBD was issued to bidders on December 14‘h 2009).

Evidence that supports the likelihood that a Bid Evaluation Report must have been submitted By
MoH IPC to ODPP for NOL, while Messrs CKP were still in place as lPOA and that contracts
were then placed following the ODPP’s grant of NOL is a letter dated July 9th 2009 on the ODPP
MoH ﬁle, which refers to the award of Lots 1,2,3,4,6,7 and 8, with a total value of MK
360,947,364.44. This letter refers back to events before the end of the CKP [POA contract.

 

 

 

This letter also states that Lot 5 automatic BP machines is to be re—quoted by the two (2) bidders,
which submitted offers, since the speciﬁcation in the original Restricted Tendering Bidding
Document was for the wrong equipment. The estimated cost of this amended Lot is not given.

While considering this procurement, it was noted that the July 9th Letter from MoH to OD‘PP
referred to above states that Lot 7 is to be awarded to Messrs Premiumway of the United
Kingdom (a regular supplier to Malawi’s MoH and CMS') at a cost of MK 139,436,89832
(approx USD 948,550). However, a MoH Contract letter issued on 24'h August 2009 to Messrs
Intermed and included in that company’s bid for the [RS Materials Tender of December 14th
2009, shows that Lot 7 was actually awarded to Messrs Intermed (not Messrs Premiumway) at a
cost of USD 997,885.08, some USD 49,334.76 higher. The difference in the two ﬁgures and the
apparent switch in award of contract from Messrs Premiumway to Messrs Intermed is not
explained.

It does appear, however, that this entire procurement of goods, with an estimated cost of well
above the MK 10,000,000 (MK 10 million) threshold for prior review, was not passed to Messrs
CKP as IPOA for prior review.

Case 3 Procurement of Motor Vehicles by MOH (February/March 2009)

On 24th March 2009 MoH IPC requested NOL from ODPP for the award of contracts for
procurement of Vehicle Ambulances, 4x4 Station-wagons, and 5-tonne trucks and the letter
states that a Bid Evaluation Report and Recommendations for Award of Contract were enclosed
with this request for NOL.

Messrs CKP made no reference to receipt for prior review of the Bidding Documents concerning
this procurement. .

It is clear from Messrs CKP’s table of the ﬁles handled between December 2008 and June 30lh
2009 that the ﬁle concerning this Request for NOL and the associated BER was not passed to
Messrs CKP as IPOA for prior review. However, with an awarded cost of MK 316,799,060.65
the value of this request for NOL was well above the MK 10,000,000 threshold for Goods above
which such procurement was required to be passed to the IPOA for prior review.

Cases under the tenure of myself, the FDA (EPOS) since November 4th 2009 .

As stated above, Messrs EPOS Health Management GmbH took up the position ofPOA
on Monday November 4th 2009. I was therefore available for prior review work from November
5th, 2009. The following ﬁles were not passed to me for prior review since that date.

Case 4 Contracts for the Supply and Delivery to MoH of IT Equipment

There is a letter on the ODPP MOH File dated 20th November 2009 concerning the supply and
delivery of IT Equipment in two (2) separate procurements, one for MK 28,516,870 and the
other for MK 11,906,300.

Based on the agreed ﬁnancial threshold for goods procured by Moi-l of MK 10,000,000 (MK 10
million), the award of both of these contracts should have passed to me for prior review.

Case 5 Purchase Order by CMS Nr 1/000405 December 10th Request for Quotations (RFQ)
and December 18th (Local Purchase Order)

This procurement was noted well after the event. A copy of this LPO Nr 1/000405 was attached
as evidence of past experience of supply to the GoM in a bid submission by Messrs Sunrise
Pharmaceuticals for the large MoH Medical Equipment Tender issued to bidders in January
2010. The LPO was for goods with a total price of MK 57,660,000, which, it was noted, was
well above the CMS ﬁnancial threshold designated by ODPP for CMS of MK 20,000,000 (MK
20 Million). ODPP provided NOL for this LPO, without passing it to the POA for prior review.

N.B. Subsequent investigations showed that, at the time the RFQ was sent out on December 10th
2009 and at the time this LPO was issued on 18th December, CMS was in possession of still valid
quotations from responders to its big June 2009 Supplementary Tender for Drugs and Medical
Supplies (which CMS had evaluated and written a BER on in November 2009) and that the
prices to be paid to the supplier in this case were 93%, 115.8% and 65% higher than the prices
quoted by the lowest evaluated bidders in the BER written by CMS the previous month.

Contracts for the Supply of Various Goods and Services to MoH January 2010

On 18th January 2010 the MoH requested NOL from ODPP for the following seven (7)
procurements:

Case 6 Consultancy to undertake District Expenditure Patterns Study to be awarded to
Messrs Alliance Group at a cost of MK 11,093,400;

Case 7 Supply of 32-seater Minibus from Messrs CFAO at MK 16,278,000;

Case 8 Consultancy for the Design and Construction Supervision of National
Pharmaceutical Warehouse to Messrs Design Studio Architects at MK 36,616,420;

Case 9 Supply and Installation of three (3) Generator Sets to Messrs Barloworld at MK
16,489,319;

Case 10 Consultancy for the Design and Supervision of Construction of District
Laboratories to Messrs Kanjeere and Associates at MK $7,167,615.20;

 

Case 11 Consultancy for the Design and Construction Management of Cold Rooms and
EPI Office Block to Messrs Norman and Dawbarn at MK 27,710,647.27;

Case 12 Additional Sum of MK 36,000,000 to the original contract sum of only MK
6,000,000 to Messrs Pabu Contractors in respect of the Mzuzu Hospital Sewage Contract
(Variation);

These Requests for NOL from ODPP were all said to have been accompanied by Bid Evaluation
Reports (BER), the relevant MoH IPC Minutes, original Bidding Documents for all the tenders
concerned, the relevant newspaper advertisements and the Suppliers Bid Submissions.

None of these procurement ﬁles were passed to the POA for prior review, despite being above
the ODPP mandated thresholds. The increase by variation of MK 36,000,000 in the cost of
sewage works at Mzuzu Hospital, when the original contract was for only MK 6,000,000, was
especially noteworthy, since the financial threshold for MoH works speciﬁed by ODPP is set at
MK 5,000,000 (MK 5 Million).

Further breaches in the agreed terms of Annex M to the MoU were noted in respect of the two
Design and Construction Supervision Consultancy Contracts listed at Case 8 and Case ID above.
Both these contracts were awarded to national Malawi ﬁrms, yet both contracts are for sums in
excess ofMK 30,000,000 (MK 30 million or USD 200,000  MK 150 to USD [.00). Above this
ﬁnancial threshold, GoM is required to open the bidding to international competition according
to Paragraph 4, sub-sections (iv) and (v) of Annex M to the MoU.

Case 13 Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) Materials Tender of December 14"1 2009

The IRS Tender’s Bidding Documents were the ﬁrst SBD received by the EPOS POA from the
MoU IPC for prior review back in November 2009 and a substantial amount of work had to be
done by the POA to make them ﬁt for issue. The Bidding Document was issued to bidders on
December 14‘h 2009. Since this was a procurement by ICE, I anticipated that following Bid
Closure around the end of January 2010 and Bid Evaluation work by MoH in February, the BER
and Recommendations for award of contracts in the three (3) lots making up the procurement
would come to ODPP for prior review by myself some time towards the end of February/early
March and I made several enquiries about this ﬁle around that time.

Towards the end of March 2010, I noticed a letter from Moll on the ODPP MoH file. This letter
was dated March 9th and it requested ODPP NOL for the award of contracts for the [RS materials
tender totaling MK 249,584,184.40. The letter referred to the accompanying provision of
required tender documents: the Bidding Document, the advertisement, an Addendum to the
Bidding Document, the BER, the MoH IPC Minutes, etc.

 

A letter from ODPP to MOH dated March 15th was also noted. This notiﬁed Mol—l that the

required NOL had been granted. However the procurement ﬁles were not passed to the POA for
prior review, despite being above the ODPP mandated thresholds.

I was embarrassed by what was assumed to be an error, since I had assured DFID’s Dr Jason
Lane that I would personally review this procurement, since I had personally spent a lot of time
on the review and re—drafting of the SBD concerned with this procurement.

I therefore wrote DFID’s Dr Jason Lane a Memo (Nr 017/‘l0 of March 24th, a copy of which is

attached hereto) apologizing for what was assumed to be an unfortunate oversight. This Memo
was copied to ODPP staff, for information.

N.B. It has recently come to light, following a much delayed Post—Review of the IRS Materials
Tender Documents handed to the POA by Mr Hamilton Sosola (then PMO 3) on March 26th, that
a serious error was made by the MoH Bid Evaluation Team in the course of its evaluation of Lot
1 (Sprayers) of this tender. In a nutshell, the Mol—l evaluation team recommended for award of
contract a sprayer which had been wrongly assessed as compliant to the technical speciﬁcations.
A type 8002 sprayer nozzle was speciﬁed in the Bidding Document, but the local supplier’s
Chinese manufacturer clearly offered a Type 8008 sprayer nozzle. This nozzle is not suitable for
the application of Indoor Residual Chemicals to walls and houses. The result has been that the
MOH Malaria Control Unit’s pre-rainy season Indoor Residual Spraying campaign, which should

be going on in ﬁve (5) districts now, cannot go ahead, since the wrong sprayer equipment has
been purchased by MoH.

This situation could easily have been avoided, if the BER and Bid Submissions had been passed
to me for prior review back in early March, since the error should be immediately apparent to
anyone, who takes the trouble to check the speciﬁcations offered by the Winning Bidder’s Bid
Submission against the speciﬁcation stated in Section 6.3 Speciﬁcations and Technical
Compliance Sheet of the Bidding Document.

Case 14. Cancellation of a Contract to Supply Syringes for the Emergency Measles
Vaccination Campaign

MOH passed an Emergency Procurement of Vaccines, 0.5 ml Autodestruct Syringes and 5m]
Mixing Syringes to ODPP for review in June 2010. This emergency procurement ﬁle was passed
by ODPP to the POA, with a request that it be immediately reviewed. This request was complied
with and the ﬁle was turned around in only three hours, the same morning as it was received by
the POA. It is noted that the ﬁle was returned with the Review at 1330 hrs. The Moll
recommendations for award of contract were endorsed, with certain caveats (see Prior Review
011 ofJune 213‘).

 

However, subsequent less time—sensitive research showed that MoH might have contacted its
CMS associate about the sourcing of these materials, and particularly the syringes, since CMS
still had valid prices offered by the bidders for its June 2009 Supplementary Tender, evaluated in
November 2009, prior reviewed by the FDA in January 2010 and for which contract
arrangements were still being made in June 2010, due to delays in the contracting process, forex
shortages, etc. A check of the Lowest Evaluated Bidders for the various volumes of syringes
required by CMS in that tender showed that MoH should have been able to achieve much better
Value for Money by contacting the suppliers who had offered best prices in the CMS tender.

MoH had contacted only local Malawi suppliers. Since syringes are not manufactured in Malawi
and the local suppliers would have to source from international suppliers anyway, it would have
been just as easy (and a good deal cheaper) for MoH to have contacted the already evaluated
CMS suppliers instead. It is estimated that the cost of the syringes sourced direct from
manufacturers would have been some MK 35,000,000 less than the price paid to the local
supplier

Unfortunately, the Mombasa (Kenya)-based manufacturer which was making the syringes for the
winning local Malawi bidder, suffered an equipment failure, which required that a crucial part of
a moulding machine should be sent back to its Asian manufacturer for repair or replacement.
Therefore the Kenya supplier could not meet the delivery deadline. Since time was of the essence
in this manufacturing contract, MoH applied for cancellation of that part of the existing contract
with its local supplier, which could no longer be delivered and Moi-l also applied to ODPP for
NOL to contract with a second local Malawi supplier, Messrs lntermed, at almost two times the
price of the original contract.

It was unfortunate that the ODPP did not mention this request for cancellation to the FDA (who
had been involved in the initial review). Had ODPP done so, the FDA would have been in a
position to recommend that MoH should contact the already evaluated syringe manufacturers
from the CMS Supplementary Tender and it might have been possible to obtain rapid quotations,
(if necessary involving air—freight delivery) from those suppliers. This would have provided
better Value for Money and MoH might not have needed to “panic buy” from Messrs lntermed at
a cost of MK 84,238,400, almost double the original contract price paid to Messrs Worldwide
Pharmaceuticals and at MK 17 per unit instead of MK 8.98 per unit.

Case 15 Framework Contract for 2010/2011 Financial Year for MoH Stationery
Requirements

At the recent Finance & Procurement Technical Working Group Meeting (Tuesday 9‘h
November), MoH PU presented its Procurement Progress Report for the First Quarter of the
2010/2011 Financial Year. It was noted that this table contained a reference to a contract having
been awarded by MoH for the provision of stationery items to the ministry with a value of MK

9

88,800,050. The request to ODPP for NOL for this procurement is shown in MOI—l Procurement
Unit Files to have been made some time in July/August 2010.

This procurement is, once again, well above the ODPP mandated ﬁnancial threshold for the
procurement of Goods by MoH, which is MK 10,000,000 (MK 10 million). This procurement
ﬁle was not passed by the ODPP to the POA for prior review.

Case 16 Contract for the Supply of Hospital Linen to CMS September 20.10

In January 2010, the POA’s prior review of the CMS Supplementary Tender recommended that
the award of any contracts for the supply of Hospital Linen (Lot Xlll) by CMS should not be
approved, on the grounds of manifest unfairness to bidders. CMS failed to provide any
speciﬁcation (dimensions, fabric weight, colour etc) in its original Bidding Document issued in
June 2009 and ﬁnal corrections (colour) were not speciﬁed by CMS in an Addendum to the
Bidding Document until 13th September, a mere ten working days before the ﬁnal (and itself
much amended) date of Bid Submission, which was September 25‘h 2009. Since international, as
well as local, suppliers were required to submit samples with their bids, this amendment did not
give suppliers the necessary time to do this. ODPP accepted this recommendation of the POA
and required CMS to repeat the procurement process with this speciﬁc lot.

Much delay followed, not helped by the departure of the Deputy Director Procurement and
another Procurement Ofﬁcer at CMS on expiry of their contracts at the end of June. Some time
in July this procurement was presumably re—initiated and presumably, some kind of BER was
produced by CMS and sent across to ODPP for NOL for the recommended award/awards.

This ﬁle too was not passed to me for review. This is all the more odd, since 1 had done the prior
review of this Lot back in January 2010, which caused this repeat of this procurement of
Hospital Linen in the ﬁrst place.

I became aware of the recommendations being made for the award of this contract when you
requested my assistance in late September in drafting a letter to the Chief Secretary GoM,
justifying why it was not possible for the MoH lPC to recommend that the contract for this
hospital linen should be awarded to the local manufacturer Messrs Mapeto (DWSM), at a cost of
approximately MK 150,000,000 when an overseas supplier, Messrs Premiumway of the UK had
quoted approximately MK 50,000,000, or only 33% of the local manufacturer‘s price.

Once again, the threshold for Procurement of Goods procurement ﬁles to be passed across to the
POA was MK 10,000,000 (MK 10 million). Whether this contract was to be priced at MK
50,000,000 or at the higher local supplier rate of MK 150,000,000, this ﬁle should have been
passed, with its associated BER and MoH lPC Minutes, to the POA for prior review.

Case 17 CMS Request to use the RFQ Procurement Method and request for NOL to
Procure Drugs in an “Emergency” Procurement September 2010

When researching the background to the Hospital Linen contract at Case 16 above, I became
aware from letters on the ODPP CMS File that CMS had on September l4lh submitted to ODPP
a Request for NOL for the procurement by RFQ of drugs estimated to cost MK 424,972,392
(USD 2,833,149 @ MK 150 to USD 1.00).

Further research showed that ODPP had already granted a Conditional NOL for this request, the
only condition being that CMS should submit a list of the suppliers to whom it proposed to send
out the RFQ.{ N.B. Since the CMS request for NOL was fully costed with an item by item table,
it must be assumed that a supplier (or suppliers) had already been contacted by CMS to provide
the very quotations for which CMS was now seeking NOL to send out}.

Yet more reading {this time of the Minutes of the CMS Oversight Body the MoH Medical
Buying Committee (MBC)}, which accompanied the CMS request for NOL and were on the
CMS File, showed that the M011 MBC had speciﬁcally instructed CMS NOT to go ahead with
this procurement, on the reasonable grounds that (a) the quantities being sought by CMS were
excessive, particularly in relation to orders still outstanding due to forex constraints, but placed

with overseas suppliers as a result of the Supplementary Tender of June 2009 and (b) that CMS
had no budgeted funds for this procurement.

ODPP was therefore in the curious position of granting NOL to CMS for a procurement and a
procurement method, which CMS’s own oversight body the MoH Medical Buying Committee,
had quite speciﬁcally refused to sanction.

According to Annex M of the MoU, at MK 424,972,392 this desired procurement by MoH
should certainly have been passed to the FDA , when it was received by ODPP, since the ODPP
mandated procurement threshold for the procuring entities concerned was MK 20 million for
CMS and MK 30 million, if being submitted by the Medical Buying Committee ol’MoH.

I discovered this ﬁle quite unexpectedly, when requested to provide assistance in the drafting of
the letter to the Chief Secretary requested by yourself concerning the Hospital Linen contract
award (see above). However, subsequent research and price comparison with the prices of drugs
items evaluated in the CMS June 2009 Supplementary Tender (where many suppliers over a year
after quoting are still holding the same prices), have shown that the average price to be paid by
CMS for the drug items on the September Emergency Procurement which are common to the
drugs list in the Supplementary Tender is 136% higher than the prices quoted for the same items
in the Supplementary Tender.

In summary, please see the attached table presenting the value for each case presented above.

.‘ Director SWAp Secretariat

Dear Dr. Phoya
Preparations for possible UK support to next phase of Health SWAP

As you know, in addition to DFID’s £80 million annual bilateral aid programme managed by my office
here in Malawi, the UK through DFID provides substantial development assistance to developing
countries through multilateral organisations including the Global Fund, World Bank, Africa
Development Bank, UN and EU and through regional and centrally managed DFID programmes.

this context ,DFID ‘s headquarters has funded a consortium led by Options to undertake the

esign phase of new regional programmes to help save lives of mothers and newborns in Nigeria,
Sierra Leone ,Ethiopia , Malawi ,Ghana and Tanzania .lf funding is confirmed, the programme will
support initiatives to produce more complete data, and improve maternal and neonatal health
outcomes through more effective targeting of resources and programming. We believe this would
complement the work we are doing in partnership with you through our bilateral programme and
provide a valuable opportunity to learn lessons across countries. More detail about the proposed
programme is given in the attached note.

A small design team propose to visit Malawi from 15th to 19th November. We would be very grateful if
the team could meet with you at the beginning of their visit. The purpose of the visit would be to
introduce the project and to identify key synergies between the work of the MOH and the proposed
project. A one—hour meeting would be very much appreciated. DFID Malawi staff will be in touch
about this.
