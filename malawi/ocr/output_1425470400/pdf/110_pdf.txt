Potato Proposal (4th Draft)

1. Reduction in budget has been observed in the following budget lines:
a. Travel budget: From $74,000 to $65,000.
b. The office space: From $12,000 to $7,000.
c. Office suppliers/software: From $2,333 to $2,250

2. Field operations budget has been increased from $125,000 to $167,000. The following add-

ins to the field budget line are noted:
a. Materials for execution of farm trials/agronomic research: from $9,000 to $18,000

b. Research support and extension: From $15,000 to $29,000
c. Establishment of aeroponics at Bvumbe Research Station and its supplies: From
$10,000 to $12,000

3. Based on the above, the total direct cost has increased from $598,333 to $621,000

4. Overheard rate is charged at 20% - increased from 3116,167 to $120,750 (due to increase in
Total Direct Cost)

5. Exchange rate adjusted to 1.35 (dollar to Euro)

My observations:

1. The budget for office supplies and communications (stationery, telephone, email) should be
part of the institutional overheard charge. This means that additional $18,250 will be freed
to field activities. Based on this the field budget will increase by $60,000 from the original
budget.

2. The overheads charge at 20% will remain at $120,750. However, we need more breakdown
on this since we are already paying for the salaries of staff. A strong letter on this to be
written that the audit will look at what key institutional direct costs were incurred on this

that is part ofthe project.

OFSP (4th Draft)

Overheads amount has not changed, still 20% at $68,166.

Travel budget - Air travel increased from $7,000 to $10,000 (NOT acceptable)
Project activities budget increased (by $8,436)

Project activities, Roots and tuber Platform: From $6,000 to $10,000
Chipping machine for sweet potato: From $4,871 to $2,577

Post harvest and processing activities: from $15,000 to $16,000
Seed systems research: from $2,577 to $4,871

PP’N!‘

My Observations

1. The budget for office supplies and communications (stationery, telephone, email) should be
part of the institutional overheard charge. This means that additional $9,500 will be freed to
project activities. The utility charges and insurance ($4,500) need also to be under
overheads. in this case additional $14,500.00

2. The overheads charge at 20% will remain at $68,167. However, we need more breakdown
on this since we are already paying for the salaries of staff.

3. A strong letter on this to be written that the audit will look at what key institutional direct
costs were incurred on this that is part of the project.

Appraisal Note for 2010/11 CIP (OFSP) Proposal

1.0

Introduction

International Potato Centre (CIP) submitted a 2010/11 proposal to imple ent a Year

2 of the ’Rooting out Hunger in Malawi with Nutritious Orange—fleshed

for th
the p

eet Potato
e benefit of women and children project’. The goal of the project is to ensure
rovision of high quality, disease free primary OFSP planting material, and to

promote them in order to improve vitamin A and energy intake for at least 115,000
rural households with young children. The specific objectives of the project are to:

In the

To improve vitamin A intake for rural vulnerable groups in Central and
Southern Malawi through effective establishment of decentralized vine
multipliers and a media—based demand creation campaign.

Increase effective demand by changing the perception of sweet potato and
develop fresh root marketing chains for orange-fleshed sweet potato in the
Blantyre market and reduce fluctuations in overall sweet potato supply to the
fresh market.

Increase the productivity and quality of sweet potato in intensifying farming
systems to ensure surplus production for sale and decrease the length of the
hunger season.

Increase the capacity of DARS to produce clean, tissue culture sweet potato
plantlets, maintain primary multiplication sites, and design and conduct seed
systems and integrated crop management research.

first year, the emphasis of the project was to set up the institutional structures

and carry out various sweet potato multiplication, including technical backstopping
and training. The following key achievements from the first year were noted:

a)

c)

Partner and personnel involvement. Extension staff members of partner
organizations were trained and 10 secondary vine multiplication sites were
established for Zondeni from positively selected material at Bvumbwe
station. These were expanded to 25 trained secondary multipliers and 108
tertiary multipliers by the dry season of 2010. All of the partner
organization—CADECOM, Concern Universal (CU), and Millennium Village
Projects MVP actively participated in the project. The use of farmer
organizations also allowed partners to achieve a good gender balance in the
target communities.

Establishment of decentralized vine multipliers (DVMs). A total of 25
secondary DVMs and 108 DVMs were established. These multipliers
produced sufficient material to distribute to at least 23,000 households.
7,097 households will be subsidized to receive planting material at the
beginning of Year 2 at a fair market value.

Media-based demand creation. A community theatre group has been
contracted to help in sending messages to our target audience. A
comprehensive demand creation campaign is planned in Year 2.

d) On—farm trials. On-farm trials were very effective for achieving farmer

involvement in variety assessment. Unfortunately, the yield of variety trials
this year was low due to a combination of factors associated with project
initiation. Trials were established late and under rain-fed conditions, resulting
in yields that were lower than those typically achieved by farmers using
current practices on their own farms.

Focus for Year 2

The focus on Year 2 is to scale up the programme so that it reaches at least 23,000
households. The key focus for the year include:

3.0

a. Establish in-vitro tissue culture capacity at Bvumbwe Research Station
and expand production of primary material of OFSP variety Zondeni to 4
ha. A large stock of pathogen-tested in-vitro Zondeni will be introduced
from Nairobi to support primary multiplication to flush out the old
planting material in the field and serve as foundation seed stock. Based
on the results of the Year 1 on-farm trials, including taste tests, in the four
districts, the project will multiply new candidate OFSP varieties that will
be proposed by DARS for official release by December 2010, with a goal

of having at least 0.5 ha of primary planting material of each new variety
by November 2011.

b. Identify and train an additional 25 secondary and 108 tertiary vine
multipliers, with a goal of serving at least 23,000 vulnerable households
using subsidized vouchers by November 2011. Vine multipliers will be
allowed to sell vines to others in the community at their own price and
record those sales, once their contractual obligations to serve the
targeted vulnerable households

C. Initiate the demand creation campaign beginning in October 2010. This
campaign will be predominantly community-based theatre, performed in
each target district four times.

d. Implement research and communication activities as it relates to the
project focus i.e. on-farm trial/demonstration sites in each district, case
studies. Also, at these sites ClP will implement research/demonstration
activities on appropriate storage and processing techniques aimed at
providing a more consistent supply of fresh roots to be used for fresh
market sales over an extended marketing season, or as a source of raw
material for a somewhat extended period of processing/drying to
produce chips/flour for markets such as biscuit manufacture.

Process of Appraisal

Internal review of the first draft was done by the agriculture pillar team at
the Embassy of Ireland.

A second draft was received, but did not fully address all the comments
raised. A second internal review was done and final comments consolidated.
A review meeting between Irish Aid and Dr. Erna Putri (Sweet Potato
Specialist, CIP) too place to discuss the final consolidated comments in
details.

5.0

A final draft was then submitted by CIP addressing the comments raised

Key issues raised during the review/appraisal

Link the project to the ASWAp. There was less reference to reflect how the
programme is situated within ASWAp key focus areas.

Highlighting key achievements and lessons from Year 1 more elaborative
manner.

Reflecting post harvest storage, marketing and nutrition activities as an
important thrust of the project.

Revising the target of $40/year earnings from OFSP sales to a realistic target.
Reduction of personnel budget and giving more attention to project
operations. The salary budget was increased, including more consultant costs
by GP — need to stick to 2009/10 rates.

Budget needs to be itemised with notes

Declaring support given by other stakeholders towards sweet potato
programme in Malawi e.g. Gates Foundation, USAlD/SARRNET

Revisiting promotional material budget —which included caps, t-shirts and
zitenje. More focus to be on materials more relevant to demand creation
campaign and communicating results.

Justification for the purchase of a vehicle for the project.

More attention towards lessons learning and strengthening partnerships
among project stakeholders.

Proposal Review Assessment

The revised proposal received has integrated the key comments raised by Irish Aid.
The following insights are noted, and well integrated;

1.

Link the project to the ASWAp has been well elaborated under Table 1. The
project feeds into enhancing diversification (under food security and risk
management focus area), capacity building, research, strengthening
public/private partnerships and also on sustainable land management.

A section highlighting key achievements and lessons learnt from year 1 has
been inserted. This has informed strategic focus for year 2.

The budget has been reduced to reflect 2009/10 scales, particularly on
personnel costs. The contribution to expert consultants has been reduced.
This is meant to beef up more implementation on the ground. The budget
notes have been added and makes it easy to follow budgets to particular
items.

The target of $40/year earnings from OFSP sales to a realistic target has been
changed to €lOO/year — this is meant to reflect realism.

Storage, marketing and nutrition activities have been incorporated into the
proposal. However, there is more scope to deepen marketing intervention as
an integral part of the project.

During the review meeting, it was confirmed that the project does not
receive any additional support from Gates Foundation or USAlD/SARRNET.
Focus on the promotion materials has been on enhancing demand creation
and also capturing the results of the project. For instance, CIP plans to come
up with a video documentary which will document what has been achieved in

 

3 j Blessings Botha 30/09/2010

\

6.0

Year 1. ln addition to this, CIP will capture case studies as part of
communicating project impacts.

. The project used to borrow a car from the sister potato project. The purchase

of a dedicated vehicle for the sweet potato project is justified in order to
enhance monitoring of project activities.

Way Forward/Recommendation

I strongly recommend to support the current proposal and should go ahead
to disburse as soon as possible.

As part of implementation, there is need to continue monitoring the
programme in order to ensure that the programme is implemented as
planned.

Backstopping support will be necessary as part of programming in order to
sustain an effective demand creation campaign, and also to synergy the
programme on policy fronts.
