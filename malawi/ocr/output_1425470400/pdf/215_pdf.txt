Title : Rural Feeder Roads Programme

Summary

Transport infrastructure was identiﬁed as a focal sector in the Malawi-European Community
Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and the National Indicative Programme (NIP), chapter 6.3 signed
on 20th August 2002 and the current government (elected in May 2004) reconﬁrmed, during the
9th EDF Mid-Term Review (MTR) in October 2004 that this remains a top priority issue. The
indicative commitment (chapter 6.7) for Transport Infrastructure included an allocation of € 15 
30 million for public works rural feeder roads. The € 15 million allocation was retained at the
time of the 9th EDF MTR. The Malawi CSP also has rural development, agriculture and food
security as a focal sector and the importance of this has been emphasised by severe food
shortages in 2002/3 and again in 2005/6, the latter stimulating a declaration of national disaster
and mobilisation of the EDF B—envelope. The Rural Feeder Roads project, with the prime
objective of development of agricultural potential, is therefore highly relevant in the national
context. The logical framework for this project is given in Annex 1.

“Feeder Roads” include any road off the primary paved network that provides a link between the
primary network and the network of rural access roads. This can include secondary, tertiary,
district and undesignated roads. The Rural Feeder Road Programme supports the development of
rural agriculture through improved road access to rural growth centres. The programme adopts a
wide geographical coverage in order to provide a maximum spread of economic beneﬁts. Within
this broad national coverage, however, the programme interventions are focussed speciﬁcally on
areas with high agricultural production or high agricultural potential.

The selection of roads important in terms of providing access to regions of agricultural
productivity was made on the basis of: 1) agricultural potential assessed in the World Bank Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (ROMARP) Economic and Technical Study 2)
Agricultural production statistics for “Extension Planning Areas” from the Agricultural
Development Division of the Ministry of Agriculture 3) Social survey from the draft ROMARP
Road Reclassiﬁcation Survey, 2005, 4) NRA zone ofﬁce priority list 5) Reports on Rural
Development Diversiﬁcation and STABEX programmes. Roads were ranked according to
trading centre density. The typical feeder road layout is shown in Annex 2.

A range of technical options for intervention was considered, including routine and periodic
maintenance operations, upgrading earth to gravel, rehabilitation and regravelling of existing
gravel roads and upgrading to sealed standard. On the basis of economic analysis, road safety
considerations, sustainability and wide geographic coverage the solution chosen was:

0 Spot repairs on 2,457 km low volume roads (average EIRR 29-41%). Spot repairs include
bridge replacement, drainage works and sealing of short sections (if necessary) to maintain
year-round access. Trafﬁc volumes on almost all feeder roads considered are very low, less
than 10 vehicles per day on many roads, but with much bicycle and pedestrian trafﬁc.
Relatively low—level intervention can ensure accessibility by two—wheel drive pick—ups and
ridden (rather than pushed) bicycles even in the wet season.

0 Sealing of the 26 km 8118 secondary road Mchinji-Kawere with relatively high trafﬁc
volumes of 160—400 vehicles per day (EIRR 21%).

A capacity building action is foreseen in two critical areas in anticipation of decentralisation of

some responsibilities for network management to the local level:

0 Directors of Public Works in District Assemblies will be given refresher courses in road
maintenance.

0 A road planning system will be devised to assist local assemblies in prioritisation and local
road maps will be produced and made available to the assemblies.

 

In addition, a gender study will be carried out to establish baseline data and maximise the
potential beneﬁts of the Rural Feeder Roads Programme for women.

The cost of the Rural Feeder Roads Programme is € 15 million from the Malawi 9‘h EDF NIP
allocation. The implementation period ends on 31 December 2011 and the execution period ends
on 31 December 2013.

2. Intervention
2.1 Overall objectives

The overall objective of the programme is poverty reduction through enhanced food security and
increased smallholder income. The logical framework is given in Annex 1.

2.2 Project purpose

The project purpose is improvement in feeder road infrastructure linking areas of agricultural
potential to the main network.

2.3 Results

Result 1: 2,457 km A, B & C class* roads passable all year by 2—wheel drive pick—up and
maintainable under term-maintenance contracts.

Result 2: 26 km class A road, 8118 Mchinji-Kawere, upgraded, suitable for local trafﬁc volume
and passable all year.

Result 3: District Assemblies capacity for road planning and priciitisation improved to meet
decentralisation needs.

Result 4: Directors of Public Works trained in road engineering and maintenance.

Result 5: Gender issues and beneﬁts of feeder roads understood.

*Class A: above 150 motorised vehicles per day, Class B: 40 to 150 vpd Class C: under 40 vpd
2.4 Activities

Result 1: 2,457 km A, B & C class* roads passable all year by 2-wheel drive pick—up and
maintainable under term-maintenance contracts roads. The objective of the spot
improvement approach is to identify short sections of road in poor or impassable condition that
prevent basic access. By repairing these spots the trafﬁc is able to conﬁdently use the road in all
weather conditions. Considering the overarching objective of national food security, an
intervention covering a wide geographical area is necessary. Considering also that the feeder
roads under consideration are almost all Class C roads (very low trafﬁc), at low cost intervention
is likely to be the most suitable. It has been observed that, because of the small amount of trafﬁc,
long sections of the rural feeder road network are actually in reasonable condition, or could be
kept in reasonable condition with little maintenance, if there was improved. drainage and some
sustainable upgrading of the weak sections. Spot improvements can allow access for standard 2-
wheel drive pick—up trucks with a speed of at least 20 km/h and bicycles to be ridden with a
speed of at least 10 km/h on any section of the road all year round. Spot improvements can
therefore be a very cost effective type of sustainable intervention per kilometre of road, offering
wide impact, in terms of agricultural area beneﬁting, within the project budget.

A signiﬁcant proportion of spot improvement works will include bridge replacement and repair.
Timber bridges will be replaced with concrete and masonry structures, which are more durable
and require less maintenance. Spot gravelling will be carried out on short sections of road that
deteriorate rapidly due to poor quality in situ materials that deform under traffic loads. are highly
erodible, or are slippery when wet. The spot gravelling approach would only be applied if the
remaining sections of the road are in a stable condition and can support the trafﬁc using the road.
and if gravel meeting the speciﬁcations for wearing course is available.

Short sections of earth or gravel road may be upgraded to a low cost paved standard to reduce
the rate of deterioration (particularly on steep grades), to eliminate dust where the road passes
through a village, or where wearing course quality gravel is not available. The improvements to
be made on each of the “spot—improved” sections will be sufﬁcient to ensure that, provided the
routine maintenance operations carried out through the Roads Authority continue to be executed,
the entire section will remain open to trafﬁc throughout the year (passable by two-wheel drive
pick—ups and ridden bicycles).

The roads selected for spot improvements under this programme have been selected on the basis
of documents listed in section 1 above and are all linked to areas of “high” (category I) or
“average” (category 11) of agricultural potential. The roads are listed in Annex 3.

Result 2: 26 km class A road, $118 Mnchinji-Kawere, upgraded, suitable for local trafﬁc
volume and passable all year. The 8118 (Mchinji -— Kawere) is a special case, being
characterised by a higher category of trafﬁc density than all the other roads studied under the
Rural Feeder Roads Programme (400 vpd in the dry season). This road, which provides access
for the farms between Mchinji and Kawere to the Mchinji-Lilongwe main road, can currently
pose severe problems for trafﬁc in the wet season. On the roads for which spot repairs are
proposed (mostly 10-30 vpd), weather is assumed to be the main cause of deterioration. On the
8118, however, the inﬂuence of trafﬁc is substantial. Benefits from spot-repairs are likely to be
lost quickly and the spot repair option is not considered suitable in this case. The normal double—
lane sealed width including two sealed shoulders as deﬁned in the standard Road and Bridge
Speciﬁcation used in Malawi (double chip seal or graded gravel seal) will be adopted. The
provision of a delineated shoulder, clearly separated from the vehicle carriageway is considered
essential given the high incidence of fatalities involving bicycles and pedestrians in the country
(approximately 50% of all road fatalities). The cost estimate for rehabilitation and upgrading is
€160,000/km.

Result 3: District Assemblies capacity for road planning and prioritisation improved to
meet decentralisation needs. The objective of this component is to help the District Assemblies
to prepare for their increased role in road network management in the districts. A series of maps
will be produced and printed. The intention is to use the output from the recently completed
Road Reclassiﬁcation Study funded by the World Bank in liaison with the National Spatial Data
Centre in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Surveys for additional mapping information where
necessary. These maps will be made available to DAs, who currently lack proper maps of roads
in their districts. District and town assemblies will be made familiar with the new road
classiﬁcation numbers, which will be conﬁrmed when revisions to the Public Roads Act are
agreed. A planning and prioritisation system will be devised, which will link to the Road
Authorities central road data management system and will provide input to the annual road
programme of the Road Authority. This will be a concrete step in empowering local authorities
in management of district roads. Principles and practice of road condition surveys and trafﬁc
counting will be passed on to the DA5 to facilitate input to the annual surveys conducted by the

Roads Authority. DA staff will also be able to assist in correcting anomalies in geographical data
used for the surveys and in errors in the existing road inventory.

Result 4: Directors of Public Works trained in road engineering and maintenance.
Refresher courses will be held for Directors of Public Works (districts) and Directors of
Engineering services (urban) or their substitutes to strengthen their competence in road
management, particularly as many DPWs have a mechanical or electrical background and
requested a revision of civil engineering issues. The courses will cover design, construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance as well as management of local networks. The intention is to
organise the courses under the auspices of NCIC, with input from trainers recruited under the
Rural Feeder Roads Programme. The existing manuals on rural transport infrastructure, prepared
under the MRTTP programme, will be used as training material. The courses will include
lectures, discussions and ﬁled visits and are expected to be of approximately two weeks duration.
The number of courses will depend on logistics still to be deﬁned.

Result 5: Gender issues and benefits of feeder roads understood. Malawi has a national
gender programme (2005-2010), which examines and targets gender issues in a number of social
sectors, but not including transport. The National Transport policy does not address gender
issues in depth, but does recognise the beneﬁts of improved rural access and the need for “gender
neutral” technologies. Women constitute 70% of full-time farmers and carry out 70% of
agricultural work. Their access to markets is limited because of high. transport costs and for
cultural reasons. Agricultural extension services are dominated by male workers, who normally
work with male farmers. Women are thus denied advice and. also have limited access to
processing or value adding technology, hence producing low value crops. Head—loading, where
foot transport is necessary, is almost entirely carried out by women, whereas bicycle transport is
done almost exclusively by men. Ensuring that roads are passable in all conditions by bicycle
will potentially reduce the head—loading burden of women. Women have successfully
participated in labour—based road rehabilitation and maintenance works in Malawi (notably
through the EDF IGPWP programme. Similar female involvement will be promoted in the Rural
Feeder Roads Project. Baseline data will be established to monitor the overall impact of the
intervention on women (indicators are given in the Logical Framework, Annex 1). Guidance will
be taken from the EC Toolkit on mainstreaming gender equality in development.

2.5 Indicators

Impact and performance will be measured using indictors given in the logical framework (Annex
1). The National Roads Authority is implementing an annual condition survey of the Malawi
road network, which will include monitoring of roughness and condition of each part of the
unpaved network probably every second or third year. This will provide substantial information
on the feeder road status, including those roads included in the project.

Implementation of the works components will be measured against the performance programmes
agreed for each contractor. Monthly reports will be provided by the Supervisor’s Representative
for each construction section. Overall performance will be measured by the number of km. of
road completed.

2.6 Lessons from past experience

One lesson common to all road projects in sub—Saharan Africa is that investments in
infrastructure are not sustainable without the explicit assurance of subsequent maintenance, all,
too commonly neglected in the under funded management of road networks. The Rural Feeder
Roads project relies on continued routine maintenance under the Road Authority "temr
maintenance" plan. This has been made an accompanying measure of the Financing Agreement.

 

Experience has also shown that infrastructure projects commonly experience implementation
problems due to "poor design" or to contractor or supervising consultant blaming
implementation deﬁciencies on the design consultant. This problem will be overcome by
retaining the design consultant to carry out the supervision on the major works component.

Recent 9‘h EDF projects implemented in Malawi have demonstrated that local contractors,
particularly small ﬁrms, have poor understanding of tendering procedures and contract
administration. This can cause project failure. It is vital for the Rural Feeder Roads project that
the works to be executed are divided into lots of size to attract competent contractors of
reasonable capacity. This project is not intended as a capacity building exercise for road
contractors.

Other projects have revealed very poor capacity at local government level, including in road
network management. The Rural Feeder Roads project therefore includes a local government
capacity building component.

2.7 Linkage with other operations

The European Union is the largest single donor in the road sector in Malawi. The 81h EDF Road
Management Support Programme (8 ACP MAI 05) and the 8th EDF Lakeshore Infrastructure
Support Programme (8 ACP MAI 30) are currently supporting institutional capacity building
initiatives within both NRA and National Construction Industry Council (NCIC). Short-term
support under 9th EDF technical cooperation is reviewing structures within the MoTPW,
facilitating the initial phases of the Road Sector Programme and assisting with the establishment
of the Road Trafﬁc Authority (RTA). Other recent EDF capacity building actions in support of
transport ministries and agencies are a study of Local Government Capacity on Road
Maintenance and TA support to the buildings department of MoTPW.

The 9th Institutional Support for Transport Public Sector Bodies Programme (INSTAP) will
contribute to the development of the government’s Road Sector Programme (RSP), to integrate
policy, planning, standards, revenue, monitoring and road safety issues in the road sector.
INSTAP will also provide technical assistance to NRA for the implementation of the Rural
Feeder Roads Programme.

The 9th EDF intervention includes the €38 million Malawi Backlog Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Programme (MABARM), which is undertaking backlog maintenance, including
reseals and pavement rehabilitation, on selected bituminised roads. MABARM will also promote
the development of the Malawi contracting and consulting industry. The World Bank and Nordic
Development Fund (NDF) have recently completed a $40 million Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Programme (ROMARP), including road sector policy development, systems and
equipment for NRA; technical assistance and studies for the National Construction Industry
Council (NCIC), and road rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance.

The 9th EDF Income Generating Public Works Programme (IGPWP) uses labour intensive
act1v1ties on road rehabilitation and maintenance to increase rural income and promotes rural
self-sufﬁciency and food security through forestry club projects and small irrigation schemes.
Similarly, the World Bank sponsored Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) empowers

communities through labour-intensive reshaping of earth roads and includes strengthening of
capac1ty1n communities and local government.

 

The Infrastructure Services Project (ISP) is an initiative of the Government of Malawi and the
World Bank to improve infrastructure provision along ﬁve existing road corridors. The project
will provide support to four key infrastructure sectors: roads, energy, telecommunications and
water, on these corridors. The roads component will include improvements to Feeder Roads
linking growth centres, and capacity building for small—scale contractors and district staff.
Preparations for the ISP are being coordinated by a Project Management Unit of the Ministry of
Economic Planning and Development. A feasibility study will be undertaken in the ﬁrst half of
2006, leading to possible commencement of implementation in 2007.

The Malawi Rural Travel and Transport Programme (World Bank supported) started in 1997.
The programme is housed within the Ministry of Local Government and "Rural Development and
is part of the Rural Travel and Transport Programme of the SSATP. The goal of the MRTTP is
to “address problems of mobility and accessibility in rural areas of Malawi”, and to “contribute
to the reduction of poverty in the country”. This goal is achieved through facilitating the
implementation of rural access interventions, including district and village road maintenance and

improvement works. MRTTP supports capacrty building in the district assemblies to plan and
manage development projects, particularly in the rural transport sector.

A number of donor projects have supported capacity improvements at local government level,
including prioritisation and supervision of road maintenance. Government ofﬁcials are involved
at the local level in coordination of both IGWP and MASAIF.

In addition to transport-related and safety net programmes, donors strongly support food security
and agriculture, including land reform, assistance to food and nutrition policy development, crop
diversiﬁcation, vulnerability and malnutrition monitoring, targeted inputs to the poor, as well as
numerous farming and forestry assistance projects and small holder developments e.g. for tea,
coffee and paprika.

The preparation and feasibility work for the Rural Feeder Roads Project was carried out (under
the 9th EDF Technical Cooperation Facility) between February and April 2006 (Hydratecc
Consortium) examining the feeder roads concept, developing prioritisation methods and
intervention strategies based on agricultural, economic and demographic studies. This feasibility
work included input from the Plangroup “Assessment of Technical and Institutional Capacities
in the Local Authorities (December 2005).

2.8 Results of economic and cross—sectoral appraisal

Whilst the paved trunk road network in Malawi is generally of adequate standard to fulﬁl its
function (although with some safety deﬁciencies) the feeder road network is not. Many of the
typical feeder roads are only passable by 4—wheel drive vehicle and (pushed) bicycles during and
after the rainy season. Thus, the network of motorised public transport, either for passengers or
for goods, as well as collection and distribution points of the major traders, may not reach
beyond the major market centres along the paved trunk road network.

The trafﬁc on the average rural feeder road is therefore dominated by bicycles. These are used
to move people and goods, either in the form of public transport (bicycle taxis for goods and
passengers) or by way of a family vehicle. Motorised trafﬁc volume is in general very low, with
less than 10 vehicles per day on many roads. The advent of the bicycle, especially over the last
decade, has made rural Malawi much more mobile, thereby substantially increasing the
importance of the condition of rural roads. (Road condition is less important when trafﬁc is
limited mainly to pedestrians). Very few rural feeder roads in Malawi have a substantial amount

 

of motorised trafﬁc. These are located almost exclusively in the more densely populated areas in
the centre and the south of the country.

Routine maintenance work is currently carried out under "term—maintenance" contracts funded
from the Road Fund), which cover the whole of the classiﬁed network. intervention at the level
of routine maintenance was therefore not considered necessary under the "Rural Feeder Roads
Programme. Periodic maintenance (reconstruction or extensive reshaping) was considered to fall
into the category of spot improvements, since experience (conﬁrmed by site visits during the
feasibility study) shows that when unpaved roads become impassable, signiﬁcant work is
typically required on only 5-lO% of the length to ensure all—weather access. The remainder of the
length of the road usually only requires light reshaping, such as can be carried out under routine
maintenance.

The remaining technical options: spot improvements or upgrading, were then subject to
economic evaluation:

The economic rate of return (EIRR) for spot improvements was calculated using two sets of
beneﬁts: i) those related to improved agricultural yield resulting from reduced journey times and
costs and increased agricultural inputs ii) those arising from easier access to services: clinics,
schools etc i.e. a “consumer surplus” approach, using the Road Economic Decision Model. (RED
was developed under the WN/EC—supported Road Management Initiative for economic
evaluation of low volume roads). The rates of return were for a typical feeder road layout, based
on average input/output maize prices in Malawi. Results for the category I and category 11 cases
(cat I =high agricultural potential, cat 11 =average agricultural potential in the ROMARP study
mentioned in section 1) are given in Table l. The consumer surplus ﬁgures are exclusive of the
trafﬁc related to agriculture and the ﬁgures are therefore (nominally) additive. Input costs for the
RED calculation were based on an average ﬁgure of € 3179/km, including earthworks, drainage
and gravelling or sealing on small stretches.

Upgrading was considered for the ﬁve most highly trafﬁcked roads (classes A and B) on the
priority list and the RED model was used to establish economic rates of return for paving or

gravelling (single carriageway or double carriageway). Results for these roads are given in Table
2:

The results above in Tables 1 and 2 require interpretation. The EIRR calculation for spot repairs
is for an “average” scenario applied for a typical level of agricultural activity (category I or 11)
and assumes a 10-year lifetime. The EIRR values in Table 1 indicate that spot repair is a cost
effective form of intervention for the typical low volume feeder road (10—30 vpd). There is no
justiﬁcation for a higher level of intervention on these very low volume roads, since vehicle
numbers (and total savings on vehicle operating costs) are small and all—weather access is the
main source of beneﬁt.

The RED model calculation (20—year road lifetime assumed), following the “consumer surplus”
approach, used for the class A and B roads in Table 2 is very commonly used to compare
different investment scenarios in the nominal range 50—200 vpd. RED computes beneﬁts for
normal, generated, induced, and diverted trafﬁc, and takes into account changes in road length,
condition on the dry and wet seasons, geometry, surface type, and accident rates. It does not
include any multiplying effects in generating income, only in increased trafﬁc. Thus, there are
social beneﬁts to the community and the economy that are not included. The rate of return results
in Table 2 are not directly comparable with those in Table 1.

Table 2 suggests that paving (5m Width) the 8118, with relatively high trafﬁc volume, is
economically attractive with an estimated EIRR of 56%. The drawback of this solution is the
potential for accident due to conﬂict on a single carriageway. This risk is considered not
acceptable. The EIRR for the 8m sealed width for the 5118, however, is also sufﬁcient to justify
intervention (21%), avoids the vehicle conﬂict situation and separates motorised trafﬁc from
non—motorised. The gravelling option (the only realistic alternative for the 8118) is not
economically attractive by comparison. Upgrading of other roads (S 126, SllS/T347, 8143)
considered in Table 2 may also be economically viable, but the spot repair option can also be
considered for these. Upgrading is not appropriate for the 8107.

The preferred options, therefore, are spot improvements of 2,457 km of A, B and C class roads
of low to moderate trafﬁc levels and sealing of the SI 18 Mchinji-Kawere, 26 km.

The NRA manages the environmental impact of its road works activities through an in—house
Environmental Management Plan. NRA employs an Environmental Specialist who is responsible
for extracting potential environmental impacts from planned projects and compiling checklist
that must be considered in the design and implementation phases. For normal road works
activities it is not necessary for NRA to make a separate submission to the Ministry of
Environment. Overall, environmental impacts are expected to be minimal as road realignment is
not foreseen and much of the intervention is at relatively low level. Any damage arising from the

 

excavations, use and abandonment of gravel borrow pits will be mitigated by relaying of topsoil
and planting of vegetation, as will be speciﬁed in contract documents. The proposed
interventions will not require separate environmental impact assessments (ElAs).

Road transport routes are conduits of HIV/AIDS due to the presence of temporary construction
workers camps. These risks will be countered by awareness counselling of the work force, which
will be a standard condition of works contracts and the responsibility of the contractor.
Implementation of the HIV/AIDS activities will be through, or in close collaboration with,
NGOs and action groups with strong local experience. The INSTAP programme includes the
development of an HIV/AIDS support module covering all EDF road sector interventions.

Gender issues will be addressed as described in section 2.4 above (result 5).
3. Implementation
3.1 Physical and non-physical means

The project will be carried out through works contracts supervised by consultants recruited under
the programme. Technical assistance will be provided for the capacity building and gender
studies.

3.2 Organisation and implementation procedures

The project will be executed through decentralised management with the NAG acting as
Contracting Authority and the NRA (or new Road Authority) acting as Supervisor. The design
and supervision of the $118 Mchinji—Kawere road upgrading will be carried out by the same
consultant. Design and supervision will be procured through. a single tender (international
restricted procedure), but will be awarded in separate service contracts with the design phase
ﬁnanced from the TCF. The design of the $118 upgrade (already at the prefeasibility stage) is
expected to be relatively simple, adhering to standards and practices well established in Malawi.
The spot improvement work requires minimal design and both the design and tender dossiers
preparation will be carried out in house by the Road Authority, supported by the TA available
under INSTAP. Supervision for the spot improvement works will be performed by consultants
recruited though a service contract under this project following an international restricted tender
procedure.

As explained above, it is the intention to conduct the engineering "refresher" courses using NC'IC
facilities with trainers provided through this programme via a service contract following an
international restricted tender procedure. The INSTAP Financing Agreement already covers
support to NCIC for this type of action through a PE, which can be used to cover any additional
expenses to NCIC. The gender analysis will be conducted carried out as an additional component
of this capacity building service contract.

Works contracts will be tendered using the international open procedure.

All contracts implementing the ﬁnancing agreement must be awarded and implemented in
accordance with the General Regulations for works, supply and service contracts adopted by the
ACP-EC Council of Ministers, supplemented by the General Conditions for Contracts ﬁnanced
by EDF and the procedures and standard documents laid down and published by the Commission

for the implementation of external operations, in force at the time of the launch of the procedure
in question.

Assumptions

 

 

Overall objective

Poverty reduction through enhanced food security and increased
smallholder income

GDP per capita of poorer rural sector
of population increased

lmproved food security

Crop shortfall reduced

“integrated Household survey"

Vulnerability assessment
Ministry of Agriculture data

 

 

Purpose
lmproved feeder road infrastructure linking areas of agricultural
potential to the main network

Guaranteed all weather access
achieved for standard 2-wheel drive
vehicles (1 ton pick-up)

Bicycle access possible all—year
Women spend less time on transport
by head-loading

Annual road condition surveys
and roughness measurements
Surveys, trafﬁc counts

NRA zone ofﬁce reports
Surveys, gender study

 

 

Routine maintenance of roads carried
out through term maintenance

No exceptional ﬂuctuations in input costs
or collapse of output prices

Transport of output by bicycle or motor
vehicle increases

 

 

Results
Result 1: 2,457 km A, B & C class roads passable all year by 2-

wheel drive pick-up and maintainable under term-maintenance
contracts

 

Completion of spot improvement work
Feeder road condition fair/good

Accessibility (all roads passable by 2-
wheel drive pick-up, all weather)
Journey times reduced

Routine term-maintenance adequate
for all “spot improved“ roads
