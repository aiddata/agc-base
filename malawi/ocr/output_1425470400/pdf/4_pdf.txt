RURAL LIVELIHOODS AND ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMME (RLEEP)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Sectoral Context

1. RLEEP was originally identified during discussions between IFAD and the Government of
Malawi (GOM) during 2005. The concept emerged out of a programme to support commercialization
of smallholder farming and the support of related enterprises. Initially it was conceived as an area-
based rural development programme, modelled on the Rural Livelihoods Support Programme (RLSP)
but with a more commercial orientation. However, since identification the design has continued to
evolve. In its present form, it is essentially a commodity-oriented rural commercialization initiative
with two parallel thrusts: (i) development of value chains through participatory processes and
matching grants to Public-Private Partnership (PPPs), consortiums, and farmer groups; and (ii)
support to smallholder producers to ensure that they become better connected to the value chains
and share in the benefits.

2. Since the formation of the present Government in 2004, movement towards renewed
economic growth and poverty reduction has recorded steady progress. In September 2006, Malawi
qualified for heavily indebted poor countries debt relief, which will free up resources for
development investments. However, the country is still heavily dependent on and has been notably
unsuccessful in attracting foreign direct investment, reflecting the paucity of investment
opportunities outside agriculture and agro-industry, the risk of unreliable climate, low productivity
and high costs. Donor funds represent about 80% of the Government budget, and of the proposed
investments under the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). The key development
issues are the need for sustained economic growth through commercially-oriented investments to
overcome the constraints of limited internal market demand, under-developed entrepreneurial
capacity and the inability of most households to effectively manage risk.

Programme Rationale and Approach

3. Development interventions in Malawi over the last decade have been overwhelmingly
directed to the welfare and social aspects of food security and HIV/AIDS. This has been successful up
to a point, but has not achieved significant reduction in the very high prevalence of rural poverty. In
contrast, IFAD’s Regional Strategy emphasizes the need for smallholder farmers to better access
markets and to compete in them on more equitable terms. Such an agenda requires that
programmes that: (i) support smallholders directly (e.g. through capacity building, training and
organization development); (ii) provide mechanisms for them to better engage with markets; (iii)
support private sector intermediaries; and (iv) promote dialogue among stakeholders to generate the
policy, institutional and regulatory context for enhanced market linkages.

4. Malawi’s rural population is un-prepared for the realities of a market-led world. They struggle
to be competitive in a situation where they are not well connected to markets and lack the
knowledge, skills and financial resources to participate fully in commercial transactions. Few have
succeeded in making the transition from subsistence to small-scale semi-subsistence or semi-
commercial status. Although there has been a gradual expansion in rural commercial activity, the
shortage and high cost of capital, weak infrastructure and underdeveloped legal and regulatory

framework constrain progress. Rural market transactions are a slow and expensive process, for
which someone has to pay. The cost of these inefficiencies is borne by farmers, traders and
consumers.

5. A more market-led approach is required to improve the connectivity between smallholder
farmers and the end-users of their produce. Success depends on working with the entire value chain
through interventions which are accessible to poor households. This is an innovative approach which
does not come without risk, but the alternative of boosting agricultural productivity without
accompanying commercialization measures is not less risky. The innovative nature of the Programme
calls for risk mitigation measures to be incorporated in the design, including a three-year pilot phase
followed by a detailed review and (if necessary) reformation. Risks will also be addressed by
concentrating resources on a few commodities and locations where prospects are best.

6. As an innovative and knowledge intensive Programme, the majority of the investments will be
in soft areas such as training, capacity building, information sharing, partnership building, quality
enhancement, brokering, market development, and awareness raising. The Programme will have a
commodity rather than a geographic focus occupying the virtual space in which a commodity is
produced, stored, transported, processed and marketed. Direct engagement of the target groups will
be in focal areas located where the commodity is produced rather than the usual District-based
definition of project areas.
Targeting Strategy and Target Groups

7. Selection of priority commodities will be a key element of targeting strategy. Groundnuts and
Irish potatoes are proposed as the initial priority commodities because they are primarily grown by
smallholders, and have significant opportunities for value addition using technologies accessible to
poor households. The second element of the strategy is selection of focal areas taking into
consideration both the prevalence and severity of poverty and the importance of the target
commodities. Once the priority commodities and focal areas have been defined the Programme will
adopt an inclusive approach to ensure that the target groups enjoy the benefits of commercialization,
and that women and other disadvantaged groups have an equal opportunity to participate.

8. The principal target groups are the economically active rural poor and the transient poor who
are at risk of slipping backwards into the ranks of the core poor, but also have the ability to move out
of poverty. RLEEP will focus on households with potential to improve their participation in
commercial activities, but will also extend its outreach to some of the core poor through employment
opportunities generated by commercial development. It is expected that around 24,000 households
will participate directly, plus those who benefit from increased employment. Better off farmers and
other chain actors will also play a critical role in value chain development. However it needs to be
recognized that even "better-of ” farmers in Malawi are very poor by most standards. The
Programme will focus support on households which are actively engaged in production of the priority
commodities or have the potential to become engaged, and are located in areas where production is
concentrated.

Programme Goal, Objectives and Components

9. The Programme goal is to sustainably improve the incomes of economically active poor
rural households engaged in the production, processing and marketing of selected
agricultural commodities (crops, livestock and fisheries) by advancing their integration
with the emerging commercial sector. The Programme will have three objectives, each
corresponding to one of its three components:

 

Objective Component

 

Objective 1: Strengthen value chains and enhance the enabling Component 1: Value Chain
environment to make it more conducive to rural Commercial Mobilization and Organization
development.

 

Objective 2: Improve linkages of farmers to value chains by Component 2: Agricultural
establishing more efficient production, transport, storage, Productivity Enhancement and
processing and marketing systems for target commodities, Commercialization

thereby expanding economic activity and employment.

 

 

Objective 3: Facilitate and manage the Programme in an efficient Component 3: Programme
and effective manner. Facilitation and Management

 

 

 

10. Component 1, Value Chain Mobilization and Organization will involve: (i) participation value
chain analysis and formulation of commodity-specific action plans; and (ii) enhancement of the
enabling commercial environment for priority commodities. Specific activities will include: (i)
capacity building in value chain mapping and analysis; (ii) value chain mapping and analysis for
selected priority commodities (iii) formation of value chain networks; (iv) collaborative learning on
value chain development; (v) legislative and regulatory reform to reduce constraints to trade; and (vi)
strengthening of national institutions in agricultural commercialization.

11. Component 2: Agricultural Productivity Enhancement and Commercialization will include: (i)
engagement of value chain actors in focal areas; and (ii) the creation of an Agricultural
Commercialization Fund to provide grants to qualified applicants for supporting value chain
development. Engagement of value chain actors will be undertaken through (i) capacity building for
District and NGO personnel; (ii) publicity and awareness campaigns in focal areas; (iii) formation,
sensitization and capacity building for farmer groups; and (iv) technical and business training for input
suppliers, traders and processors.

12. Component 3: Programme Facilitation and Management will include; (i) Programme
Preparatory Facility to support start-up activities during the six months following conclusion of the
financing agreement; (ii) creating of a Programme Support Unit in the Ministry of Local Government
and Rural Development; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation.

13. Programme Phasing: Due to the innovative nature of the Programme and the need to test
and demonstrate new approaches to rural poverty reduction through commercial instruments and
PPPs, RLEEP will be implemented through a pilot phase of three years followed by an expansion
phase lasting a further five years. There will be a detailed review towards the end of the pilot phase
so that lessons learned can be used to inform adjustments to the design of the expansion phase.

Programme Costs and Financing

14. Total investment and recurrent costs, including contingencies are estimated at USD 19.2
million. The Agricultural Productivity Enhancement and Commercialization component takes up 68%
of total baseline costs, followed by the Programme Facilitation component at 20% and the Value
Chain Mobilization and Organization at 12%. The three—year pilot phase will cost USD 6.3 million,
about a third of the total.

15. IFAD will finance USD 16.7 million of the total Programme costs representing 87% of total
costs through a debt sustainability framework grant of USD 8.35 million and a highly concessional
loan of the same amount. GOM will contribute an estimated USD 0.4 million representing 2% of total
costs principally through foregone taxes and duties. The private sector and beneficiaries will
contribute around USD 2.0 million through cash and in-kind contributions to activities funded by the
ACF. The Royal Tropical Institute of the Netherlands (KIT) will support the knowledge management
aspects of the programme through co-financing amounting to USD 100 000.

Organization and Management

16. The overall coordination and management functions during the pilot phase will be performed
by a Programme Support Unit (PSU) in the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
(MLGRD), under the oversight of the Programme Steering Committee (PSC). Towards the end of the
pilot phase, options will be elaborated on discontinuing the OPSU as a stand-alone unit and
transferring its functions to the regular department of MLGRD and the implementing agencies.
Whilst MLGRD will perform a coordinating function, most activities will be implemented by other
ministries or through contracted private sector organizations and services providers. Grant funding
will also be provided to advance implementation readiness and start-up activities in the form of a
Programme Preparatory Facility (PPF). PPF funding will be used to facilitate the transition from
Programme design to implementation, avoiding the long delays that normally occur between
approval and effectiveness. PPF funding will also be used to undertake start-up activities so that
implementation can proceed without delay once loan/grant effectiveness takes place.

17. The PSU will control the disbursement of funds to implementing agencies without undertaking
direct implementation. Implementation will be done under various contractual and partnership
agreements. The PSU will oversee establishment of the Agricultural Commercialization Fund (ACF).
The PSC will have at least half of its members coming from the private sector, through the
representative industry associations (farmers, input suppliers, traders, transporters, agro-processors,
exporters etc). The PSC will be chaired by the Secretary for Rural Development in MLGRD and will
track and ensure implementation is in line with GOM policies and Programme objectives. M & E will
be a separate but integral Sub-Component of RLEEP. Detailed design of the M & E system will be
undertaken in Year 1, based on the indicators detailed in the Results Framework.

Benefits and Beneficiaries

18. The economic rationale for RLEEP hinges on: (i) improving agricultural productivity and
product quality through proven, simple and affordable technologies that will increase the marketable
surplus of target households, (ii) reducing the high transaction costs of marketing in a fragmented
smallholder system in which farmgate prices are very low relative to retail or export prices; (iii)

adding value to farm produce through simple processes such as grading packaging, packaging and
aggregation and identifying new products and markets; and (iv) addressing constraints in the enabling
environment for rural commercial activity which perpetuate the high cost/low value syndrome.

19. The primary beneficiaries will be around 24 000 rural households who participate as members
of farmer groups which are assisted to adopt improved agronomic packages and develop forward and
backward linkages to markets and input suppliers. The Programme will assist them to: (i) obtain the
inputs and technologies necessary to obtain higher yields of better quality produce; (ii) add value to
produce in situ by processes including aggregation, sorting, grading, drying, and storage; (iii) make
better commercial decisions on the basis of more timely and accurate market information; (iv) obtain
higher and more stable prices through participation in contract farming and/or out-grower
arrangements; and (v) gain access to the inputs needed for semi-commercial farming. Application of
the complete package can make the difference between subsistence agriculture and sustainably
profitable semi-commercial farming. This will also create employment opportunities for the core
poor who often depend on casual labour as an important source of livelihood.
