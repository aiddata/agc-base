1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.] 77m pmgrmnme logir'(t/ﬁ'r/mcwork

The evaluation ol‘the 3” Micro Project Programme in Malawi was performed at the end
ol‘ Ztltll and it examined the activities implemented by MPP from 'April 1999 to
November 200] under the. 8'“ European l_)evclopment liund (EDP). The ﬁnancial
proposal for the 3”! MPP was approved in January W99 and it is supposed to be
completed by September 2003.

The Programme aims are to:

(a) Consolidate and strengthen the existing self—help s1
areas.

(b) Provide a proper school environment.

(c) Make rural life more attractive. by building small feeder roads and bridges. under
live clinics. postal agencies. bore holes and shallow wells and enable communities
to acCess small capital items through micro credit schemes.

(d) Provide ﬁnancial assistance to any groups of rural or urban people engaged in self-
help projects as a means to encourage and promote the self-help spirit.

(e) Provide ﬁnance for capital items to enable groups ot‘rur
their income generating capacity.

(1) Provide small grants to rural communities who may be interested in exploring
beneﬁcial and innovative technologies.

(g) Consolidate the needs previously addressed such
pupils and safe drinking water.

(11) Provide further inﬁ‘astrueture facilities in the educ
community development sectors etc.

1.2 Relevance

> The programme is highly relevant to national policy and the main needs of society.
Malawi still ﬁnds itselfin a dramatic socio-economic situation. Poverty in Malawi is
widespread, deep and severe with 65.3 percent of the population, or roughly 6.3
million people, classiﬁed as poor.

"r The evaluation conﬁrmed that the programme objectives are consistent with the
overall objective of alleviating poverty by contributing to an improved standard of
living for the benclieiary communities and individuals.

‘r All the projects responded to real community problems despite limits on the
types ol‘intervention eligible for MPP action in the ﬁeld.

1.3 Efﬁciency

'r The progralmne operated through a Micro l’rojcct implementation Unit With a
central ofﬁce and four regional ofﬁces. The Unit was able to implement a
significant number of projects acting at nation wide level. The programme has
ofﬁcially implemented and classiﬁed L236 projects (70.5% completed by March
30(0) in the ﬁrst and second phase of the 3'“ Ml‘l’. while it is expected to complete
another 48‘) projects during the ﬁnal phase before September 2002.

if this implementation rate is respected. at the end ol'ZthZ. the progrannnc will have

implemented a total of L735 projects for a total cost of l8 million liuro. The actual

total budget allocated to projects and to operational costs will only be available next
year. but this evaluation assumes that about 16.2 million lluro will have been

reserved for ﬁeld activities and 1.8 million lL’uro for administration (following a

10% principle of total cost imposed by the Financial Agreement). The average cost

per project is about 60.000 MK. which in case of low cost inli‘astructures (below

200000 MK) is slightly high. llowevcr. considering the distribution of the projects

around the country. the distances to be covered. the number of visits in order to

monitor civil works. and the fact that the average cost of the majority of the
inﬁ‘astructtn‘es ranges around 400.000 MK. the average cost can be considered
appropriate.

‘r The adoption of the lU‘J-ti principle for the MlU costs gave mixed results. On one
hand it contributed to make MPI’ as one of the less expensive programme in the
country, on the other hand sometime it limited the efﬁciency ofthe unit in following
up the nation-wide distribution of the projects.

P The MPl’ procedures for intervention are set out in the operation manual formulated
and approved by the Steering Committee. The Committee approves the projects
proposed by the communities who submit an application form either to the district
ofﬁces or, in a few cases. to the project regional offices. The procedure is simple
and appropriate for the number of projects mentioned above, but in general it does
not ensure a direct relationship between the programme and the communities. The
projects are normally identiﬁed at the community level with eo-operation from the
district, and generally the programme starts to operate in the phase following the
needs identiﬁcation.

‘P The evaluation found that MlU management approach to the project cycle could be

improved. In general the programme monitoring and evaluation is not adequate to

the importance ofthe projects.

'r The community participates actively in the decision making process, often

involving a large portion ofthe village population; women participate in the process

and sometimes assume important roles in the community.

Local contributions normally take the form of in kind contribution (material.

unskilled labour). Unfortunately. the MlU has no updated calculation of the

contribution made by community participation to overall project cost (ﬁxed at 25%

of the total project cost). According to previous estimation the contribution

requirement is in average respected: sometime it is even more than required.
particularly where the need for material and labour is signiﬁcant as in the case of
school blocks. under-ﬁve clinics. or small buildings in general. Other types of
projects involve a civil works contractor (bore holes) or they are too expensive to be

covered with the kind (halls. health centres). Rare cases of cash contributions were
reported during the field visits. .

'2' The MIT had a very significant implementation rate, which creates the
condition for a better social and economic environment. More accurate action
should be placed in achieving better results on basic social and economic indicators.
A different approach should be introduced in the future in order to optimise
prt'rgramme cliic‘iciit:y' and eflectivcncss.

/. 4 lt’c’ffl't’ll (’s's

'l‘he programme projects are distributed all over the et'iuntry guaranteeing a balanced
distributitm of the interventions in the local districts. This choice. indicated in the
Financial Agreement. has probably sometime affected the programme effectiveness.

‘r The Financial Agreement established a programme orientation that aims to complete

a signiﬁcant number of infrastructures in order to promote a better social and
economic environment. 'l‘hercforc the programme was not directly required to
empower the communities or involve the poorest people.

'r The programme makes a positive contribution to the. quantitative aspects of

infrastructure availability. In particular, it provides a significant number of school
blocks and teachers’ houses for the education sector and bore holes for the
community development sector. Undoubtedly these infrastructures improve the
per capita ratios in particular for access to water and housing for t ‘achers.

)— At the same time, the programme provides an improved and more an active

teaching enviromncnt (in particular, better accommodation for teachers and child).
On the other hand the programme strategy directs the MPP to operate only replacing
existing temporary schools where teachers are already available. Obviously this
choice reduce impact on education indicators even if it guarantees the
functionality ofthc schools.

‘r Very positive effects were reported for the bore holes that replace traditional

water sources in all the villages where the evaluation team visited. The communities
declare that a reduction in water related diseases is the result of using the water from
the bore holes and women beneﬁt of reduced walking distances and water
fetching time.

The under—ﬁve clinics are of particular interest to the villagers. Unfortunately, the
structures are over-crowded as a consequence of limited opening hours. The centres
are frequently under—equipped which affects the quality of the services provided.
Many of the health centres built by the programme are still under construction.
Consequently, the e ’aluation team was unable to estimate their effectiveness,
but there seemed to be a high level of participation on the part of the involved
communities. l’urthcr verification should be scheduled in order to evaluate future

P The lncornc Generating Activities are an extraordinary effort to promote social

and economic development and empowerment at the community level.
lhrfor‘tunately, the results have been mixed. The lGA implemented through
financial intermediaries (H) were mainly made available to individuals or small
groups and had a positive effect on women‘s standard of living (through the
MCFW).
Unfortunately, several reallocations ofthe Ml’l’ budget favoured the implementation
of infrastructures and reduced the resources originally available to the IGA limiting
the overall extent ofthis component. '
Some of the H failed in their field activities and generally speaking the lGA
implementation rate remained below expectation. On the other hand. those Fl.
which are still operational. reported a satisfactory reimbursement rate.
The MlU was directly involved in credit scheme implementation through the l’ixed
Asset Programme (PAP). The results are less impressive than for the [GA
managed by the Fl and the reimbursement rate is lower. No additional benefits are
obtained through the direct involvement of the MlU in lGA management.
New reforestation programme should be tormulated linking tree planting project in
all ease of serious environmental impact at village level
Gender inequality and environment are crosscutting issues for the MM". The
programme favourites an indirect reduction of gender inequality by guaranteeing a
certain lchl of participation for women in the decision making process, in
project implementation (mainly as unpaid heavy labour), in infrastructure
management (as members of sevcal committees) and creating better life
conditions (bore holes). Reforestation was originally not included in the FA and it
is a secondary MPl’ activity. The aim is mainly to promote environmental
scnsitisation at village level and to reduce the negative impact of brick preparation.
Results can be improved even if a reforestation programme under the MI’P cannot
cover the national distribution of the projects appropriately. In future, it is suggested
to concentrate this action in case of few specific projects, which could affect
seriously the environment (health centres, community halls).

1.5 Impacts

 . . r
r The evaluation of the 3” MPI’ was performed ten months before the expected

conclusion of the programme (September 2002) in order to guarantee continuity
between the 3"J and the 4‘h Ml’l’. Therefore. the evaluation has taken on the aspect of
an on-going evaluation rather than a final one. Some expected impacts of the 3"d
Ml’l’ have not been achieved yet while others were the result of the two previous
programmes. The most important expected programme impact is poverty alleviation
by means of:

a) increased availability ofservices

The present evaluation mission stress

es the following conclusions
based on its analysis of the 3'd MPP:

and recommendations

>> The 3rd MPP has completed an impressive number of micro-projects. These projects
form an important indirect contribution to poverty alleviation in the country.

> The MPP should continue its ﬁght against poverty providing infrastructures and
services at the national level even if some actions would beneﬁt more from a
concentration of activities in a restricted area (for example rehabilitation of bore
holes). .

“r In order to maximise programme results, achieved- with the provision of
infrastructures, the MPP should: »

a) Address its actions towards factors directly encouraging social development (in
particular IGA to improve the living conditions of the poor).

b) Increase co-ordination with other development actors and agencies. (Io—ordination at
district level should be implemented with respect for the autonomy, independence,
policy, strategy and methodology of each involved actor.

c) Train the MIU staff in order to improve their approach to project cycle management.

d) Ensure direct involvement in the identiﬁcation of beneﬁciaries with the participation
of local communities and their traditional representatives. In particular, the
programme should promote the involvement of the poor in the implementation of
activities and sharing of programme beneﬁts.

6) Modify the MPP strategy to permit a direct relationship with local communities
ensuring direct communication with the programme beneﬁciaries.

g) Modify and optimise the MIU structure to include a new monitoring unit and a

11) Provide a more intensive and continuous evaluation system.

j) EU participation in the steering committee and in programme implementation

k) A well deﬁned accounting system should manage the

implementation and its respect in order to avoid the overlapping of new and old
MPP budgets (including eventual modiﬁcation of the current budget).
1) Modify the MIU approach to the programme, which is generally considered to have

the unlimited ﬁnancral support of the EC. There is no sense of completion to the

programme, and the overall technical and ﬁnancial management is similar to an

implementing agency instead of a real development programme, which is what the
MPP is supposed to be.

m) This new approach should lead to renew negotiations with the communities where
their real prioritie

s are identiﬁed in co-operation with the project. A clear distinction
between the completion of 3’d and the beginning of 4‘" MPPs is strongly
recommended in order to share the new programme strategy and policy at the

5) Optimise contributions from the local population including in cash contribution

priority expressed by the community is areal priority). '

t) Orient the programme toward projects sustainable at the community level,

11) Concentrate programme action on community managed projects, with the increased
and improved mediation and support of local NGOs.

With the assistance of foreign aid and investments. Malawi’s economy prospered in the
19703 growing at an average annual rate of six percent. ln general, however, thirty years
of authoritarian rule did not spur signiﬁcant and broad-based economic development.
The new government has initiated an economic reform agenda. but faces challenges on
several fronts including a rapidly growing population, a high l-llV/AIDS infection rate,
limited natural resources, high levels of inequality resulting from years of elitist

development strategies, and the corrosive effects of recurring droughts, poor resource
management and environmental degradation.

the poorest countries in the world. Malawrs economy is la

but in recent years the pace of reforms has decelerated, expenditure control has
weakened, and the prospects for agriculture have become mixed. Tobacco revenues fell
in 2000 due to slumping prices. declining yields and decreasing quality. Combined with
a sharp depreciation, lngh annual inﬂation (30 percent in February 2001) and high real
interest rates, this resulted in growth slowing to about two percent in 2000.

The evaluation team suggests that further construction of health centres should be
suspended until a detailed evaluation of their impact and sustainability is completed.
Therefore, no new implementation should be planned in the earlier phases of the 4th
MPP. As in the ease of some other types of infrastructure and projects, a period of at
least two years should be allowed for the work to be completed. Therefore, no new
projects should be launched in the ﬁfth year of the next MPP.

a) The under-five clinics respond to a very high local demand for children’s
medical services

b) The structures bring the services closer to the villages and the patients beneﬁt
ﬁ‘om reduced travel time. _

c) The under-ﬁve clinics greatly improve basic vaccination coverage. No further
details are available on their quantitative impact on local diseases.

(1) Overall impact may be seriously reduced as the under-ﬁve clinic are only open
for one day per month (as found during the ﬁeld visits).

e) The strictly limited opening hours mean that there is a high number of patients
every opening day (more than 300/day compared to the expected 100/day).

f) Clinic staff complained of a shortage of equipment and a lack of a stable supply

 of electricity. No refrigerators for vaccines are available and the clinics have no

' direct source of electricity (neither do the main health centres linked to the
clinics). V

g) In general, the team sees no direct link between the services offered at under-
ﬁve clinics and the provision of staff housing. In actual fact, the problem is
compounded because the limited days of service provided by the project sites
where the team visited do not justify permanent staff accommodation.

Remarks and suggestions
1. The MPP should Co-ordinated the action with the appropriate ministries and

authorities promoting the request for basic ﬁxed set of equipment to the under-ﬁve
‘ clinics. .

' 2. The MPP should assist with and monitor the implementation of the services. In

particular, there should be a plan for a more balanced number of opening days (at
least one day/week) as a condition also for the construction of a staff house on a
project site.

5.3 Sector 3: Communication systems

The 3rd MPP mainly favours the construction of small infrastructures, which improve
social communication at the district level. In particular. the programme has constructed
bridges (twenty-four in total), small rural roads and a postal agency which is not yet
operational. ‘ »

As in the case of other infrastructures, the projects are in good condition. The team
assessed the following preliminary impacts:

a) General improvement of access to the area where bridges were built and a
positive impact on communication systems (at both village and district levels).

b) Potential for improved access to markets and better transportation of goods. This
goal had not yet been met in Mbobwe due to the very recent construction of the
bridge. - ‘ _

c) Community states overall improved access to other sen/ices such as medical
services, ambulance services, and distances to bore holes reduced.

(1) Considering the amount of work involved, the MPP budget for bridge and road
construction is inadequate and the cost risks to be too high.

6) In general, the MPP demonstrated limited co—ordination with its own projects

'” (for example, there was no effort to achieve integrated development by

considering the existence of other micro-projects in the vicinity of the bridges)
and/or poor co-operation with other national programmes.

Remarks and suggestions

Bridge and road construction is a focal sector of EU aid to Malawi. HoWever, the MPP
has limited means and resources to sustain the proper implementation of transportation
and‘communication projects. Furthermore other programmes operate on payment basis
and more attractive for the population (poor in particular). The evaluation team suggests
that bridge and feeder road construction be discontinued and reassigned to the
appropriate national programmes (for example to the NRA programme).

5.4 Sector 4: Community development

The sector includes many types of projects in large numbers. The most important
pI‘OJCCtS are the drilling and equipment of bore holes at village and school block sites.

 

 

 

 

 

The provision of potable water (including minor interventions in water distribution and
safety) has been of great importance during the three MPP rounds. The table below
summarises projects implemented by each programme.

- Bore holes

In general, the team had a very positive impression of the bore hole sites. Only in one

case (Matete) the bore hole was not operational due to a shortage of spare parts at Nkata
Bay. '

The following are the strong points of the programme:

a) The average number of bore holes in the villages has increased in a signiﬁcant
way with programme contribution.

b) People have gradually replaced water from natural sources (rivers, streams) with
water from bore holes. which is considered cleaner and safer.

c) The use of bore holes has raised the quality of drinking water with a subsequent
reduction in water-related diseases (a fact recognised by the villagers).

d) In many cases the installation of bore holes reduced walking distances to fetch
water.

 

e) Repair and maintenance costs for the bore holes are low, and the pump is easy to
repair. The committees can handle most emergencies. ‘

f) Wherever bore holes have installed there is a noticeable increase in community
awareness and committee responsibility for managing the bore hole. The
cormnunities establish fees for repairs and maintenance, which increases the
sustainability of long term bore hole management.

The evaluation team also found some weaknesses. In particular:

a) Some communities view water supply as a free service. They do not feel
responsible for fund raising and in some cases. they were waiting for repairs.
(This is the case at the newest bore hole sites where the committee mechanism
has not yet been properly adopted.)

b) The programme does not provide intensive training for repairs and maintenance.
Some cases of improper handling of water were found.

c) The construction method used for the bore holes sometimes gives rise to water
pollution, in particular where laundry sites are too close to the water source.

d) Some committees complained of poor drainage in cases of fenced-in bore holes.

e) Some bore hole reconditioning is required in order to ensure proper operational
condition.

0 In general, the EU logo has low visibility at the bore hole sites.

g) Many other national and international progrannnes construct bore holes. The

 MPP has not yet developed a clear strategy for co-ordination with these other
programmes.

11) Generally speaking, community contribution is low in the case of bore holes.
This is mainly due to the type of infrastructure and the presence of a contractor
in the drilling and construction phases. In these cases, in kind contribution from
the community seems to be insufﬁcient.

Remarks and suggestions

Any future programmes should be planned in strict Ctr-ordination with other national
and international donors in order to avoid duplication and overlapping at the district and
village levels. MPP will maintain in future a nation-wide approach but it is
recommended to operate rotating the target districts year by year. The programme could

The long—term (1975-1995) historical annual average rate of growth has been 2.4%. The
average annual rate of growth has doubled to 5% over the most recent period (1995-
2000), led by signiﬁcant smallholder sector performance - the results of market
liberalisation, access to cash crops eSpecially tobacco, 01'0p diversiﬁcation, the absence
'ar droughts and marked yield increases in certain crops such as cassava and sweet
potatoes. '

However, this growth rate is still below the rate of 6.0% required each and every year to
reduce the absolute numbers of Malawians living in poverty and without having access
to sufﬁcient land. While the recent performance of the smallholder sector has been
marked, the levels of investment in the other productive sectors of the economy,
manufacturing and industry, and their ability to retain existing and attract domestic or
foreign direct investment, have been insufﬁcient to create substantial new formal sector
employment opportunities. Although positive growth has been recorded in these sectors,
the rate has been insufﬁcient (below the estimated 8% p.a. required) to provide any
signiﬁcant impact on the overall economic growth rate.

Over the last years Malawi has been subject to high inﬂation rate that dropped from
35% in December 2000 to 28.7% in April 2001. In an effort to reduce inﬂation and
interest rates, the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning presented a ten-point
economic plan to strengthen ﬁscal discipline, increase accountability, and accelerate
liberalisation in early 2000, but so far the results have been mixed.

Malawi's economy still remains heavily dependent on aid from international ﬁnancial
institutions and individual donors; in March 2000 the country started the process for
obtaining debt relief under the HIPC initiative. 1  

The interim PRSP reconﬁrms that poverty reduction is the overarching objective of all
government policies. It is recognised that broad based smallholder agriculture led
growth is a precondition for achieving sustained poverty reduction. In addition free and
competitive markets, stimulating off-farm activity in rural areas, small scale and labour ,
intensive manufacturing, also through the informal sector, need to be developed.

In the social sector, education and health will remain priority areas for resource
allocation. Already the share of the social sector expenditures (recurrent plus
development) has risen markedly froin 8% in 1990/1 to 12% of GDP in 1998/9.

Following the introduction of free universal primary school education, the 2 major goals
are presently to increase access to quality, relevant and efﬁcient education for children
and youth, and to ensure that the education system does not intensify existing
inequality. The problems faced in the secondary school sector are similar to those in
primary - with the added complication that there appears to be a funding gap for this.
Entry to tertiary education is very low with the annual intake around 4000, while there

 

 

are equally limited opportunities for vocational training at the few institutions in the
country.

The policy goal in the health sector is to raise the level of health status of all Malawians
by reducing the incidence of illness and occurrence of death. Health has been accorded
priority funding status under the new government (at 3.3% of GDP it is above the sub-
Saharan African average of 2.4%), however this has not been translated into tangible
.results and real per capita expenditures remain ’below international targets,

The provision of health services has so far had little or no impact on the overall national
indicators of health which remain appalling, as they are inextricably linked with other
non-health factors such as malnutrition/food security, education/literacy, water and

sanitation. The HIV/AIDS crisis and the various devaluation of the Kwacha have
equally compounded that situation. '

0 Donor Co-ordination

The European Union, the World Bank and the United Nations are the major multilateral
agencies active in Malawi. Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan, Denmark, Norway, the
Netherlands, and the United States are the major bilateral donors. Almost all donorsﬂare
involved in a variety of programs in agriculture, infrastructure, ﬁnance, social sectors

Cotonou Agreementz. The overall objective is the improvement of the economic and
social conditions of the population in keeping with the real needs of local communities.

The main criteria speciﬁed by the Lome’ Convention are that projects have to be
undertaken by direct request of the community, and that the community has to
contribute at least 25 percent to the implementation of the projects, either in cash or in
kind. The 1992 Frish letter better deﬁnes the concept of micro projects and draws clear
guidelines for intervention3.

Under the auspices of the 6th EDF, a grant of three million Euro was allocated to the
ﬁrst MPP in October 1994 to cover the period 1995 to 1997. In its initial phase the
Programme implemented 833 projects, mainly in the education sector (88.53%). Other
sectors were allocated funding as follows: Health (2,64%), Communication (2,61%) and
Community Development (0,80%).

The 15‘ MPP programme constructed:

(a) 380 school blocks for a total of 760 classrooms
(b) 291 teachers’ houses

(c) 17 under-ﬁve clinics

(d) 34 smaller bridges

(e) 12 miscellaneous projects

The geographical coverage of the 151 MPP was quite evenly distributed over the three
regions of the country and population density was also taken into account. 228 projects
were situated in the Northern region, 319 in the Central Region and 286 in the Southern
Region.

Since the 1St MPP was unable to satisfy the high demand from the communities, a
second grant of 6.380.000 Euro was awarded in July 1996 under the 7th EDF.
Consequently, ﬁnancing more than doubled in the second phase of the programme when
the average annual funding rose to 3.100.000 Euro as opposed to 1.500.000 Euro per
year in the ﬁrst phase. ' .

The 2nd MPP was implemented in the period from 1997 to 1999. An analysis of the data
collected in the ﬁnal evaluation of the second programme reveals that, as in the case of
the 1St MPP, most of the projects addressed a need in the Educational sector (72,63%)

while Health accounted for 4,15%, Communication for 5,19%, Water and Community
Development for 15,69%, and 2.33% was allocated to other sectors.

The 2nd MPP programme constructed:

(a) 890 school blocks for a total of 1780 classrooms

(b) 209 teachers’ houses

(c) 259 bore-holes .

(d) 32 projects in the health sector (mainly under-ﬁve clinics and staff houses)
(e) 40 roads/bridges

(f) 18 miscellaneous projects

The geographical coverage of the 2"d MPP was less evenly distributed than the 15‘ MPP.
At one stage the Steering Committee suspended further funding to the Southern Region
due to slow implementation rates in some districts in the South.

,The MPP was considered a successful example of co—operation between the EU and
Malawi, and the European Commission Delegation under the 8th EDF continued to
support the programme. ‘

The National Indicative Programme (NIP) for the 8lh European Development Fund
(EDF) was approved in March 1997. The programme’s overall medium and long—term
objective is the ﬁght against poverty while its speciﬁc objectives are to:

1. Develop a sound transpon infrastructure system; _'

2. Promote sustainable and efﬁcient utilisation of natural resources through appropriate
agricultural and environmental policies and practices;

3. Improve the health status of the population by delivering a more comprehensive set
of promotional, preventive and curative services.

These three objectives reinforce sector development policies and the national policy on
poverty alleviation. The Micro Projects Programme is not clearly deﬁned as a sector
(either focal or non-focal); instead commitment to the MPP is shared between several
sectors, including natural resources, health and population. Four million Euro were
allocated to the first sector while the second sector was expected to receive three million
Euro. .

Despite these basic guidelines, the 8‘h EDF and the MPP ﬁnancial proposal allocated 15
million Euro to support education and other sectors, in short, more than was earmarked
for natural resources and health. At this stage, the MPP adopted ‘a strategy for
intervention without real co-ordination with the NIP, which considers the MPP more an
instrument for implementation than an independent programme.

Because of the demonstrated excellence in implementing capacity, the 3rd MPP under
the 8‘" EDF received further funding to cover the period 1999 to 2002. The ﬁnancial
proposal allocated ﬁfteen million Euro to the 3rd MPP (an average of ﬁve millions per
year) but this sum was later increased to eighteen million Euro (six million /year).

 

 

 

 

In total, the European Union has allocated more than 27 million Euro to the Micro
Projects Programme in Malawi over a period of less than seven years. The amount is
signiﬁcant considering non—focal sector orientation of the Programme. Funding
available on an annual basis has also increased signiﬁcantly from an average of
1.500.000 Euro to the present 6.000.000 Euro. This growth has been exponential and
has probably reached its limit, in view of that fact that with the actual approach the
programme risks to become a substitute for the government in providing social
infrastructure. ‘

2.2 The 3"]111icr0 Project Programme

0 The Financial Proposal for the 3rd MPP and its Objectives

The ﬁnancial proposal for the 3rd MPP was approved in January 1999. The
programme’s overall stated objective was to contribute to the alleviation of poverty by
helping to improve the living standards of the beneﬁciary communities and individuals.

Project purpose

The following objectives were identiﬁed in the ﬁnancial proposal:

a) To consolidate and strengthen the existing self-help Spirit prevalent among
Malawians, particularly in rural areas. '

b) To contribute to a school environment conducive to better teaching and learning
through the provision of adequate school infrastructures.

c) To make rural life more attractive through the provision of small feeder roads and
bridges, under-ﬁve clinics, postal agencies, bore holes and shallow wells, and more
signiﬁcantly, to enable communities to access small capital items through micro
credit schemes. v

These objectives were deﬁned in more detail in the Third Micro-projects Programme —
Lome’ IV— Work Programme and Cost Estimate N ° 1, Malawi 1999, which enumerated:

1. Provision of ﬁnancial assistance, regardless of political inclination, to any group of
rural and urban people engaged in self-help projects as a means to encourage and
, promote their self-help spirit.

2. Independently provide ﬁnancial assistance to rural and urban people in order to meet
the government commitment to poverty alleviation.

3. Provide ﬁnancing for capital items in order to enable groups of rural communities to
nnprove their income generating capacity through activities such as livestock
produce, horticulture, maize mills, etc.

 

.- .- u-

t- .- .-

 

 

4. Provide small grants to rural communities who may engage in beneﬁcial and
innovative technologies.

5. To consolidate the needs previously addressed such as providing school desks for
pupils and safe drinking water. '

6. To provide further infrastructure facilities in the education, health, communication,
community development and other sectors.

7. To induce rural and urban communities to initiate projects which have an immediate
impact on their livelihoods.

8. To assist the communities, both rural and urban, to implement projects which will
protect the environment

In addition to meeting the above objectives, the Micro-Projects Programme also had to
address issues such as sustainability, infrastructure maintenance, gender and linkage

with other EDF funded programmes.

The ﬁnancial proposal deﬁned budget allocation by sector and outlined the total number
of planned projects.

As in the case of the two previous programmes, the 3rd MPP remained a demand driven
programme, which required that the communities directly request eachintervention.

The 3rd MPP implemented the following projects, which were scheduled at the ﬁnancial
proposal stage". '

 

‘ At this stage seems important to clarify the deﬁnition of “project” as used in the context of the MPP
that considers each single intervention implemented in a village as a project. For example, if the MPP
builds a teacher’s house, a school block and one bore hole for the school in the same village, these three
infrastructures are regarded as three different projeéts.

As was the case with the 2nd MPP, the 3rd MPP is a national programme, which is still
ongoing at the time of this evaluation. Quite a large number of projects have already
been completed and all funds in the budget have been allocated;

According to the criteria for the Micro Projects Programme, (Article 252, Lomé
Convention), the projects have to be undertaken at the initiative of local communities
who must contribute in kind or cash to their implementation. Contributions within the
framework of the 3rd MPP are mainly in kind with only a few cases of="'cash
contributions reported.

The programme design is quite similar to the previous two MPPs with no signiﬁcant
changes introduced. The Logical Framework built into the ﬁnancial proposal is annexed .
(annexe n° 4). ~

 

 

3. RELEVANCE OF THE PROGRAMME

The need for social infrastructures remains high in Malawi. Initial availability was very
poor which means that there is a big gap to be ﬁlled. Furthermore, the rapid population

growth, estimated at three percent per year, continues to raise the demand for new social
infrastructures.

The ﬁrst and second MPPs gave priority to education, mainly at the primary level.
There are two important reasons for this choice:

 In 1994 primary school tuition fees were abolished and subsequently, the demand
increased dramatically. ‘

2) The village’s great importance assigned to the school is particularly inﬂuenced by
the role played by teachers as community leaders. ‘-

In terms of programme relevance, the evaluation team determined that on the whole

there is signiﬁcant correspondence between the programme and the needs of the
country. - .

In the education sector, particularly at the primary level, the MPP acted as a major

stabilising factor for the school system, providing a better environment for both students
and teachers. '

I Generally speaking, the project built new school blocks where substitutes for temporary
classrooms were needed, not new schools 'where none previously existed. This approach
guarantees that teachers are available and that the infrastructure will be used, but at the
same time the improvement is mainly qualitative and not quantitative. Furthermore, the

project provides only school blocks, not entire schools (composed of four school blocks
and eight classrooms).

The programme also performs well in the area of housing for teachers, which is in great
demand.

In the education sector, all communities generally give the school high priority,
consequently, the communities make signiﬁcant work contributions to the project.

At the national level, the programme’s work in the education sector is an appropriate

response to the Malawian government’s efforts to meet the extremely high demand for
primary schools.

The programme also responds to a new demand for secondary schools. In fact, due to
the launch of free enrolment in primary school in 1994, the Minister for Education

(Director of Planning) expects to have a great number of students enter the secondary
level of schooling.

-a..._....4

 

It is important to underline that secondary school is not free and that generally these
students do not come from the most disadvantaged social groups. Since this is the case,
it is not possible to claim a direct link between the projects implemented at the
secondary level of schooling and the overall programme objective of poverty
alleviation.

The situation is more complex with regard to the health infrastructure. From the
viewpoint of need, the structures built by the programme have a high degree of
relevance. The health sector is a real priority for all communities and the demand for
infrastructures is very high. Unfortunately, the sector is also dependent on government
investment to ensure that health centres are properly equipped and staffed.

Small infrastructures, such as the under-ﬁve clinics, which are integrated within an
existing and stable health system in a speciﬁc area, correspond properly with the
country’s needs. The opening of new health centres, on the other hand, seems to be
risky and at times not even sustainable.

The demand for bore holes is very high in all parts of the country. Potable water
remains one of the main priorities for the communities and here, the MPP provides an
appropriate answer to the problem.

When the programme constructs a bore hole, there are two modus operandi: it provides
a village with a bore hole and/or situates the drilling on the school premises. This allows
the programme to address another national priority: in fact many schools do not have
access to water or appropriate sanitary facilities.

The 3rd MPP included Income Generating Activities (IGA) in its range of interventions
even though the programme seems not consider this sector a priority, particularly in the
case of IGA under the direct management of the Micro—project Implementation Unit
(MIU).

The MPP engaged external ﬁnancial intermediaries (F1) to develop IGA but compared
to the other programme sectors, a limited number of projects have been implemented.
The demand remains signiﬁcant, but during the course of the ﬁeld visits, the evaluation
team found that several communities were not aware that the MPP could provide this
type of support.

This sector is highly relevant to the situation in Malawi, but more support from the
programme management is needed. If properly directed, the IGA could provide strategic
support to the implementation of physical projects, allowing the communities to take on
the role of true partners in development.

As far as programme relevance is concerned, the MPP generally meets the needs of the
population. Although the programme concentrates on infrastructure, each project is
linked to a high number of beneﬁciaries, particularly in the case of school blocks,
under-ﬁve clinics, and bore holes. The teachers’ houses have only one direct
beneﬁciary, but the number of indirect beneﬁciaries is high as these types of projects
contribute signiﬁcantly to the stability of the school.

 

 

 

Finally, it is important to highlight the role of the Malawi Social Fund (MASAF), a
national programme funded by World Bank loans. This programme covers the whole
country and builds social infrastructure upon request from the communities. These
requests are submitted through the concerned district authorities. As is the case with the
MPP, MASAF also plays an important role in satisfying the requests originating with
the communities and has very similar relevance. The roles of MASAF and MPP are at
times confused because the population sees the' two programmes as complementary to
each other. At times, this similarity‘ generates misunderstanding and lowers the visibility

of the EU contribution.

3.1 Problem analysis and the needs identification process

Needs identiﬁcation is a crucial stage in the MPP mechanism where the programme
must conﬁrm the true priorities of the community. The process also lays the foundation
for clarity in ownership of the project, which is a strategic element for future project
sustainability.

According to the Operational and Administrative Manual, “development projects need
to be identiﬁed systematically by the communities themselves on the basis of their felt
needs, and with the assistance of relevant non-governmental organisation (if involved),
or the Micro-project Implementation Unit. The community submits the project using a
Projects Proposal Form to the MIU or to the District Development Committee”.

Observations made during the ﬁeld visits conﬁrmed that the MIU rarely interacts "with
the communities at the need identiﬁcation stage. Normally, the communities do not
receive direct support from the unit at this stage and contact with the MIU is infrequent.
The communities primarily act on their own (or sometimes on extemal suggestions from
parliament members, local leaders or district ofﬁcers) when they decide which kind of
intervention to request. Many times the communities receive direct information at the
district level.

The district distributes the forms for submitting requests and explains the modalities for
local participation, sometimes taking on the role of the MIU.

The weakness of the MIU at this stage of the project cycle is quite evident. The MIU
apparently does not consider its participation'at this stage relevant and only attempts to
conﬁrm that the community in question was formally involved in completing the
application forms.

During the ﬁeld visits the evaluation team found that in ninety percent of cases, the
application forms has been distributed by the district. No village had been informed
about the IGA component of the MPP. All villages identiﬁed the MPP as a programme
that builds schools, teachers’ houses and drills bore holes, not as a programme aiming to
empower the communities.

 

m.“ ...._— -- ....— —- .m-

 

In general, the districts inform the communities that they can request similar
interventions from several donors and explain the different rules for each donor agency.
The communities see the MPP as an alternative to other donors for building
infrastructure. On the contrary the programme should participate more directly in this
phase at the village level when the preliminary approach are established.

3.2 Local community capacity absorption

The capacity for absorption into the communities is assured for several reasons:

> The small size of the projects implemented. '

> Spot interventions are favoured over complex and complete projects. As mentioned
above, the. MPP considers each implementation a project (a school block, a teacher’s
house) and normally the programme implements a single project at a time.

> The MPP is oriented to implement projects in communities where no other donors
are working. All efforts to provide in kind and work contributions are concentrated
on the MPP implementation, so there is no conﬂict between projects.

> The lack of social infrastructures is evident and the involvement of the communities
is real. ' '

A community’s capacity for absorption increases in the case of a spot intervention, but
on the other hand, the programme provides the community with an incomplete facility.
For example, a complete primary school is composed of four school blocks, housing for
the teachers and an administrative block, but often the programme builds only one
school block. This method of scattering interventions generates a continue demand for
new actions.  

Sometime this is due to avoid an excessive concentration of projects/intervention in a
village that could generate misunderstanding in other communities not beneﬁting in the
same way. Furthermore the nation-wide approach requires a large distribution of the
project in the country.

The MPP demonstrates a clear capacity to work quickly and the communities recognise
that the programme completes the selected projects on time, but there are several
limitations to this methodology:

- Basic needs (a complete school) are often not fully met.

- All beneﬁciaries expect more interventions from the MPP; they see the programme
as an agency providing unlimited projects over time and their view of the MPP
overlaps with other government interventions. -

- Communities do not consider the programme as a “partner” in development, but
only as a ﬁnancing and implementing actor. '

- The dialogue between the programme and local communities can be improved
(especially in the preliminary phases of the project) and partnership promoted to
stimulate social development.

 

 

3.3 Capacity of the community to ensure participation.

Community participation in project implementation can be observed during several
stages of the project cycle.

1. Participation in decision making: during the ﬁeld visits the evaluation team found
that a consensus was reached before requesting MPP interventions, and that
normally village meetings are held to discuss the requests. Sometimes the traditional
authorities or the village headman promote the initiative. In the case of school
blocks, the teachers who seem to be a «social group» with a strong capacity for
advocacy often support the initiative. .

2. Participation at the contribution stage: almost all contributions have been in kind
and only in a few cases in cash. Participation in kind was generally not a problem,
particularly when the projects were implemented in a single village or in a really
well deﬁned group of beneﬁciaries. In general, participation in kind was determined
through a scheme adopted in all villages: women mainly carried materials and men
generally prepared bricks. According to the communities, women were deeply
involved in the process of participation in kind, and they were “sometimes more
active than the men.” The explanation given was that “women have fewer
engagements in other activities.”

3. Participation in the management of the structure: the situation is not well
deﬁned and varies greatly ﬁ‘om sector to sector. 'In the case of infrastructures for the
education sector, a school committee generally guarantees participation. In themcase
of bore holes, participation in the management process also seems to be active,
particularly in communities where an NGO has provided training. The evaluation
team observed instances of weak management for infrastructures in the health
sector. In that case the communities think that the government should be in charge
of infrastructure management and do not View their own direct participation as
required.

Generally, the communities seem to ensure the participation of all social groups despite
the lack of direct involvement on the part of the MIU. The youth are the only exception
as they seem not really involved in the decision making process. Furthermore, the team
would recommend a speciﬁc investigation to verify the involvement of the poor and less
advantaged segments of the population.

3.4 Reduction of gender inequalities

With the exception of micro-credit facilities, the MPP has not speciﬁcally promoted CO-
operation With women. However, NABW, one of the selected ﬁnancial intermediaries,
works exclusrvely wrth women in the IGA sector.

Generally, projects are not Speciﬁcally addressed to the needs of women, but their
partic1pation lS always extremely important. some women say, that they have a role in
the decrsron making process, and that they have started ’to be more involved in

 

 

le

community decisions. Women also play an important role when providing in kind
contributions, and their presence on corrnnittees is increasingly visible, particularly

where bore hole management is concerned. -

In the case of MPP it is no simple matter to evaluate the reduction of inequality,and the
observations made during the ﬁeld. visits do not allow us to make a conclusive
statement. In actual fact, the importance of women’s participation, particularly in heavy
physical labour, could sometimes be interpreted as a new form of inequality. Women
must work harder than men to compensate for gender inequality and they are more
responsible for the social aspects of community life than men.

As for access to social services the situation for women seemingly does not differ very
much from the situation in the past. Further discussion of the gender issue is included in

the effectiveness analysis.

3.5 Synergy wit/1 other E U projects and donors

The European Union is one of the major donors in Malawi and is very active in several
sectors, particularly in the so-called “focal sectors” (agriculture and natural resources in
the 8‘h EDF, and roads in the 9‘" EDF). Furthermore, the EU is directly involved in the
Food Security Programme. MPP synergy with other EU projects is sometime difﬁcult.

The MASAF programme funded by the World Bank is the main programme with some
degree of interaction with the MPP. Synergy and co-ordination is mainly due to avoid
duplication as both programmes engage in a similar methodology of intervention
(community contribution, use of local contractors, employment of skilled labour).

4. EFFICIENCY

4.1. Means and costs

The Micro-Project Implementation Unit (MIU) has ﬁve ofﬁces: a CentralHead Ofﬁce
(CHO) based in Lilongwe and four Regional Ofﬁces located in Mzuzu (Section 1),
Lilongwe (Section 2), Liwonde (Section 3) and Blantyre (Section 4).

The staff at the CH0 in Lilongwe includes:

1 Programme manager
1 Hydro-geologist

1 Logistics manager

2 IGA ofﬁcers

1 Accountant

1 Secretary

3 Clerks

2 Drivers

1 Ofﬁce cleaner

The four regional ofﬁces are similarly organised and each one employs:

1 Project ofﬁcer
1 Secretary

1 Driver

1 Cleaner

All ofﬁces are equipped with computers, fax machines and a four wheel drive Land
Rover.

The MIU is responsible for all action required ensuring the “successful implementation
of all projects under the MPP.” The MIU receives proposals for inclusion in the MPP
and, as mentioned above, the MIU should support the rural communities in identifying
projects that meet local needs.

The proposals are discussed by a monthly Steering Committee before final approval,
and the regional ofﬁces of the MIU provide support during project implementation.
Furthermore, the MIU staff is responsible for project appraisal, monitoring and
evaluation.

The composition, size and cost of the MIU is determined by the assumption that the
unit 3 total operational costs are ﬁxed at ten percent of total MPP costs as indicated in

 

 

 

- - ~ _ _ ~ — _ — —----_-‘-—e-r- «-

ran

The total budget for the third MPP was at ﬁrst ﬁxed at ﬁfteen million Euro, including
technical assistance cost. Three million Euro were later added fora total budget of
eighteen million Euro. The agreement is valid for three years and will formally expire
on 30‘11 September 2002 (WP and CE n.7 and 8).

The structure of the programme’s overall budget only allows for partial breakdown by
year. The MIU sets its own annual expenses (with the approval of the Steering
Committee) according to the quota of ten percent mentioned above, which is calculated
on the annual total cost of implementing the components of the micro-projects.

Therefore, the annual MIU budget varies with the rate ofimplementation anticipated for
each year and with the corresponding allocation of resources.

As a consequence, the amount allocated to programme management support is subject
to several external economic and ﬁnancial factors (changes in currency rates, inﬂation
and costs increase), which from time to time oblige the MIU to adjust the overall budget
and its own ﬁnancing.

All budget modiﬁcations are taken into account in the annual work programmes and
cost estimates. The ten percent limit is always respected, both in case of an increase or a
decrease in available funds. Overall, this system allows for a general control of
operational costs.

At the time of the current evaluation, another year of implementation was already
planned so it was not possible to calculate total programme costs for micro project
implementations. . * '

However, it is possible to perform an indirect evaluation by comparing implemented
projects with total operational costs. The programme has ofﬁcially implemented and
classiﬁed 1.236 projects (76,5% completed by March 2001) in the ﬁrst and second
phases of the 3rd MPP. The programme expects to complete another 489 projects in the
ﬁnal phase, which ends in September 2002 .

If this implementation rate is respected, the programme will implement a total of 1.725
projects at a total cost of eighteen million Euro. The actual ﬁgures showing how much
was allocated to projects and how much to operational costs will only be available next
year, but assuming the same calculation as before, about 16.2 million Euro will have
been reserved for programme ﬁeld activities and 1.8 million Euro to operational
management.

Thus, the average operational cost is 1.043 Euro per project, which includes all phases
of the project cycle (from identiﬁcation to evaluation). Normally, this also covers a
follow up at the village level requiring twelve to twenty—four months of technical
supervision. -

 

5 The total number of new projects may be modiﬁed in keeping with currency adjustment and funds
availability in 2002. '

ewwe

 

apu

The average cost per project translates into roughly 60.000 MK which, in case of low
cost infrastructures (below 200.000 MK), is slightly on the high side.‘ However, in view
of the distribution of the projects around the countr 1, the distances to be covered, the
number of visits in order to monitor civil works, and the fact that the average cost of the

majority of the infrastructures ranges around 400.000 MK, the average cost can be
considered appropriate.

4.2. Procedures

The procedures for MPP interventions are established in the operating manual, which is

formulated and approved by the Steering Committee.

0 The Steering Committee

The Steering Committee is the policy-making and policy directing body. It executes its

functions through the Programme Manager who is the Chief Executive of the Micro-
Projects Programme.

There are seven permanent members of the Steering Committee as listed below:

A chairman designated by the Ministry of Finance

A representative from the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development

A representative from the National Economic Council I 

A representative from the Ofﬁce of the President and Cabinet (District

Administration)

5. A representative from the Council for the Non-Governmental Organisation of
Malawi (CONGOMA)

6. A representative from the Delegation of the European Commission in'Malawi

7. A Secretary who is normally the MPP Programme Manager

The steering committee meets once a month to approve (or refuse) project proposals.
Major consideration in the approval of a project is given to even geographical
distribution according to district and the size of the population in the distrrct.(the
number of projects per capita and the size of funds already allocated). Standard projects
(such as school blocks) are mainly ﬁnanced in chronological order and the Commrttees
main concern seems to be that the budget line established in the ﬁnancial proposal rs
respected. In that case a deeper application analysis is performed by the project officer
and conﬁrmed by the Programme manager. On the contrary more complete appraisal
from the Steering Committee is due in case of non standard and expensive prejects
(health centres, community hall) or in special cases such as the signature of contract
with Financial Intermediaries.

This mechanism should be integrated with a more complete social and economic
analysis of the expected activities such as for those sustained by lGA.

 

 

 

Finally, the actual composition of the Steering Committee is balanced in favour of the

institutional partners and does not reﬂect the role that civil society should have in the
'MPP.

0 Project cycles in the MI’P operational framework

According to the Operation Manual, the project cycle in MPP is composed of the
following phases:

Project identiﬁcation
Project appraisal

Project approval

Project implementation
Project monitoring

Project completion
Hand-over to the community

$999933”?

1. Project identiﬁcation

Development projects should be identiﬁed by the communities themselves with the
assistance of any concerned NGOs, if involved, or the Micro-projects Implementation
Unit. The proposal is submitted to the MIU and the District Development Committee
(DDC) using the Projects Proposal Form..

Projects, which have no direct bearing _on district development planning, can be
submitted directly to the MIU, and approved without consultation with the DDC. In
such cases, however, copies of the proposal must be sent to the DDC for information.

It is assumed that the MIU may assist the communities in project identiﬁcation, and also
that the MIU may collaborate with other unitsof the EC to appraise projects which will
be beneﬁcial to local communities. The community must respect the 25% contribution
to the total project cost, either in kind by providing services, or in cash.

2. Appraisal
The project appraisal consists of two phases:

0 Desk project appraisal
- Field appraisal

The desk project appraisal conﬁrms:

> That the application is really submitted by a local community and not by an
individual who later might consider the project as his or her property.

)‘> That the application form is signed by the person who will store and guarantee the
security of building materials on and after delivery.

u- -

 

 

 

>

vlu

That the application form is signed by the BBC or a'representative thereof, and
stamped and dated with the DDC’s ofﬁcial date stamp. _

Alternately, if the application is submitted directly to the MIU by the local
community or an NGO, attempts must be made during the ﬁeld appraisal to get the
application stamped with the DDC’s ofﬁcial date stamp.

That all questions and sections of the application form are properly completed.

During the ﬁeld project appraisal, following conditions must be considered:

)>

>

The ofﬁcials of the District Executive Committee (DEC) should be involved as

much as possible;
Comparative data on the district’s population in general and education statistics in
particular must be collected.

Furthermore, an appraisal of the following project criteria must be documented:

VVVVV VVVVV

3.

Preliminary detailed identiﬁcation of the beneﬁciaries and their needs;

The social and economic dynamics of the group;

The real demand for the projects or service;

The suitability and sustainability of the proposed technology;

The involvement of the beneﬁciaries in the design, operation, management and
maintenance of the project;

Security of the input supplies provided to rural communities;

Transfer of the technical skills needed for running the project;

Size of the population in the project gravity area;

Gender balance and the involvement of women in the decision-making process;
Replicability of the project or technology.

Project approval

The regional Project Ofﬁcers undertake the appraisal of submitted proposals. The
criteria for approval of the projects are the same as for the appraisal phase plus:

Project implementation

The implementation of the project may include:

the available funding and the arrangements for implementation, monitoring and the
community’s expected contribution and role. .

> Technical assistance may be provided by individuals, local consulting ﬁrms or
NGOs. Such cost elements are a part of the EC contributions.

> Contract work. '

'5”. Project monitoring

In order to monitor all peltinent information on each project, the data is recorded in a
computerised relational database.

6. Project completion

The MIU conﬁrms project completion through visits to speciﬁc villages.

7 Hand-over to the community

After the project is completed, the infrastructure is handed over to the commmiity. No
speciﬁc internal evaluations are performed on project effects and impacts. 

4.3 The decision making process

The ﬁeld visits allowed the evaluation team to deﬁne the main outlines of the decision
making process at the community level during the stages of project identiﬁcation and
project management. The decision-making process is fundamental to the mechanism of
community empowerment, which is one of the objectives of the MPP.

As mentioned above, the meetings held with the villagers conﬁrmed that the programme
has not yet deﬁned a set method for approaching the population, and that the
communities often made their decisions without direct support from the MPP.

As a consequence, it is possible to state that:

a) the ﬁrst MPP contact is normally not direct but channelled through the district
ofﬁces;

b) the communities are rarely supported in their decisions, in- particular when
identifying their own needs and priorities;

c) the process of selecting a priority to be satisﬁed by the micro project is often
influenced by a “list” of projects offered by the programme. The population knows

t—

— — — _ -  ‘— ‘- ‘- '-

 

1 _
.

which kinds of projects are possible and limits its decision to these potential offers
from the MPP;

d) the community is normally free to decide according to its own set of methods with
little interference from external actors.

As a result, the communities have developed several methods based on their traditions.
The main differences are:

0 The degree of village involvement varies with the impact of the
inﬁ'astructure/service provided by the project

The largest number of villages associated with a project is obtained at the
implementation of health centres and bridges, which normally have a large direct and
indirect impact on an extended area in a district.

0 The decision making levels

All the communities have at least two decision levels: the headmen (or their groups) and
the village meeting which includes the village population.

The committees, which are often established for a speciﬁc work, form a third level. The
committee members take on diréCts responsibility for a certain infrastructure or service
(for example, the committee for bore holes) and the community normally delegates the
management of the infrastructure or’service to the committee. There are only a. few
cases where the committee was established before project implementation and had an
active role in the decision making mechanism.

0 The extent of participation

The majority of the communities conﬁrmed high levels of participation in the meetings
on the MPP projects. It should be noted that at times these meetings were not called to
speciﬁcally deal with the EU programme but project identiﬁcation in general, and that
the village headmen had taken a preliminary decision.

However, almost all villages organised a general meeting to approve the decision before
submitting the application form to the district ofﬁce.

0 Women’s participation
Many women took an active interest in the. ﬁeld visits of the evaluation team. They
participated in the meetings and conﬁrmed their presence and role in the village

decisions.

Furthermore, women are included in several committees and directly manage some of
the infrastructures implemented by the MPP.

 

 

h— -

‘- '- (‘

 

M ,

“M

In general, the women had a positive i111presSiori of the projects, and some of them said
that they now have a new role and responsibility in their community. They are proud of
this role and very active in maintaining it. '

The IGA also generated very positive impacts with the direct involvement of women in
economic activities, which has given them increased responsibility for the socral and
economic development of the villages.

4.4 Population contribution

“T’ he basis for the MPP is the Lomé assumption of a 25% contribution from local
communities towards project costs.

The MIU has conducted estimates of the contributions made by the population to past
project, concluding that in the case of educational and medical infrastructures, the
contribution is higher than 25%, while in case of bore holes and communication
projects (bridges) their contribution is insufﬁcient.

Updated estimates are not available. In general, the MIU believes that the contribution -
varies from a minimum of 10 % to a maximum of 35 %. On average, the MIU assumes
that the requirements for village contribution are met when the construction'of a school
block is combined with the drilling of a bore hole.

This point should be subjected to further analysis also in consideration of the fact that at
the moment local contribution is normally in kind. As only a few communities
contributed cash to buy bricks for the construction of their buildings, a different
approach for the future should perhaps be considered in order to offer more
opportunities to reach the required contribution.

The in kind contributions took several forms, but in general the consolidated scheme
included:

a) brick preparation (including collection of materials, kiln preparation and wood
cutting)

b) collection of stones and sand

0) transportation of materials to the project site

d) provision of unskilled, non-remunerated labour

Contribution levels are the lowest when a civil works contractor is present (as in the
case of bore holes), in which case the village mainly provides sand 'and light labour
(mtensrve labour if a brick wall is built around the bore hole).

Sharing contributions, as well as the identiﬁcation and sharing of the initial decision,
have a positive impact on the communities, raising levels of participation and involving
several stakeholders normally not included in the process. Nonetheless, more detailed
studies should be made on the involvement of the poorest segment of the population in

‘-

‘_ i- -! -! i; .8

‘ ~ .  I ‘ _

 

the programme process. The community normally appreciates the extended participation
and it increases dynamism at the village level.

The contribution sharing was mainly decided village by village under the supervision
and co-ordination of the headmen. Normally, a village contributes the labour of its own
people to perform similar tasks for a given period (for example, twenty persons per
week in rotation).

Since sharing and participating in the contribution gives the community more direct
responsibility and encourages a sense of ownership of the micro project, this mechanism
should be strengthened in future.

The communities state that they respect the gender distribution when participating in the
work. In general, the headmen determined the division of labour with women
responsible for collecting material and transportation while men were required to mould
bricks, break stones and co-operate with civil works.

The labour assigned to women was heavy and the communities usually recognised the
importance of their participation. The women themselves emphasise that the project
allows them to increase their level of community participation, and that they feel ready
In participate again in future implementations. I

The evaluation team found some cases of low participation. In particular, some villages
did not appreciate the direct impact on their own social conditions and were unwilling
to share contribution and works with other villages. The larger community reacted by
excluding these villages and sharing the costs among those villages that expressed a" real
interest.

4.5 Infrastructure management

The MPP infrastructures are generally in average or good condition. The majority of the
structures are used properly and according to the planned utilisation.

As already mentioned, almost all communities where interviews were conducted have
established a committee in charge of managing the infrastructures. The committee’s role
varies from simple “supervision” (mainly to ensure proper use of the structure) to
complete management, including fund raising for repairs and maintenance.

4.6 Monitoring & Evaluation

MIU had the responsibility to develop a real monitoring system and establishing an
internal database on programme implementation. However, the current internal system
of data recording does not constitute a well-designed monitoring system. Information is
systematically recorded but rarely processed. The only management output is the
quarterly report intended for the Steering Committee but available data mainly concern

-- '—

 

the ﬁnancial implementation of the projects (for example, planned EDF cost vs. actual
expenditures).

The programme obtains a certain amount of data directly from the application forms,
and this. is the stage (identiﬁcation phase) when the project ofﬁcers working at the
community level could collect more complementary information.

Currently available output is too simple and incomplete compared to the programme’s
importance and extent in the country. Direct consultation of the data collected on the
projects does not allow on-the-spot data processing, not even when consulting data in
electronic format. Some of the main difﬁculties encountered are a consequence of
overly simpliﬁed data recording with subsequent serious loss of data and information.

In particular, during the evaluation the team found that the following data should be
collected: ‘

0 Name of each village participating to the project (projects are often listed by the
name of either a school or a site not by village).

0 The number of villages beneﬁting from a certain project and the number of expected
beneﬁciaries by project

9.. The kind and quantity of local contribution ,

o The dates of beginning and completing works

0 Reports on ﬁeld visits. .

0 Remarks on problems (delays, damages) that occurred during the course of a project

0 Data on access to and use of the infrastructures by local actors and beneﬁciaries
(this information should be collected in co-operation with the community) "

The system is set up to respond to the logic of quarterly reporting rather than to any
implementation of real monitoring. In general, no indicators have been established for
programme targets, and the targets change-freely in response to external ﬁnancial
factors that inﬂuence the implementation rates. There is also no clear deﬁnition of the
ex-ante situation before programme implementation.

Finally, the programme does not have up-to-date copies of locally available information
on socio-economic indicators. Existing information, data and publications on the most
important sectors related to the programme were not available at the programme ofﬁces
during the course of the evaluation. Some of this information was collected directly.
from local institutions and authorities where the evaluation team visited.

There is room for improvement to the programme’s internal monitoring system. In the
future, a well-designed monitoring system should contribute to more accurate, detailed
planning and implementation of programme activities. An improved data recording and
processing system would also permit a more detailed evaluation and assessment of the
programme’s effects and impacts. Finally, improvement could also be expected
introducing new software for the accounting system of the programme.

5. EFFECTIVENESS

This analysis of the programme’s effectiveness is based on the objectives established in
the programme documents, in particular the ﬁnancing agreement and the subsequent
annual work programme. The evaluation has been performed by sector in accordanCC
with the indications provided in the terms of reference.

As indicated in the initial report, the evaluation team utilised direct ﬁeld visits and
meetings with specially selected actors for its analysis of programme effectiveness. The
team organised ﬁeld visits to:

1. programme infrastructure and reforestation sites
2. income generating activity sites

The team selected and stratiﬁed the infrastructure sample to be representative of the
typologies of implemented micro projects without taking into consideration the
statistical component of the selection. Considering the large number of completed
ittfrastructures, this approach allowed the team to give priority to the qualitative aspects
of the evaluation.

The following criteria were used to select a random sample:

1. To visit all four project sections.
To visit at least 25% of the districts in the country. The districts play a strategic'role
in the programme as they collect requests and act as the link between the
community and the MPP.

3. To visit all types ofmicro projects.

At the time of the evaluation, several of the 3rd MPP projects had not yet been
completed or were very recently completed. Consequently, it was nearly impossible to
assess real effects and impacts. Therefore, the evaluation team scheduled ﬁeld visits to
earlier projects completed wider ﬁrst and second MPPs in order to verify ﬁrst impacts
and long term sustainability. These visits permitted the team to verify: ‘

a) actual physical state of the project;
b) actual rate of utilisation;
c) community adoption and maintenance procedures.

Furthermore, open interviews were scheduled with the communities in order to address
the following issues:

1. Decision making process (with particular attention paid to women’s participation
and role);

2. Cost and cost sharing (contributions from the communities);

Infrastructure use;

4. Future management

The interviews were based on an open questionnaire for all sectors and categorles
(block schools, bore holes. under-ﬁve clinics, bridges. community halls, postal

agencies, reforestation sites) in order to respond to the speciﬁc requirements outlined in
the Terms of Reference.

Some ﬁeld visits to evaluate Income Generating Activities (IGA) were also scheduled.
The team visited:

1. IGAs realised through ﬁnancial intermediaries
2. lGAs ﬁnanced directly by the Micro project implementation Unit

n

The outputs of the ﬁeld visits were later crossed with ministry data and the results of the
open meetings with information from sector ministries.

The indicators were only partially quantiﬁed through the programme. As already
mentioned the programme’s internal database is not organised in such a way as to
provide sufﬁcient information, and external availability of direct data on the MPP
project sites is very poor.

For these reasons, the evaluation was re-oriented to assess on—going trends for each
indicator according to an analytical approach that crossed the basic data and statistics
available (for example, for the primary and secondary schools) with interviews with
actors and stakeholders. ‘

It was particularly difﬁcult to assess the effects of postal agencies and health centres as
all project sites where the team visited were still under construction. Consequently, the
team was unable to evaluate direct impact on social indicators.

 

The team visited a total of forty-three projects in sixteen districts as outlined in the table
below. (The projects are identiﬁed according to type of infrastructure.)

5.1 Sector 1: Education

d . . .
The 3r MPP concentrated the largest number of mlcro pl‘OJCCl'S at both the primary and
secondary school levels in the education sector. The Programme mainly builds school
blocks, teachers’ houses (in red brick or cement block), and administrative ofﬁces. All

the infrastructures are equipped with desks, tables and chairs. Ventilated pit latrines
complete the buildings.

The expected effects of these projects are largely related to the improvement of general
teaching conditions which is a recognised priority for of the country. Classrooms are
frequently temporary and students attend lessons under a tree without access to
permanent buildings. Teachers often have no permanent accommodation and normally
live in rented houses, which are sometimes located far from the school premises.

It is the policy of both the government and the MPP to:

0 provide stable and permanent school buildings;

0 offer more comfortable living conditions to teachers in rural areas;
0 improve the standard of the school habitat;

a increase student enrolment rates;

0 counter and decrease school drop out rates;

0 improve the classroom/pupil ratio with a target of maximum sixty students per class;

0 improve access to secondary school in view of the increases in‘primary school
enrolment since 1994 when “free primary education” was launched.

The MPP contributes in an appropriate way to positive results in the villages. The

following table summarises the completed projects under the different Micro Projects
Programmes.

Each school block is composed of two classrooms for a total of 3.680 classrooms. To
determine the number of student beneﬁciaries, the programme calculates an average of

60 pupils/classroom for a total of more than 220.000 students , but this number is purely
indicative. ‘

Generally, the MPP is not involved in building new school blocks but its intervention is
limited to replacing existing traditional and temporary school buildings. In tlns way, the

risk that no teachers may be available is veiy close to zero, and the government faces no
extra costs to make the schools operational. -

In order to cover adequately a complete school cycles, each primary school should have
four school blocks and eight classrooms. The project sites visited were not close to
completion as more school blocks were still required. '

The mission visited fourteen school blocks (four of which were constructed with cement
blocks) and thirteen teachers’ houses. The following table lists the infrastructures where
the team visited by location, district, section, year of construction, MPP and actual
condition of the buildings.

As mentioned above, the programme does not record data for social indicators at the

the buildings are utilised and the degree of utilisation seems to be very high,

a!»

b) Enrolment rates have been increasing slightly in recent years.

c) Girls’ enrolment estimated at 40% of total enrolment remains lower than for
boys.

d) Overall enrolment rates _ are low when compared to total population
estimates. However, closer investigation to record the exact population by
village, number of children of school age and school attendance in the same
year is recommended.

e) The average number of pupils per classroom in the schools where the‘ team
visited is very high. In the case of new classrooms. there are 101 students per
classroom, and where temporary classrooms are'still utilised the average
number of pupils per classroom is 79.

f) The drop out rate is very high, in particular at the secondary school level. (In
one case, it was about 20% of annual enrolment).

g) Girls and young women are more likely than boys to drop out of secondary
school. The main reasons are pregnancy and ﬁeld work.

11) Enrolment rates at the secondary school level have been seriously affected
by new school fees recently introduced by the govermnent.

i) Many schools do not completely meet requirements for classrooms and
services (latrines).

j) In a very few cases, the school furniture was incomplete and/or damaged.

k) The general condition of the infrastructures is good. We only found two
cases (built in 1997) where the school blocks required urgent repairs.

1) Generally speaking, the communities valued the school blocks very highly.

They appreciate the availability of a proper teaching environment.

m) There was one case where the school block replaced an existing structure

p)

Cl)

located far from the new premises (Matete). The community said that the
distance between the school and the villages had been reduced from four to
less than one kilometre. '

As in the case of the school blocks, there are not enough teachers’ houses to
meet the need in the villages. where the team visited. In actual fact, almost
half the teachers do not have ﬁxed accommodation, which leads to a state of
inequality among the teachers. .

All the schools where the team visited had established their own committees
to manage the buildings and the relationships with the students’ families.

In one case (Mioho), the school block was misused (as storage for building
materials), but the village was undertaking a new building project and the
school was closed for the holiday period.

Many teachers complained of over-use of the infrastructures mainly during
the rainy season when temporary classrooms are not available or too
dangerous to use (temporary structures ﬁ'equently collapse in the wind and
rain). ‘

 

Finally, during the ﬁeld visits the team found a very strong interest in using cement to
build school blocks. The communities prefer cement because of its low environmental
impact (less or no tree cutting) and because it is less labour intensive.

Remarks and suggestions

1. The MPP should focus on building complete schools in the future, whenever
possible, prioritising complete eight classrooms projects.

2. The programme should try to ensure a balanced distribution of housing among

teachers.

The MIU should follow up on the social impact of drop-out and enrolment rates in

an appropriate and accurate way.

4. The programme should consider increasing supervision oi‘schooi block use.

5. The programme should consider ways to increase access for the poorest segment of
the population to the services provided.

6. Cement block construction should be given preference. Other building materials and
systems should be analysed and compared for technical, economical and
environmental aspects with a view to possible integration into programme building
methods.

5.2 Sector 2: Health

The measurable impact of many structures was not quantiﬁable because the relevant
structures were still under construction at the time of the scheduled ﬁeld visits and
evaluation. The only operational structure was the under-ﬁve clinic in Uliwa. Due to

this state of affairs, the team was only able to gain a partial overview of the sector. (See
the table below.)

Nevertheless, the team was able to assess the following points during the ﬁeld visits:

a) All the projects adhere to national priorities and community needs.

b) There was a high degree of community involvement at the two sites where the
team visited with a large number of villages involved in the project.

c) Community participation in the building process was high.

d) Building the centres require a lot of bricks which has a strongly negative impact
on the environment. ‘

e) Construction costs have increased signiﬁcantly which means that in terms of

absolute value the cost of the health centres is very high (from six to twelve
million MK). "

select from 4 to 6 districts in the ﬁrst where to develop its bore hole component and
move to a second group of districts in the next year. In this way programme efﬁciency
and supervision could be signiﬁcantly increased reducing distances and cests.

Particular attention should be paid to local contributions Other programmes are
stimulating cash contributions from the community in order to compensate for the
generally low in kind contribution (for example. the National Water Development
Programme speciﬁes a five percent cash contribution).

Finally, the visibility of the EU logo should be improved and combined to small
awareness advertisement on the bore hole use and maintenance.

0 Community Hall

The halls where the team visited seem to play an important role in strengthening the
communities and community life. In particular, the multi-pulpose halls demonstrated
high potential for bringing people together and promoting social activities.

Unfortunately, both the halls were close to religious premises and inﬂuence. The risk is
that population views the halls as structures far removed from their own needs which
sometime generates misunderstandings about ownership and access to the structures.

Furthermore, these types of infrastructures (generally very big) have a serious impact on
the environment because of the high volume of bricks used and require serious
measures to compensate for the damage. - '

Finally, both halls where the team visited had high running costs which requires well
developed skills for appropriate ﬁnancial and economic management.

Remarks and suggestions

In the future, the MPP should develop better selection procedures for site location and
increase community involvement in site identiﬁcation and management planning. To
favourite the use of the infrastructures, smaller size halls with lower lunning cost should
be promoted at community level.

As in the case of other infrastructures, the MPP should evaluate alternative building
materials to brick. One option is strictly link the construction with a reforestation
programme at the village level.

5.5 Income generating activities

The MPP implemented Income Generating Activities (IGA) both through local ﬁnancial
intermediaries and directly through the MlU itself.

 

 

- - - -    “- '- '- '-  ‘h- '_ ’_ ’-  -

IGA managed through Financial Intermediaries (F1)

The IGA supported by ﬁnancial intermediaries had mixed results. Some of the FI which
were involved at the start of the initiative have since been excluded from the programme
due to non-compliance with the agreement they signed (audits not respected). These F I
are no longer partner in the implementation of IGA.

Other F I operated very well and gave the programme a direct point of contact with their
members and local populations. Some improvements could still be made, but in general
the initiative seems to have a positive impact also in the short term.

The evaluation team made the following observations after meeting with F l and visiting
IGA project sites:

a) The assignment of funds to the FI gave women direct access to a signiﬁcant

number of loan facilities such as the Micro Credit Facilities for Women
 (MCF W). ' '

b) Data provided by the programme demonstrate that the reimbursement rates
through the F I seem to be appropriate. ‘

c) The MCF W demonstrates real economic and social empowerment of women’s
groups. ' i '

d) The programme implementation guaranteed effective start-ups of micro-business
activities in the villages.

e) The section has positive direct and indirect impacts on poverty alleviation and
reduction. A social survey recently issued by one of the FI made a similar
assessment. .

f) Where the evaluation team visited, the F1 supported the credit facilities with
business plan formulations. Technical assistance .was also provided (in
management and skills improvement), but it was dependent on ﬁnancial support
from other development agencies. '

g) FI supervision indicates that there is a general respect for the twenty percen
cash contribution required accessing the micro-credit. ‘

Based on its analysis of the micro—credit and IGA processes the team would like to
emphasrse some areas where improvements could be made.

There were no fixed procedures for the initial selection of F l. and each FI had different
procedures for loan disbursement. The consequence is poor control by MPP‘ and general
difﬁculty in monitoring the process itself.

Some of the FI showed limited capacity for disbursing loans. The allocated funds are
not completely spent and the effectiveness of the programme has been slightly reduced.

The programme has not renewed any agreements with the 171 since 1999 and as a result,
there are misunderstandings about the ownership of reimbursed funds and their future
utilisation (as in the case of NABW). A portion of the funds comes- from external

 

.— .-
._ .. 

sources (for example, directly from EU without going through the MPP), and there is
some confusion about the future destination of these funds.

r-
“w...

Annual disbursement is not clearly deﬁned at the time of writing. The current system of
ﬁnancial reporting does not permit a clear statement of periodic updates to fund
"allocation, but includes all funds in the total amount disbursed since the beginning of

the MPP (occasionally including previous programmes).

J

The IGA component is not well integrated with other MPP activities. The programme
delegates responsibility to the PI and credit is disbursed independently of other MPP
interventions. This reduces the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the programme and since
no relation between credit and projects is established, the logic of integrated
development is missing. '

.-

 

‘-

Furthermore, the IGA is mainly implemented at an individual or small group basis with
no involvement at the community level (as outlined in the programme documents).
consequently, many opportunities to develop a community credit scheme are lost and
the villages cannot develop socio-economic activities with MPP ﬁnancial support.

Finally, there are some cases of evident overlapping between MPP infrastructures and
IGA in cases of individual investments (for example, maize mills built under the PAP).
This could create misunderstandings about credit responsibility and suggests that this
type of MPP support sustains private investment and not community targets.

0 Fixed Asset Programme ﬁnanced by MIU

The MIU has implemented some projects directly under its Fixed Assets Programme
(FAP). In these cases, the MIU had direct contact with the beneﬁciaries and the credit
facilities were managed and supervised by the MIU itself.

The FAP also demonstrated a low level of integration with other MPP projects and
limited involvement of the community. In general, the number of activities implemented
is limited, the reimbursement rate is low, and the direct involvement of. the MIU does
not provide additional benefit over the Fl activities. The MIU seems to be engaged in
credit management without co-ordination with mainstream programme activity.

Remarks and suggestions

At the end of the 3rd MPP the number of F1 should be reduced and proper selection
procedures put in place. At the same time, the programme should evaluate the ﬁnancial
situation of each F1 and take a clear position on the final destination of residual funds
(including those funds that have been reimbursed to the programme).

No further allocation of funds to F1 should be implemented until a clear framework for
the sector’s potential is provided.

 

 

 

 

 

In future, ﬂexibility should be introduced in establishing Fl running cost to manage
credits. Small scheme credit (sometime no higher than 1.000 MK) are expensive to be
managed and monitored at national level. A case by case analysis (for each FI) of the

“costs is recommended.

The MIU should suspend the direct management of loans delegating this function to the
F1. The MPP IGA Unit should be mainly oriented towards monitoring and evaluating FI
activities. The introduction of common regulations for loan disbtu‘sement and updated,
renegotiated agreements with selected Fl would expedite control of the F I.

Loan disbursement under the FAP should be suspended at least two years before the end
of the next MPP in order to allow reimbursements to be completed within the scheduled

period of duration of the programme.

Finally, the MPP should permit loan disbursement of F I at the community level in order
to support the establishment of community economic associations and social groups
(community maize mills, community stores, grocery, maize banks, and other projects
directly promoted by the communities) and contribute directly to community
empowerment through fund management. Furthermore, MPP infrastructures and IGA
should only be integrated when there is a real direct involvement from the community
(with local contributions). '

5.6 Crosscutting issues

> Reforestation and environment

During the 3rd MPP attempts were made to reduce the negative impact on environment
when using bricks for construction. The preparation of bricks requires the cutting and
burning of large numbers of trees. In addition, this work is often done by unskilled
labourers in the villages, which can results in poor brick quality and excessive
consumption of wood.

The pilot projects established in the villages had conﬂicting results. In some cases,
reforestation is under control with good recovery of trees, while in other villages the
results are poor with loss of planted trees. This is probably due to several factors such as
the nation-wide distribution of the projects that generates high cost for running effective
reforestation programmes.

The reforestation programmes could also become an important income—generating
source for the communities. in fact. in many villages where the team visited, tree
planting is pursued as an individual economic activity but these small-scale operations
are still unable to meet the high demand for wood from individual households.

The.Ml’P should increase its efforts to sensitise the population to the environment
continuing to contribute to a deep cultural change. A well-deﬁned reforestation
programme should be planned and developed for inclusion in all community projects
that consume large quantities of wood (halls and health centres in particular).

 

 

- - _  ,-  .‘.‘_‘.’_‘_'~_ '- ‘- "- ‘— ‘-

.._‘

Finally, the programme should improve co-operation and co-ordination with other
national programmes (Public Work Programmes) which have more experience with the
environmental aspects. Such programmes would probably be more effective than the
“MPP and encourage income generation on a larger scale.

> Gender Issues

All MPP interventions aim to empower women in the community. In general, wherever
women become more involved in community activities. their participation in the
decision making processes and their involvement in project implementation also
increase.

Women are members of several committees (in particular. school and bore hole
committees) and have also assumed responsible roles. Some women are chairmen of
their committees or manage fund raising at the village level. In general, the women we
met during the visits seemed to take a very active role in their community even if their
position at times was secondary to men. Only in one case did a woman represent her
community. ' -

The Micro Credit Facilities for Women programme had a particularly positive impact.
The majority of women taking part in the credit scheme improved their own economic
position and/or started a new small economic activity to further their position. In
interviews the F I conﬁrmed that about 70% of women in the programme are actually
above the poverty line.

The MIU should monitor these impacts directly in order to improve the evaluation of
project efﬁciency and effectiveness, in particular, where the poorest segment of the
population is involved in the project implementation. The evaluation of the micro-credit
component (and other programme components) cannot be left to the each F1. The ex-
ante situation should be clearly deﬁned and the programme should employ objectively
veriﬁable indicators that can be applied across the board.

Nevertheless, the ﬁeld visits conﬁrmed the importance of the micro-credit component in
strengthening the social and economic roles of women. The decision to make the credit
opportunity available to small groups of women sits well with the MPP logic of
empowerment and awareness—raising.

6. PROGRAMME IMPACT

0"

This evaluation of the 3rd MPP was performed ten months before scheduled rogramme
conclusion (September 2002) in order to guarantee continuity between the 3r and the 4‘h
MPP. For this reason, the evaluation has assumed the aspects of an on-going evaluation
rather than a final one.

Some planned impacts of the 3rd MPP have not been achieved yet while other impacts
were the result of the two previous rounds of the MPP. It has to be emphasised that the
planned objectives and the expected results differed slightly from programme to
programme and that the methodology for implementation was quite similar over time.

The design of the 3rd MPP (and the previous two rounds of the programme) gave high
priority to physical construction of micro-projects with marginal or indirect action
addressing the social and economic factors at the community level.

This approach equipped the programmes with an extraordinary capacity to implement
large number of micro-projects which aim to contribute to poverty alleviation more
increasing the availability of services, rather than providing an immediate and effective
improvement of local social indicators. These indicators will only improve over the long
term when increased access to the services will be probably achieved across the board.

-5

For that reason there is limited impact taking root in the communities as a result of the
previous two programme rounds. "' '

On the contrary, the main strategic national documents on poverty indicate that the
actions to be supported in order to alleviate and reduce poverty are the diversiﬁcation of
income generating activities, access to ﬁnancial opportunities (credit) and speciﬁc
options for less advantaged social and economic groups. The poorest people being
victims of the poor socio-economic potential of Malawi and the unbalanced distribution
of resources in the country.

As indicated in the draft of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)8 issued in
October 2001, poverty in Malawi is "...a state of continuous deprivation or a lack of
the basics of life ” including economic, social, psychological and physiological
requirements. “Poverty exists, and is observable, at various levels: at the individual,
household, community and national levels. Qualitative9- information from the poor
themselves also deﬁnes poverty in terms of lack of felt basic needs at household and
community level.” “Poverty in Malawi is caused by a myriad of factors. Many of these
are constraints on the economic productivity of land, labour, and capitalsConstraints on
the productivity of land include low agricultural productivity, rapid environmental

 

 

8 The paper is not yet ofﬁcial, but the analysis included in the document constitutes an important updated
picture of the national poverty framework. v

Voices of the Poor, i999.

degradation and limited or inadequate access to land. Constraints on labour include
generally low levels of education, poor health status, lack of or limited off~farm
employment, and rapid population growth. The key constraint on capital is lack of
access to credit. All of these factors causing poverty are exacerbated by generally weak
institutional capacity within the country.” “Most of the poor are concentrated in the
rural areas where there are limited economic activities. Rural development would
therefore form the core of program implementation with the aim of increasing people’s
cash incomes and access to basic services. The poor socio-economic indicators point to
the need to improve access and delivery of social services and therefore increase and
improve human development. There are implementation gaps in the quality and access
to health services both in terms of preventative and treatment of diseases. Improving the
quality and access to education is a pre-requisite to developing the country’s appropriate
skills and knowledge. Food security is a serious threat to better life and this often
translates into problems of malnutrition. Food security is very dependent on size of
land, available factors of production and a person’s purchasing power. The stability or
erosion of purchasing power also has strong linkages on the macroeconomic stability of
the economy.” '

This leads us to the following observations on the impacts of the 3rd MPP:

> The micro-project programmes operated mainly in favour of increasing the
availability of services without direct action and/or impact on access (in particular to
education and health facilities).

> The MPP was not required to address its activities directly at the poorest segments
in the communities, but provides services to the population as a whole without any
distinction of social conditions. ,

> The credit facility provided to women is the most important direct opportunity that
favours less advantaged social groups. '

> Under the current programme strategy some opportunities and possibilities are only
partially achieved. This risks reducing the overall importance of the programme
impacts in the struggle against poverty.

However, some social results that could contribute to important impacts have been
achieved. These include:

0 Increased dynamism and importance of the role for the community (due to
recognition of the role of the communities by the traditional authority);

0 The empowerment of women (which unfortunately does not mean directly the
poorest women);

0 Support for decentralisation and community participation in the decision making
process.

These three elements actually represent an extraordinary starting point for strengthening
the MPP strategy of poverty alleviation. This strategy should give priority to the
enhancement of social and economic development by improving the participation of the
poor in project implementation.

It is important to acknowledge the approach included in the draft of the next PRSP
which assumes the following four pillars:

1. Sustainable Pro-Poor Economic Growth: economically empowering the poor by
ensuring access to credit and markets, skills development and employment
generation. '

2. Human Capital Development: ensuring the poor have the health status and

education to lift themselves out of poverty. ,

Improving the Quality of Life for the Most Vulnerable: providing sustainable

safety nets for those who are unable to beneﬁt from the ﬁrst two pillars.

4. Good Governance, Political Will and Mindset: ensure that public and civil
society institutions and systems protect and beneﬁt the poor. ' -

DJ

Future MPP strategies will con-ﬁrm integration with this national strategy, identifying a
new approach and methodology for encouraging community involvement and
empowerment, addressing the needs of poor people and increasing the participation of
marginal vulnerable social groups (women, youth, orphans).

Serious efforts should be made to ensure better co-ordination with the policies of the
district assembly and other development programmes in order to maximise medium and
long term impacts in the struggle against poverty.

Finally, at present, prograrrune outputs are not periodically reported to other donors and
the national authority in a prompt and appropriate manner. At the same time, the MPP
has poor information and documentation on similar initiatives and projects. This could
affect both co-ordination and planning at the community, district and national levels
with increased risk for programme overlapping and poor effectiveness.

 

7. SUSTAINABILITY

l . . . . .
It PrOJect sustainability currently falls outsrde the direct responsibilities of the MIU. Once
' projects have got off the ground, the MIU guarantees on-going monitoring and
I) supervises direct contributions to the construction projects. However, the MIU, even not

; directly involved, makes many efforts to promote the sustainability of the projects at
village level.

l The following criteria apply to each type of proj ect:

> School blocks and teachers’ houses: the MIU does not build new schools but it
I} substitutes blocks for temporary classrooms. In this way the programme avoid to
_ i increase the demand for new teachers and the schools are immediately operative

> Health Centres: MIU constructs health centres only after receiving a statement in
writing from the Ministry of Health pledging equipment and stafﬁng for the centre.
Also in this case the target is to have operative sen/ices in a short time.

> Community Halls: the structure is intended to provide free access to the population.

Normally preference is given where potential partner in the hall management (such
as a Parish) is available.

> Bore holes: no speciﬁc criteria to ensure sustainability are speciﬁed by the MIU.

> IGA through Fl: the ﬁnancial intermediaries perform own evaluations and set
conditions according to their own criteria. '

> IGA through MIU: no criteria are speciﬁed by the'IMU. The limited number of
interventions and their wide variety (ﬁlling stations, engineering groups etc.) do
not allow uniform criteria shared with other micro-proj ects.

> Communication (roads, bridges): no criteria are speciﬁed by the MIU.

7.1 Management and maintenance of physical infrastructures by the commumtres

The actual management and maintenance of physical infrastructures, if any, is organised
by the communities on their own initiative. In general, all communities have established
and organised committees in order to guarantee proper management for at least some of
the facilities.

Communities generally take on the responsibility for small repairs and maintenance of
the infrastructures. In particular:

> All primary schools generally have a school committee in charge of dealing with
the school’s problems. Only few of them have well deﬁned budgets and a fund raismg
[ system. Normally the committees perform only spot interventions and only when

 

 

 

b...— ..

 

 

strictly required. There is no clear idea of maintenance costs and no organised
provisions for the future of the structure. Communities consider themselves able to
manage small repairs, but they consider the government responsible for more important
interventions.

> Teachers’ houses are not generally considered to be in need of maintenance, and
repairs, if any, should be undertaken by the teachers living in the houses. Nevertheless,
rent collected from the teachers (10 to 70 MK per month) sometimes guarantees special
funds for maintenance of the school. This strategy should be extended to other MPP
projects in order to encourage fund raising speciﬁcally for the purpose of guaranteeing
the sustainability of educational structures.

> In the case of secondary schools, committees are established and fund raising is
slightly more developed because the target group normally is not composed of the
poorest members of the community. However, even here the communities tend to
consider the government responsible for the most important interventions to the
infrastructure.

> Health centres. In the health sector thereis a lack of stability and no clear strategy
for sustainability. The population considers the health centre the responsibility of the
Ministry of Health. All community efforts are expected to end with the successful
completion of the centre. It is important to note that the evaluation team was unable to
visit any fully-equipped and operational health centres. The sustainability of this kind of
intervention is seemingly not fully guaranteed.

> Under-ﬁve clinics. There are no committees in charge of the infrastructure. The
communities seemingly do not involved in ownership of the structures.

> Community halls. This sector has its own set of peculiarities. As mentioned above,
the hall is normally built on parish premises. Management of the structure is guaranteed
by a mixed committee where the parish plays a very important, sometimes
predominant, role both in management and maintenance. In these cases, the
“community” is generally identiﬁed with the community frequenting the parish and its
social activities.

> Bore holes. The situation is better due to the availability of organised training for
the bore hole committees. Generally speaking, small maintenance training is guaranteed
at the moment of drilling by the contractor who is in charge of sensitising the
communities. All the bore holes have organised committees who collect funds for ﬁrst
repairs and maintenance. The system of fund raising is neither structured nor uniform.
Some committees ask for ﬁnancial contributions from the direct beneﬁciaries of the
bore holes (admission fees of 20 MK ), other committees only raise funds when they
need to deal with speciﬁc problems such as a break down of the bore hole pump. On the
other hand, some committees collect money periodically in order to guarantee a ﬁxed
budget for infrastructure repair and maintenance. In general, the bore holes are quite
sustainable because most of the small interventions are not really expensive, and on
average an annual amount of 700 MK per bore hole guarantees maintenance. External
contributions should be organised in order to replace the pump at least every ﬁve or

'-—-

 

 

seven years (actual cost of about 40.000 MK). However, even if there is no formal fund
raising procedure in place, some communities can probably afford this extra cost by
organising themselves for long term sustainability.

> Communication (roads, bridges): The community is not involved in medium or
long-term maintenance. They consider such infrastructure the responsibility of the
goverrmient also in cases of small repairs and maintenance. Under actual schemes the
community is not be able to ensure the sustainability of these infrastructures.

7.2 Involvement of local institutions and authorities in the programme

Local institutions, particularly the district authorities, are more involved in the project
identiﬁcation stages than in project utilisation. With the exception of the Ministry of
Education and Science and the Ministry of Health, line ministries are not directly
involved in project management to any particular degree (some of them are only
represented in the Steering Committee in the appraisal phases). These relationships
should be strengthened in order to optimise co-ordination and long term sustainability
of the infrastructures. This problem seems to be more acute for the health centres and
the communication infrastructure (bridges, roads, postal agencies) where no clear
agreements have been made. '

Other donors are also strongly active in the sector. The German government aid agency
is drilling one thousand bore holes in one district, GICA 500 in three districts and
UNICEF is' launching a rehabilitation programme in the north of the country. This
expected important implementation of water projects conﬁrms the need of a strict co-
ordination among the different pro grammes.

7.3 Involvement of NGOs in the programme

The involvement of NGOs in the programme is still limited. Sometimes NGOs are
contracted to drill the bore holes or to organise training on their maintenance aspects.
No NGO participation is expected or promoted in the case of other types of
infrastructure. Generally, the MIU tries to have NGOs as partners in the development
process. This is sometime not achieved because of a low aptitude to co-operate shown at
different level. NGOs are sometime not willing to be periodically monitored by the
programme and reporting on their activities has not been appropriated in the past.

In order to ensure higher sustainability for the projects, closer co-operation should be re-
launched on clear basis.

MPP should promote a new approach towards local NGOs encouraging their
involvement in programme implementation With the respect of clear and agreed
regulations. In particular, NGOs could favour the MPP direct contact with the
communities and their members, which might put the programme within the reach of
the poor people in the districts.

8. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Several conclusions and reconnnendations contained in the present evaluation were
already formulated in the 2"d MPP evaluation performed in July 1999.

In that evaluation, the consultant particularly emphasised the following:

11) The co-operation between the MPP and other actors was limited, especially with
district ofﬁcers, NGOs and other projects at the ﬁeld level. More intensive
relationship should be researched by all the actors involved in social and economic
development.

a) Efforts had to be made in order to achieve a more decentralised approach for MIU
management towards regional ofﬁces.

b) The MIU should experiment with new approaches to more systematic planning,
ensuring at the same time a bottom-up approach.

c) Strategies for implementing an adequate ﬁling system and monitoring and
evaluation system were suggested.

d) Project appraisal forms were used to assess technical issues rather than to focus on
the social and economic dynamics of the target group, or on gender balance and
involvement

.e) Increased communication between the MPP and district ofﬁcials, NGOs, and
communities in the project identiﬁcation phase was suggested (with particular care
paid to social dynamics).

f) The EC delegation should promote a more active co-operation among EDF
programmes.

g) Construction of new health facilities should not be undertaken without a clear and:
written corrnnitment of responsibilities.

Many of these aspects were not considered designing the ﬁnancial proposal of the 3rd
MPP. In particular, the proposal did not address programme strategy and did not specify
any particular MPP approach in keeping with the recommendations in the evaluation of
the 2nd MPP. This is because the new programme formulation was technically ﬁnalised
before the ﬁnal evaluation was completed (the 3rd MPP started in April 1999 while the
evaluation report was written in July 1999). ‘

d . . . - . .
The 3r MPP evaluation conﬁrms some of these conclusrons and recommendations in
the hope that the formulation of the 4‘h MPP will integrate these suggestions. In
particular, an increased attention of the programme toward social and economic aspects

and the adoption of a participatory approach should be included in the new programme
-.for1nulation. .   . -..   ,.   ,,  

As in the case of previous programme rounds, the 3rd MPP completed an impressive
number on micro-projects. These“ projects represent an important contribution to
[io'verty alleviation in the country, but rarely result in a direct and immediate lifting of
the poor people above the poverty line.

 

 

 

The following are the cone

 

lusions and recommendations of the current evaluation.-

1. Relevance

The MPP should continue its contribution to alleviate poverty at t

he national level. In

order to maximise programme results the MPP should:

a)

b)

2.

s, which has a direct impact on social development (in

Address its actions at factor
e the standard of

particular, those social and economic activities that can improv
living for the poor). _
Improve co-ordination with the district and assume more responsibility for the
planning and programming phases at the district level (a bilateral improvement in
communication between the development actors).

Co-ordination at the district level should be implemented with respect for the

autonomy, independence. policy, strategy and methodology of each involved actor.

Provide training for the MIU staff in order to improve their approach to the project
cycle management starting .with a deeper involvement in the need identiﬁcation
process at the community level.

Be directly involved in identifying project beneﬁciaries with the participation of
local communities and their traditional representatives. In particular, the projects
should involve the poorest people in its activities to ensure they beneﬁt from the
programme.

Modify the MPP strategy to allow direct contact with local communities and to
ensure direct communication with the programme beneficiaries.

Efﬁciency

MPP demonstrated good internal efficiency but some modiﬁcations could be made. In
particular the programme should:

a)

b)

Provide an improved monitoring and evaluation system that includes ex-ante
baseline data collection. The system should include a ﬁrst evaluation of social and
economic impacts at the community level, in particular forless advantaged groups).
Modify and optimise the MIU structure to include a new monitoring unit and
technical support for the social and economic components of programme
management.

Provide a more intensive and consistent evaluation system through periodic external
missions (every six or twelve months) in order to assist and support the programme
management in the decision making process. issues of rc-addressing and re-
orientation, as well as prOgramme co—ordination with other projects.

Expand the role and modify the composition of the Steering Committee, which
should assume a more active and integrated role. It is suggested an enlarged steering
committee that could include new social and economic actors.

 

g)

h)

a,
0.

EU participation in the steering committee and in programme implementation
should be improved in order to ensure better co-ordination between the strategy and
policy of MPP and the Cotonou agreements. -

A well defined accounting system should manage the budget allocation for project
implementation and its respect in order to avoid the overlapping of new and old
MPP budgets (including eventual modiﬁcation of the current budget).

Modify the psychology of the MIU approach to the programme, which is generally
considered to have the unlimited ﬁnancial support of the EC. There is no sense of
completion to the programme, and the overall technical and ﬁnancial management is
similar to an implementing agency instead ofa real development programme, which
is what the M PI) is supposed to be.

The new approach should lead to renew negotiations with the communities where
their real priorities are identiﬁed in co-operation with the project through a bottom-
up approach. A clear distinction between the 3rd and 4‘h MPPs is strongly
recommended in order to share the new programme strategy and policy at the
community level.

These new strategies and approaches should be used when allocating the 4‘h MPP
budget in order to maximise MPP efﬁciency and effectiveness. Old application
forms and requests coming from the 3rd MPP should be re-examined in light of a

deeper social and economic approach and eventually rc-negotiated at community

level.

Effectiveness

The MPP management and project should be in future more involved in the follow-up
of programme effects and impact. In order to ensure more effective action, the MPP

should:

a)
b)

C)
d)

e)

g)
h)

Improve its relationship with the committees that manage the project infrastructures.
Follow up and record utilisation of the micro-project output (for example,
supporting the committees in establishing their own data recording systems).
Support and assist the committees in establishing their own fund raising
methodologies. .

Identify new and more sustainable building technologies also in co-operation with
other programmes.

Optimise the contribution level of the local population including in cash
contribution from the community (especially when replacing bricks with cement
blocks and/or bore holes where local contribution is limited, and also in order to be
sure that the priority expressed by the community is a real priority).

Orient the programme toward projects sustainable at the community level,
suspending (or delaying) those where short term sustainability is not completely
achieved or tested (for example. the health centres).

Concentrate programme action on community managed projects. with the increased
and improved mediation and support of local NGOs.

Open the programme activities to community based lGA able to generate a
community income to be reinvested in local small development activities (for
example, to be reinvested in new micro-projects identiﬁed by the community itself).

b...

a

 

 

 

*Iu
-

1)

i)

k)

1)

Avoid duplications with other national programmes. reducing or cancelling MPP
action in ﬁelds already covered by other, better equipped projects (for example
national programmes for bridge and road construction managed by NRA or Public
Works Programme). Old applications should be redirected to more relevant
programmes.

New reforestation programme should be formulated linking tree planting project in
all case of serious environmental impact at village level (for example for community
halls and health centres).

Improve co-ordination between the MPP and other EU programmes in Malawi. In
particular, due to the common objective of poverty alleviation. strict and direct co-
operation should be started with the Food Sccurity Programme in order to
concentrate both programme actions in those speciﬁc areas of the country where
poverty is more acute.

As a general consideration, the MPP should Concentrate its action in areas and
regions manifesting the most serious poverty problems. The countrywide coverage
of the programme projects can in some cases reduce the optimisation of programme
effectiveness (for example for bore holes).

Sustainability

The project officers are promoting the concept of sustainability and maintenance at
village committees’ level. In order to improve the sustainable use of the completed
infrastructures, the MPP should:

a)
b)

C)
d)

e)

g)

11)

Operate in direct contact with the communities involved in a project.

Establish a direct relationship with the committees chargedlwith the repair and
maintenance of the infrastructures. .

Identify and select all the fund raising systems actually adopted in the villages.
Analyse the different fund raising systems and share the data with the villages in
order to promote the identiﬁcation of a proper system for each village.

Verify and introduce a uniform fee system (in particular. fees are often applied in
the case of bore holes. The MPP could suggest the introduction of a minimum fee of
5 MK per household per month to be used for repairs and maintenance).

The experience of collecting monthly rent from the teachers’ houses to be used for
school maintenance could be expanded to most villages participating in the MPP
projects.

Increase the feeling of ownership of the projects. Special actions should aim to
clarify agreement among the programme, community and local institutions about
their future responsibilities in managing the infrastructures -

Co-ordination between micro~projects and conununity based IGA is suggested.
Funds generated tlu'ough these economic activities could be re-invested in the
management of socio-economic infrastructures.

The reforestation programme should be also implemented as an additional income
source at community level to be used in project maintenance.

Annex 2: Terms afre ere/Ices
 MICRO PROJECT PROGRAMME III
MALAWI: 8 ACP MAI 12

Terms of Reference for a Evaluation Service Contract

According to the Lome convention the multi-annual micro-projects programmes
(MPMP) are one of the instruments of the EU/ACP development co-operation. Their
objective is the development of people's economic and social situation. in response to
the needs of local communities. The participation of local communities is outlined in
article 252 of the convention according to two main criteria: the micro-projects are to be
undertaken "at the initiative" of local communities, and these have to "contribute to
their implementation" in terms ot‘services, cash or kind.

With this spirit, the Government of Malawi ’(GoM) and the EC delegation have
implemented since 1996, three consecutive MPMP for a total amount of 27.447.738
Euros. The third ﬁnancing agreement will expire in December 2002.

The intended contract will include 3 components to be performed by the same team of
consultants:

1. Evaluation of the 3rd Micro-Projects Programme (MPP). '
2. Formulation of Financing Proposal (F P) for 4‘“ MPP to be financed under 9TH EDF.

COMPONENT I : PR OGRAAIME E VAL UA T 1 ON

1. Introduction

The Financing Agreement (FA) for the 3'.d MPP was signed on 27lh January 1999 with a
total ﬁinding of Euro 15 Millions Euro’s. The FA ceiling was raised to 18 Millions
Euro’s in February 2001. The FA will expire on 315' December 2002. The full amount
of the grant (I8 Meuro’s) will be disbursed by 30 September 2002, for the
implementation of over 1200 projects. .

The MPP interventions have been in Education, Health. Rural development and
Transport sectors including income-generating activities. These interventions respond to ‘
the needs of rural and urban communities who initiate self-help projects and contribute
25% of the total project cost. The most typical projects are school blocks, teacher’s
houses, health centres, postal agencies, bridges, the drilling of boreholes, and provision
of small loans for income generating activities.

2. Objectives of the evaluation

A programme evaluation of the Micro-ProjeCts Programme .shall be carried out after
about two years of programme implementation, it will:

 

 

“H “as.--  W.-.“ H-.. m. “a... -..__.,.  ..

o assess the relevance and the performance of the programme. its impact of the
programme on poverty alleviation among the rural and urban communities

0 review the organisational and management structure of the Micro—Projects
Implementation Unit (MlU) and advise on appropriate enhancement.

0 Advise the Steering Committee and Micro—Project Implementation Unit in policy
fonnulation for further implementation of the MPP.

The evaluation will follow the format described in this document

Further the evaluation will be the main source of information/lessons learned for
incorporation in 41“ MPP and be the basis for write—up of 21 Financing Proposal for a new
5 years programme (30 to 35 MEuro’s to be financed from 9 EDF). The Financing
Proposal will be drafted and finalised in accordance to the requirements of the EDF
committee.

The operating and contract procedures of the MIU will be reviewed and updated in
order to meet the standard EDF procedures (including Decentralised Project
Management) and in order to enhance an effective and efﬁcient implementation of the
programme.

3. Background

The third MPP is the continuation of MPP] and MPP2. In accordance with the
ﬁnancing agreement and in preparation of a new 5 year ﬁnancing agreement, the
ongoing programme need to be evaluated against the terms of the FA and in the light of
the previous evaluation report. i

The FA for third MPP is provided in annexe as well as extract from the evaluation
report of the second MPP and from the latest available quarterly report of the MPP3.
Extract from the Lome’ and Cotonou convention and guidelines for management of
decentralised projects are also provided as reference documents.

4. Issues to be studies in the evaluation.

The following issues will be analysed in order to develop conclusive statements
pertinent to the evaluation criteria : relevance. efﬁciency. effectiveness, impact and
sustainability.

Each issue should lead to a conclusive statement related to the design of MPP 4 even if

All the above have to be relative to selecting implementation strategies for the 4th MPP
planning sequence. The need for decentralisation as required by the government of
Malawi should be fully integrated in the evaluation and recommendation process.

5. Evaluation Methodology

The consultants will design an appropriate methodology to capture both quantitative and
qualitative information relevant to the programme to be collected in the ﬁeld and
ofﬁces. Speciﬁcally the consultants will incorporate the logical framework approach
focusing on:

a) Impact and sustainability link to overall objectives.

b) Effectiveness link to purpose. '

c) Efﬁciency linking means through activities up to results.

The consultant will use through his report a performance rating system which will allow

a clear understanding of the outcome of his assessment.

Annex 3: Methodology applied for the study: ﬁeld visits

Field Visits

The ﬁeld visits were realised during the first part of the mission in Malawi. Aims of the
visit were:

a) to collect direct information in the villages

b) to meet the village authorities in order to discuss the project implementation
c) to integrate the available information on the implemented projects

d) to assess preliminary effect and/or impacts generated by the MP1’

The description of the visits is divided into two main sections:

1) a general description of the projects visited including consideration on project
relevance and programme efficiency and effectiveness ’

2) a list of consideration on the impact on community development detailed according
an analysis of strength, weakness, opportunity and threats (swot) of each typology
of project.

This second section is in particular reserved to ﬁrst hand suggestions and considerations
useful for the future proposal of the 4‘“ MPP in Malawi. Therefore the section is not an
analysis of “missed” opportunities of the 3rd MPP but mainly it underlines potentiality
expressed by the communities for future programme implementations.

In particular this is conﬁrmed by the presence of some sector (agriculture) not included
in the 3rd MPP objectives that still remain a priority for many villages in the country.
The sector, for example, should be supported in the future through a more direct action
of IGA in favour of less advantaged people or to sustain community promoted

economic activities.

Furthermore, during the visits and meetings, the consultants tried to stimulate the
communities to describe their priorities besides the MPP ﬁeld of action. In this way it
has been possible to underline several potential sectors for the future intervention of the
programme. This consideration should lead to a more direct involvement of MIU in the
phase of need identification at community level.

1 Visit to Uliwa village - Karonga district (Section I)
The visit concerned ﬁve completed projects of the MP programmes:

a) The Under 5 clinics built under the 2nd MPP in 1997
b) The staff house related to USC (2"d MPP)

c) The School block renovated under 2"d Ml’l’

d) The teacher houses annexed

6)" The new bore hole drilled under the 3rd MPP

~ ~

*m...‘

g ‘ _ ‘

M

-_ _— m.  UM— ———___ ..

The visit started at the USC (closed at the time of the visit) and at the new bore hole
built by the project. At this stage the ET was able to conduct direct interviews with a
group of women using the water facilities.

In order to obtain basic information about the under live clinic. the Evaluation Team
(ET) also paid a visit to the district l-lC where the consultants met the staff in charge of .
the structure in Uliwa.

Finally, an open discussion was held with a large group of representatives of the local
community in the presence of the Head of the community.

' Relevance

The discussion with the local stakeholders will allow the ET to underline particular
aspects related to local conditions and problems.

As far as the relevance of the completed inﬁ'astructures is concerned. the ET detected
signiﬁcant correlation with the needs of the area. In particular, as underlined by the staff
of the health centre, bore holes were (and still are) required as the demand for clean
water is not satisﬁed by the water pipeline (which is also considered very expensive).

At the same time, medical services coverage in the area remains poor and the USC is
faced with an exceptional numberlof requests for monthly visits. Contrasted with the
100 visits scheduled per month, the staff accounted for as many as 300 monthly visits,
all concentrated in a single day of service (the third Thursday of each month).

Considering the population of the area (about 15,000 persons), the number of medical
staff in the district health centre (ten). the level of equipment, the lack of power supply
and lack .of access to ambulances, the ET conﬁrms that there is an opportunity here for
the MPP to contribute to improved conditions in the health sector, The ET notes that
here is still much scope for improvement. -

The micro project completed for the educational sector (renovation of a school block
and completion of housing for teachers) has probably provided more stability and
continuity to local efforts.

On the other hand, the quality of the civil work (particularly to the school) is not very
high but this is probably due to the original quality of the renovated structure.

° Efﬁciency

There is strict correlation between programme activities and expected outcome. The
long-time collaboration started under the previous Ml’l’ has allowed for a certain level
of self-management among community members. (See also the paragraph concerning

No serious problems with the programme ofﬁce were brought up by the community,
even if some peOple complained of a delay in payments from the contractor.

Furthermore, the implementation of MPP was at times affected by the delays caused by
the traditional transportation system for bricks (by oxen).

' Eﬂecliveness

As mentioned in the paragraph on programme relevance. the Uliwa programme is
contributing to face several factors affecting the living standards in the area.

The new bore hole (in operation for three weeks) combined with the bore hole
previously built by Daniela close to the village school. makes an important contribution
to water availability. . The two bore holes serve about 1.0004500 persons with an
average of 500 — 750 people per bore hole.

According to local standards suggested by the health centre. a target of 250 persons per
bore hole (within a maximum distance of 500 meters) is expected to be achieved. It is
clear that in the case of Uliwa, this target has still not been completely reached and
further improvements are expected.

Better service should also be provided at the underS clinics. The one-day opening
implies overload for the medical staff, which has to face the demand of at least nine
villages in the area. The high demand conﬁrms the importance ol’starting such a service
in Uliwa village so the initial objective of the programme can be considered achieved.

The impact of the school block in Uliwa could not be directly assessed due to the
absence of the teacher during the ET visit to the site. The programme activity was
limited to the renovation of an existing structure so probably the impact on education
indicators is quite limited. ‘

However, as mentioned above ,the school block will have to be considered a candidate
for further maintenance in future.

- Impact on communin development and crosseulling issues
° Strengths

The members of the Uliwa community made a positive impression on the ET
consrdering that:

a. Participation in the meeting was very active and people desired to communicate
their opinions.

b. The discussion was sufﬁciently free and all the participants had an opportunity to
speak.

c. Women’s participation was important (8 out of 27 persons attending the meeting

The whole community recognised the importance of women’s role in the
implementation of the works.

The community organised a committee.

A woman is responsible for the supervision of the use of the bore hole.

- Weaknesses

Parts of the discussion were inﬂuenced by
of the ET in the evaluation of MPP.

The discussion was too MPP oriented and people continued to address only the

achievement envisaged under the MPP implementation (bore holes, school blocks
etc...)

- I Threats

As underlined by the community, MPP activities during the rainy season are in
conﬂict with ﬁeld work affecting participation in the project activities.

Poverty is often assumed to be behind poor contribution to the works. The MPP
probably will have to consider the integration of 10A and micro realisation in order
to diversify and increase local contribution and participation. I
The health service’s goal for the future is to ask customers to pay for the servrces
received. A ﬁxed amount of 20 MK will probably be required to cover some
operating costs. Although this is one possible way to ensure sustainability of the
structures, it has be underlined that the introduction ofa fee could affect the demand
for the services. thus reducing social impact in the area.

Some skilled labourers complained ofa delay in their payments by the contractor.

2. Visit to Jalawc village — Rumphi District. Section 1

In Jalawe the ET visited:

a) The health centre built under 3rd MPP and still to he completed

b) The maternity centre (under progress)
c) The staff house (one completed out of three scheduled)
d) The bore hole

° Relevance

The programme’s relevance is conﬁrmed by the appreciation and agreement expressed
by the Ministry of Health with regards to the health centre. The programme actually
involves seven villages with about 10.000 people interested. -

° Eﬁ‘iciency

The project was started in May 1999 and it is not yet completed. Several problems arose
during the last months and the maternity centre in particular is facing serious delay.

At the same time, medical staff for the health centre will not be assigned until the
completion of the civil works. -

The programme must manage to ﬁnd a quick and permanent solution to the problem as
soon as possible.

3. Visit to Malivenji Village - District of Mzuzu Section 1

The programme completed the following projects:

nd
a) Two school blocks (under the 2 MPP in 1998 and the third M Pl’ in 2000)
b) Two teachers’ houses (2""MPP in 1997)

In addition, the villages have two schools‘they

built themselves which are not in good
condition.

 

' Relevance

The two school blocks are used by eight villages with an estimated population of 5,000
persons. The structures cover a real need in the area and it seems that more school
blocks are required (probably by renovating the existing infrastructure)

- Efﬁciency

As is the case for other micro-projects, the programme can be considered efﬁcient but
the community complained about the average pay for skilled labour (MK 30,000 per
building) which does not meet the market labour cost.

The wages paid to skilled labour could give in the future some problems to MPP if the
offer is too low compared to other programmes. This was a specilic option of the MPP
that should be carefully evaluated the future.

Contribution was real and shared among the villages who prepared 20.000 bricks each.
According to the community members attending the meeting (twenty men and three
women), women and men shared the work equally (even though women are assigned
the transportation of brick, sand and water which is the physically'most demanding

work).

The commturity underlined some delays in the reforestation project which caused the
loss of many trees ( 3”I MPP provided 1,000 trees. 300 of which survive). '

' Ejﬁcliveness

The school blocks are used by 558 pupils (279 are girls) and pupils share eight
classrooms. The average number of pupils per class is 70. which is really very high
considering the poor condition of the blocks.

According to the teachers, the enrolment rate increased by 75% with the two new MPP
school blocks (the second school is still waiting for furniture) while the annual drop-out-
rate is very low (about 1-2 % per year).

The teachers‘ housing is fully occupied and the community remarked on their
importance, asking for more houses to make sure ofthe teacher presence in the area.

’IG - . . . . u n
In order to increase proiect impact in the community. several sectors are indicated by
priority:

1) Bore holes for drinking water (in particular a supply to the school)

2) New teachers‘ housing and a head master‘s ofﬁce

3) New school blocks complete with furniture ,

4) A dispensary or health facilities (the closest facility is l 1 km away in Mzuzu)

- Relevance

The villagers indicated the school as their ﬁrst priority many times. They declared
themselves to be very satisﬁed with the school blocks and ready to build two new
buildings. The bore hole is not operating and it does not actually meet the school
requirement.

' Efﬁciency

The community appreciated the programme’s readiness to start the work after the
project approval.

Contributions involved the whole community which worked hard to satisfy the
requirements. In this community as well, the members attending the meeting (twelve
men and two women) declared that women and men shared the work equally.

The school is serving an area with a population of about 22,000 people.

The community complained in particular about the work done during the rainy season.
The area is accessible only by a narrow dirt road which created many difﬁculties for

b. Women are managing the school committee.

c. Many volunteers are teaching'in the school (seven volunteers helping the three state
teachers.)

- Weaknesses

a. The drop—out rate is stable even if not exactly quantiﬁed. It is important to underline
that the drop-out rate because of pregnancy is seen as lower than before.

b. The committee does not have a ﬁxed budget for repairs and maintenance, but
collects money only if some damage has occurred. '

c. The bore hole has not been working for the last three months due to a shortage of
minor spare parts in Nkata Bay.

d. The community did not~ participate in a reforestation project although wood
consumption for brick—making is very high.

' Opportunities

a. The commtmities belong to the Tonga ethnic group and seem to be sure about their
priorities (“they don’t want to wait for anybody” to do things).

b. The area population is high and the requirements very clear.
Two persons started their own reforestation business planting more than 7,500 trees.
The combination of care for the environment and micro—business (sale of wood)
seems to offer an interesting opportunity for the future of MPP in this ﬁeld.

6. Mwaya F.P. School — Nkata Bay district Section 1

The community was attending a funeral so the meeting was held only with the teachers
of the school (eight men plus one woman acting as the school secretary).

The MPP completed two teachers’ houses at the school (in 1997 and 1998 under the 2nd
MPP). Furthermore. they have applied for a school block.

The schools (three with a total of eight classrooms) serve villages (Chibako, Chalomba,
Tchibunya, Malenga sanga and Chawa)
° Relevance

The demand for teachers’ housing is still very high and six teachers are living in
temporary situation. There is also a need for a new school block.

The community participated in the work as other villages did (making bricks, carrying
stones, providing water and sand).
- Efficiency

The latrines of the houses are not working properly. No other remarks for the MPP.

° Effectiveness

Many problems still remain in the highly populated area. The work on the teachers’
housing seems to be only the ﬁrst step.

The teachers stated the following priorities for the future:

Potable water (ﬁrstly for the school)

One school block in order to replace an existing school that is damaged.
A secondary school (actually there is one more than l5 km away.)

A library with furniture (and books from the Ministry) for the school

7. St. Francis Parish Area 25 — Lilongwe District Section 2

The project built a community hall and a second building used as a training centre. The
hall is managed by the community through a committee and the parish is also a

member.

The administration of the hall and the centre will supported by Cestas. an Italian NGO,
until next year.

Relevance

0-;
.

The parish and the hall are located in a highly populated area. As a matter of fact, the
presence of the parish and the NGO does not allow tor a complete appreciation of the
process of sensibilisation ofthe community.

The activities held (computer, tailoring, journalism. music and so on) are mainly
managed by these partners and all of them are very successful. Some problems
occurred with the tailoring courses when participants didn’t understand that the output
of the job belonged to the parish.

During the civil works, the youth of the area collected 12.000 MK while the community
as a whole contributed lOO~000 MK to buy bricks.

' Efﬁciency

Due to the high number of users, the system selected for the toilets seems not working
properly and the parish is thinking to build a new type oflatrines.

All other subjects shoald be discussed with the representative of the NGO who was not
available during the visit.

' Effectiveness

It is difﬁcult to underline the effect of the hall due to the strong co-operation of the
parish and the management of the NGO.

The parish also displayed some doubt about the economical sustainability of the hall
(used seven days per week with an average cost of l3.000 MK per month due to
electricity and water consumption plus the rent ol' the land that is paid to the
municipality).

According to the use of the structure the hall seems to be continuously occupied for
several activities (also marriages on payment of 7, 000 MK). I

Many students attend the training courses and pay regularly tuition fees (from 500 to
1,000 MK for each semester).

The CESTAS representative were not in Lilongwe during the mission and the expected
meeting was cancelled.

8. Bembeke CDSS — Dezda District Section 3

The programme completed two school blocks (one in 1997 under the l“.l MPP and one
in 1999 under the 2"d MPP). Furthermore, a teacher‘s house was built in 1999 under the
3'd MPP. '

- Relevance

The secondary school was a “great requirement”. It covers an area of 25 villages with an
estimated population of 10,000 persons.

The contribution involved about 160,000 bricks for the two schools (plus sand and
stones) and 130,000 bricks for the teacher’s house (the bricks were prepared also for
other teachers’ houses to be built in the future).

The villages worked one week each and women contributed most of the labour (men
were “only baking bricks). 

The school committee has established a development fund of 20 MK per student, but
the money is not enough for repairs and maintenance (about 30,000 MK per year
required).

- Eﬁiciency

The community was informed about the project by the Area Development Committee
and then they met with the District Development Fund. The community applied to the

District Commissioner’s ofﬁce.

The parish that was managing the area at the time took the ﬁnal decision on the school.

' Eﬂctivcnesr

The school has a very high drop-out rate due to a tuition increase (266students ﬁnished

last year against an initial enrolment of375 students of which 154 were girls). Expected
enrolment for next year is 300 students.

9. Kazcmbe Area — Zomba District Section 3

The ET visited two bore holes named Kazembe 1 and 2 serving respectively 70 and 80
households for an estimated population of 1,200 persons.

Both committees conﬁrmed that water was (and in some cases still remains) the main
problem in the village.

Contribution was in kind and both committees declared that the whole village took part
in the work.

It should be noted that due to a delay in the scheduled visit. to Kazembe 1, it was only
possible to meet two men but more than 20 women who arrived as soon as the ET came
to the bore hole. At Kazembe 2 more than 20 women (three of them on the committee)
and no men were available for discussion. '

The decision-making process was partially inﬂuenced by lnterAid who promoted the
drilling of wells and bore holes in the area. Both committees feel that the decision is
their own and all the women are very proud of their work.

' Eﬁciencjr

Some remarks were made at Kazembe 1 (both bore holes are similar but quite different
from the majority ofMPP structures). In particular:

a. Improper drainage of water from the bore hole site (made more complicated
by the brick fence built all around).
b. The bore hole is difﬁcult to clean.

0. A certain quantity of water is lost due to the distance of the pipe from the.
saws which are built on cement.

' Effectiveness

The committees appreciated the water quality (before they were using a stream and a
small river close to the village)

Furthermore, the two bore holes reduced the distances and time for fetching water. Both

committees underlined that diarrhoea and cholera decreased after they started using the
bore holes.

Impact on community development and crosscutting issues
- Strengths

a. The two bore holes allowed women to obtain a new position in the community (and
they declare themselves to be satisﬁed to have achieved this important role).

' Opportunities

a. Due to interest generated by the bore holes money collection could be increased in
the short term.

b. The women are assuming a new role in the community and they are demanding
economic support for agricultural activities (especially for food production).

- Threats

a. The MPP could consider the project completed.

Men and women should be supported to work together for community development.

10. Thombora — Zomba District Section 3

The village has a new school block in cement brick under construction (3rd MPP). On

the same site (just in front of the EU school block), MASAF is building a second block
in red bricks.

Ten persons attended the meeting (three of which were women on the school
committee).

MASAF started its work in April 200]. while EU began in June 2001. According to the
programme ofﬁcer the village was assigned only the EU school.
In total four classrooms are under construction.

The schools face a shortage ofinfrastructures in the area.

The only school actually available is the traditional once (with ﬁve classes) which is in
poor conditions. -

The villages (ﬁve with a population of about 4,000 persons) formed a school committee
in 1997 before the beginning of the civil work to underline the priority 01' their chorce.

The community leaders learned about both projects from the Community Development
Assistant (CDA) and decided two submit two applications (both approved).

The decision making process started with a meeting of the ﬁve village Head men who
decided by themselves to select the school block among all the potential micro prolects.

All the villages had to contribute. Contributions were in bricks. sand, stones (on
payment) and water for the MASAF project while due to a shortage of wood for brick

preparation, they contributed to the EU project witli'a rotation among the villages to
collect sand for the cement bricks.

The work took three months and women formed the majority of the labour force.

' Efficiency

Even though EU started two months later, the EU school block is close to c

ompletion
The members of the community underlined the following differences:

~ Opportunities

The villages are facing problems with the scarcity of health facilities (long distance
to the closest hospital in Msamama, 15-18 km) '

were presentalthough the women did not respond to any questions.)

The visit concerned two school blocks (one completed in 1996 under the lst MPP and

built in 1997 (lSl MPP).

In the same period two more buildings were provided by GOPA (Germany) and IDA

while MASAF built the road through the village. The villages did not contribute to these
works.

«Ii

- Relevance

The community is lbrmed by ﬁve villages (population is estimated-at 7.000 — 8.000
people).

The information about MPP came directly from the l-leadman of the village who knew
about the EU. The community leaders informed the villages about the project as well as
the contribution required and the Headinan applied to the District Commissioner.

The Headmen of the villages said that they had to deal with some complaints about the

work contribution . but the whole process was managed internally without external
assistance. "

As in other villages, the leaders recognise that “women worked more than men”.

They established a School Committee (three women among nine members), a Parent
Teacher Association (four women among nine) and a Building Committee.

The Community leaders also said that they applied for bore holes (there is only one
functioning bore hole for the ﬁve villages) but without response so far.

° . Eﬂiciency

The latest school block is built in cement brick due to the shortage of trees in the area.
Work was very slow due to a delay in delivering material.

The school has nine teachers and six teachers’ houses

° E17ectivencss

The school enrolment is increasing with a total of 850 pupils last year (349 girls) but
With a very high drop out rate (only 759 ﬁnished school at the end of the year).

 



Girls are more likely to drop out due to lack of interest in the school or due to parents’
decision to withdraw them and employ them in the ﬁeld.

The Parent Teacher Association tries to deal with this problem by informing the
families as soon as children abandon the school but the results seem to be very poor.

' Impact on c'n/mnunily developmcnl and crossculling issues
'  trengths

a. The community knows that is directly responsible for the school.

b. The School Committee found an original solutionto raising funds for repairs and
maintenance: the nine teachers pay a monthly rent for their houses of 100 MK and
the money is used for minor repairs.

' Weaknesses

a. The community switched from red brick to cement due to scarcity of trees, but they
are promoting tree planting in the villages. On the other hand, individual tree
- planting for business purposes has been started.
b. There could be a lack of communication about the bore hole application. The
programme officer decided to check if the application actually arrived at the EU.

- Opportunities

a. The community asked if the EU could support a church renovation. This is the ﬁrst
time during a field visit that a real need is expressed which is outside the standard
MPP projects. More meetings should be organised to discuss with the communities
and to better assess the needs that could strengthen the community development.

b. The community asked for a bicycle to improve communication among the villages
and a hall (also intended as a means for fund raising in the area).

- Threats

a. The villages in the Mioho area are also facing food security problems. In particular,
they claim that there was enough rain but soil fertility is decreasing in a signiﬁcant
way. No crop rotation or manure is applied (only a few villages apply organic
animal fertilisers ). They require assistance with fertilisers.

The decision to build the bridge and share the contribution was not easy because at the
beginning several villages did not appreciate the utility of a bridge.

Once the problems were solved, all the villages contributed by rotation (20 persons at a
time) by collecting stones for the bridge construction from a hill close to the site. The

men broke the stone manually (with other stones) and the women carried them to the
bridge). .

- Efficiency

The building of the bridge took one year. Some materials arrived late and during the

rainy season the work progressed very slowly. (Some leaders complained of delays also
during the dry season.)

' Effectiveness

The “area is like an island”. The community likes to deﬁne themselves as people closed
into an area with very difficult access.

The bridge undoubtedly contributes to better cOmmunication in the area and it solved
many problems with getting to the other side of the river.

The trucks of the middlemen can cross the bridge and serve the whole area and the

villages (sometimes overloaded truck can also damage the bridge). The introduction of
the infrastructure offers better access to the market.

The area is under tobacco cultivation with a large factory dominating the local market.
Prices were not inﬂuenced by the improved access and almost all the farmers are
obliged to produce on credit with 57 % interest to be paid when they deliver their

12. Cliikondc CDSS — Mwanza District Section 3

The Chiltonde Secondary School serves 20 villages with an estimated population of
more than 20.000 persons.

The 3rd MPP has built two school blocks (2000 and 2001) both in cement blocks.

- Relevance

Also in this community the headman learned about MPP through the radio which was
describing other projects.

There were many primary schools in the area and at ﬁrst the secondary school was
temporarily housed in one of these schools. . .
In 1999 the secondary school had to move and the community applied for four school

blocks and two teachers’ houses.

A group of ﬁve headmen established a school committee (four women among nine
members, the number suggested by the Government) and called the community for a
general meeting. The decision was largely approved and the ﬁve headmen decided how
to share the contribution among the involved villages (some of them had to bring stones
while others were carrying sand).

Women had an important role both‘in participating in the decision and in the work
(water and sand transportation).

° Efficiency

The second school block is still to be completed. The ﬁrst school was built in only nine
months but desks have not been delivered. The place is in a remote area difﬁcult to be
reach even by truck.

° Effectiveness

The four classes in the school are serving 308 students (110 of them are girls) with 20
students dropping out last year (75% were girls who left because ot'pregnancy).

The second reason for chopping out is the enrolment fee increase imposed by the
government.

l

 

 

The fees increased by 360 MK (60 MK x 3 terms plus 180 MK for the books) to 1.750
MK per year (including 250 MK for Text Books Revolving Funds). The village
received a 100% contribution towards the books from Danida.

The teachers at the school are expecting about 300 students next year including some
who dropped out and will reapply.

The eight teachers do not have their own houses at the school site but they live in
nearby villages.

' Impact (117 00171177111717 y development and crossculli17g issues

' Strengths

a. The community understands its own responsibility for the school.
The Headmen are responsible for raising funds for repairs and maintenance and they
ask the villagers to contribute to the costs when they occur (from a minimum of 5
MK to a maximum of 30 MK for people with a gross salary including teachers of
the school, while skilled labourers co-operate by working free of charge). -
c. The MPP introduced individual money contribution to the projects for the ﬁrst time

in the area the (previously the villagers contributed only in kind towards a school
block).

- Weaknesses

a. Sometimes it is difﬁcult to collect money from the villages for the school
maintenance (they need 3.000 MK per year for repairs and about 9.600 MK for the
watchman); the villagers do not understand why they have to pay for a government
school.

b. The state collects fees but does not cover any local costs of the school.

The site is quite far from the main road (from Blantyre to Mwanza).

' Opportunities

a. The community is asking for more infrastructures and is ready to contribute.

b. Possible ﬁelds of co-operation are drilling a bore hole for the school, building
teachers’ houses, providing health care, improving the access road (a bridge is
required).

c. Women asked for a food security project and IGA.

m-..“

~-~--——- ..

- Threats

a. If the community is overloaded with new projects there is a risk that the villagers
will reject responsibility (in particular for sharing maintenance costs).

b. Furthermore, there are another two blocks on the site (a village-built ofﬁce
constructed with ﬁnancial contribution from of DDF and a school block by IDA)
and the costs seem not sustainable for the community.

13. Neno DEC — Mwanza District Section 3 I

Only the members of the school committee attended the meeting in Neno DEC (three
men and three women).

The programme built a school block in 1992 (with the l“1 MPP) and two teachers’
houses in cement block (2”d MPP in 1996 and 1997). There is also a school block built
by IDA on the same site

- Relevance

The secondary school provides services for 26 villages and a very large population (not
quantiﬁed, probably more than 25.000 people). '

Interest in the school decreased after the introduction of the new fees (see above).

° Eﬂiciency

The community found out about the project from the District which gave them the form,

helped them to ﬁll it in and sent the form to EU ofﬁce. The school committee members
have never been to the EU ofﬁce.

The ﬁnal decision to apply for a school block was taken during a meeting when the
community decided to ask for four schools. The women declared they had participated
actively in the decision.

The District also explained the procedure for contributions. The villages provided brick
for the old school block, but for the teachers’ houses they brought sand for lack of fuel.

' Effectiveness

As mentioned above the school is expecting a serious drop-out problem caused by the
new fees.

 

Last year 208 students (67 girls) attended the'courses and five girls dropped out due to
pregnancy. According to the teachers, enrolment has in general been decreasing during

the last few years.

I”
a.

[mpac/ 017 com/miniry develop/Hen! um! L'I'r).\'.\'cu/lil1g issues

- Strengths

The teachers pay 75 MK for the rent of the biggest house and 50 MK for the other
one.

A development fund of 20 MK per student has been created.

A general purpose fund (only for education) of 50 MK per student was agreed on

among teachers and parents.
- Weaknesses

The instability of the teachers’ living conditions: only four out of seven have their
own houses so they must live in villages far from the school.
The government fee is in addition to many other fees.

° Opportunities

The community requires further improvements in water availability. The teachers
say that the‘26 villages are served by only one bore hole and that people drink river
and stream water.

Access to the site is very poor and some of the villages are isolated during the rainy
season (by the Chikonde river).

Other problems concern the distance to the maize mill (10 km), the absence of
medical services (there is a user-pay health centre at a mission close to the school
but the majority of the villagers cannot sustain the fee), the lack of an assembly hall.

' Threats

Real development in the area would be possible by improving the access road and
building new bridges. Any delay in this lield will have consequences for other
projects.

The impact of the new fees 'on secondary school enrolment should be better
evaluated in the future, but there is a risk that the fees limit enrolment.

Several organisation (at least eight governmental and non-governmental ones)

14 . Mombezi Bridge — Mwombwc — Chiradlzulu District Section 4
The bridge on the Mombczi river was completed on .lune 2001 under the 3"" MPP.

In the same area the ET visited a bore hole drilled in 1996 and a teacher's house built in
1997 both under the lSI MPP.

' Relevance

The Mombezi bridge links two important areas previously divided by the river. The
bridge offers the opportunity to drastically reduce the walking distance among villages
and facilitates truck passage. ‘

Thirteen villages beneﬁt from the bridge but only six were directly involved in
contributing to the civil works. The bridge is new. made from stone and cement but it
has not been used for economic activities so far. ‘

As underlined by the community (ten men and no women) the bridge was a real need
for the isolated villages. ‘ V

- Efficiency

The decision to build the bridge was promoted by the group village headman who knew
about MASAF but at that time had no knowledge of the EU programme (they learned
about the EU through a school block built in a nearby village.

The application for the bridge construction was submitted to MASAF in 1999 (no
response) and to EU in 2000. The infrastructure was completed in less than one year.

The bore hole from MPP had several minor breakdowns (at least twice a year) mainly
due to plastic components. No spare part problems were mentioned.

' Effectiveness "

The bridge is actually rarely used for economic activities because of the scarcity of
goods to be sold In this period. Furthermore, it has not yet seen its ﬁrst rainy season.

However, the bridge provides good transportation for people and vehicles, and it seems
appropriate for provrdmg access to district roads (villagers underlined that they know
ambulances can cross the river without problem).

 

r— —~ -— u. ‘— II. B~

The teachers’ house contributes to dealing with a wide-spread problem of housing
scarcity for teachers. So far only four out ofsix teachers have a house a the school site.

The bore hole satisfies the water need of the surrounding four villages (about 2,000
persons) who were previously using river water.

The headman ol~ the village said that a decrease in water related diseases has been

recorded after the introduction of the bore hole water (A second bore hole was built by
MASAF in 200i ).

15. Thumbwc —- Chirandzulu District — Section 4

The ET visited the health centre under construction (3“ MPP).

' Rcleilblit‘c'

The health centre will serve an area of 52 villages and a population of probably more
than 100,000 persons. The closest hospital is 25 km away from the site and the only
medical care is provided by an USC built by MASAF in 1999.

The decision to have a health centre was a long time priority. It was promoted in 1974
and later re-proposed to MASAF and MPP.
- Efficiency

The moulding and preparation of bricks was shared among the villages who sent more
than 40 persons each at a time. '

Some delays in the civil works were pointed out due to problems in relations with the
contractor (delay of payments, the skilled labourers were not paid in October and
November due to difﬁculties with the bank).

17 . NABW Blantyre — IGA

NABW started its collaboration with MPP in 1997 with a Micro Credit Facilities for
Women (MCF W) fund of 10.0 million MK. The fund was distributed in ten districts
(two in the north and four in the centre and in the south of the country respectively).

In April 2001. NABW also started to operate a Fixed Assets Programme (FAP) with a
new fund of 8.0 million MK. This fund was only used for assets while the buildings (i.e.
for maize mill) were built with local contribution.

FAP was also used to buy boats for the villagers in the area of Nkata Bay close to the

lake.

° Relevance

NABW has more than 15,000 women members in the organisation. The maximum
credit for MCFW is 10,000 per group (from ﬁve to eight women) which has to be
reimbursed in one year with an interest of 40 % (the banks charge 57 %).

 credit is not given to the beneﬁciaries, but NABW buys the required items
directly. The reimbursement process should last‘two years.

In both cases, NABW asks a 20 % deposit in the group account which can be freely
used also during the period of the loan.

NABW charges 14% in operational costs on the total amount of the fund.

The ET visited the maize mill at BCA hill, the dairy project in Misesa and the lime
project in Lirangwe. _

' EfﬁCiCIHZV

NABW appears to be efﬁcient with a wide-spread network in the country. They have

' Strengths

a. NABW has a well-managed relationship with the members. They are very proud to
belong to the organisation and wish to improve further.

b. The organisation is well structured in the districts and seems to take an appropriate
approach. _

c. Loans and credits have indirect impacts on the communities trough the services
provided (i.e. maize mills).

d. Loans cover a large number of diversiﬁed economic activities: maize andlime mills,
dairy ﬁrms. poultry and eggs production, boats for ﬁshing and transport in the lake
area, bakery. tailoring and in particular for MCF W small trading.

- Weaknesses

a. Due to diffusion in the ﬁeld and the decreasing value of the local currency, the

agreed operational costs do not match the real costs. -

b. The funds allocated in 1997 were completely reimbursed in 2000. NABW submitted

a ﬁnal report to MPP (also to Brussels), but so far they do not know what to do with
the money available which is actually blocked in the bank.

The hall is located on the premises of the Capuchin Mission in area 49 of Lilongwe
City.

The building was completed in 1999 under the 3“| MPI’ and it is the only one available
in an area with about 360. 000 habitants.

- Relevance

The community and the church have developed strict co-operation towards social
development in the area. There is a general shortage of social services and the hall has
became an important structure both for religious institutions and for the local
community.

So far the two major social components (mission and community) have found a well
balanced way to co-operate in providing management and maintenance.

' Eﬁiciency

The completion of the hall was quite rapid because part of the foundation was already
available. Community participation was consistent with regards to continued promotion
and the religious requirements. ‘
Because of the hall new activities have been developed (for orphans in particular; also
summer school when the hall is divided into several classrooms by means of wooden
panels.)

' Eﬂectivcness

Participation in the activity at the hall is high, especially during the summer school. The
community itself has, developed a maintenance and repairs system (5.500 MK/month)
plus recurrent cost coverage based on fee payments (2,000 MK per term x 200
students). The fees also cover the costs of 13 teachers (5.000 MK/month). Furthermore
marriage ceremonies contribute money to the ﬁnancial management of the hall.

l9. Lipiri Post Agency — Down District Section 2

Although there is a long story behind the postal agency in Lipiri, it is not yet

The 22 villages interested in the postal agency started to organise themselves about 20
years ago (1983). They began to build an ofﬁce but the district obliged them to destroy
it and to respect the national building code (1990). ‘

Later, they obtained authorisation from the concerned post ofﬁce and the villages

started to look for donors to support the agency. In 1997 they contacted MASAF but at
the end of the year they applied to MPP.

The main building was almost completed by August 1998 with a contribution of ten
bucks per family (built or bought) in the 22 villages. At that point a shortage of water
