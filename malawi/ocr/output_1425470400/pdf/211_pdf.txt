~.1. SUMMARY 1
. Malawi’s road infrastructure has suffered from declining expenditure on road maintenance in recent years V

and much is now in a deteriorated state. The poor condition of the road.network meanshigher costs for all
road users and for all producers and consumers dependent on road transport services. Farmers in rural ‘areas '
deprived of accessibility have suffered. most acutely. ' ‘ ‘

I .While the road network has been left largely unmaintained, road trafﬁc has been left largely uncontrolled.

This has had two particular consequences: a road safety record that is amongst the worst in the world; and
overlOaded heavy vehicles that have accelerated the deterioration of road pavements weakened by lack of
maintenance;

‘ The problems of insufﬁcient ﬁnancing and managerial and institutional weaknesses have been recognised _

and the response has been to embrace the Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI). The essence of this strategy is

r institutional reform irryolvingthé:_commercialisatioh of roads. The ﬁrst formal step in this process has been

taken with the passing of an Act of Parliament which establishes a National Roads Authority with a
dedicated Road Fund. . i . t '

The ﬁrst steps in institutional reform have been supported through the EDF with the ﬁnancing of _a
coordinating secretariat and consultancy studies to draw up a blueprint for the reform process. EDF ftmding
has also been providing support for other road sector projects. Other donors indicating a willingness to
support the reform process and assist in addressing the backlog of road maintenance work once the reforms .
are in place include the World Bank and KNV. ' -

The overall objective of the reform programme is the good and sustainable management of roads and road
trafﬁc. The key component of the proposed project is the institutional reform package which will establish
the newly created institutions on a sustainable basis. The two main institutions are the National Roads

. Authority (NRA) and a Central Roads Agency (CRA). The Authority will be a small supervisory body with

a Board onwhich all stakeholders are represented. The Agency will be responsible at an operational level

but will procure rOad maintenance services ﬁom the private sector under contract. A training programme" is . ‘

proposed to assist the consulting and contracting ‘sectorsexpand capacity to meet the opportunities ‘-
demands that increased and assured ﬁnancing of road maintenance will bring. . ‘ '
For the new arrangements to be sustainable external support will be needed to assist in clearing the backlog
of road maintenance and rehabilitation work to put the network into a maintainable condition. This proposal
provides for a contribution to the ﬁnancing ’of backlog maintenance work to protect previous EDF
investments. ' . _ » . - ' ' v '
It, also includes a trafﬁc management component to address-the issues of road safety and vehicle weight C

‘ control. Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to help establish the NRA and CRA and make them
_ both operational and sustainable. v ~ ' ' ‘

The programme is scheduled to last three‘years. It would be implemented through the NRA, whose chief i i

- executive ofﬁcer would be the main administrator. ~ «

The estimated cost of the programme is 17.4 MECU, of which 3 MECU will" be provided ,ﬁom unspent ,

balances under Malawi’s 6th EDF National Indicative Programme (NIP), the balance from its 8th EDF NIP.. '  “ ,

2. INTERVENTION I

2.1,. Overall Objective , . I ' V . . ..

Transport is a service sector. , High transport costs and poor accessibility are barriers to economic
development. Primary aims of transport policy are to lower and remove these barriers. On a poorly
maintained road network, transport costs are higher than on a well maintained one. ImproVed road
maintenance thus implies lower transport costs (and reduced travel prices for passengers). All this translates

.into an overall project objective of good and sustainable management Of roads and road trafﬁc. “Secure and

sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources may be regarded as implicit. This overall objective is moreover clearly spelt
out in the 8th EDF National Indicative Programnie agreed between the European Community and the

g Republic of Malawi in March 1997.

2.2. Project Purpose

t

The selected strategy for achieving good and sustainable management of roads and road trafﬁc is the  ’

implementation of institutional reform. The purpose of this project is to implement part of a larger
programme of measures designed to improve the chances of sustainability. Other parts of the programme
will be supported by World Bank, KM and possibly other donors. While institutional reform is at the heart

\ , Private sector support

. ' i v .

of the reform process, three other components are proposed as part of the support. These are complementary
inputs'which will contribute to the good and sustainable management of roads and road trafﬁc. The four

» components and their separate purposes are set out below.

 

Project Component Project Purpose e V .
7 Institutional reform Establish revised Organisational structure and reformed road
management institutions-

Irnprove private sector capacity and participation.

Provide for I better performance of speciﬁed trafﬁc
management functions. '

Partial clearance of backlog of road maintenance work.

\

Private sector support

Backlog maintenance

 

2.3. Results . , _

The highest level result will be achieved for the complete programme of road maintenance support and
institutional reform - i.e. including all activities proposed under this and complementary donor projects, At
this level the expected results are a reduction in road transport costs and the lowering of transport barriers.
This could, ultimately, lead to an annual cost savings of -45 MECU in reduced transport costs. ,

The principal result of the institutional reform process will be the establisMent and stafﬁng of two new .
institutions: a National Roads Authority and a Central Roads Agency. Functions currently performed by the

’ MoWS and its Road Department will be transferred to the new institutions which will become fully

operational during the project period. Road maintenance work will be performed under contract by the ,-
private sector. These and other sub-programme results are set out in the folloWing table:

 

Project Results ' . '

Autonomous National Roads Authority (NRA) and Central ROad's Agency
(CRA) established, staffed, equipped . and operational; NRA includes a
dedicated Road Fund with secure and independent income; mechanisms in
place for effective and efﬁcient contacting out of maintenance works.
Contracting and consultant industry training programmes undertaken and
effective in boosting capacity.

Project Component
Institutional reform

Axle load control. Weighbridge stations reconstructed and re—equipped;
- responsibility for vehicle weight control transferred to NRA.
Roadsafety Safety aspects given due consideration in road works; I ,
Works at selected accident black spots undertaken. ‘ _
Backlog maintenance Initial tranche of backlog ~ of road maintenance work prepared, let,

 

 

supervised and successfully completed.

 

’ r 2.4. Activities

2.4.1. Institutional Reform. . . f I ' ,
Once the legal and ﬁnancial formalities for the establishment of the  and CRA-have been fully.
completed, the implementation phase will focus on the stafﬁng and equipping of the new institutions.

' Simultaneously, internal systems and procedures and external relationships will have to be developed to

ensure that the institutions function effectively. 'Once the principal ofﬁcers of the two institutions have been
appointed the outline programmes given in the agreed Master Plan in Annex 2 will have to be developed in
greater detail and tasks assigned to individuals. ; ~ ' V \

Technical assistance is the main item in the proposed external support. This will provide the necessary
managerial, ﬁnancial and technical expertise to support the senior ofﬁcers in developing systems and

procedures for the new institutions. A staff training component is included to ensure that skills gaps can be

closed to leave sustainable and functioning organisations at the end of programme period.

2.4.2. Private Sector Support

Technical assistance is planned to assist in establishing and running a training implementation unit, which it
is proposed should operate ﬁom the present MoWS Training Centre in Lilongwe. The principal activity will

be the delivery of training programmes for contractors and consultants and for the technical staff of the
Central Roads Agency. » '

.-.--

. accident black spots.

spot improvement works at 30-40 accident black-spot sites.

A pilot training course delivered as part of the support consultancy studies showed a very positive response
from the private sector to the opportunities provided. It conﬁrmed the need for skills development if the
private sector is to deliver the quantity and quality of work which will be demanded under the contracting-
out policy once there is assured ﬁnancing from the Road Fund. Contractors’ representatives have made it
clear that they are prepared to pay for training, provided that the work is available to enable them to deploy _
the skills acquired. The three-year training programme has been designed to deliver training to sufﬁcient
small and medium-sized contractors and consultants to enable them to meet the expecteddemand for “semi-
mechanised” maintenance work, i.e. all those tasks which fall between routine labour-only and the more
complex operations which are best performed by more plant-intensive methods. »

2.4.3. Axle Load Control , , ' _
The reconstruction and re-equipping of weighstations is the main activity in the vehicle weight control
component. Eight permanent stations and three mobile units are planned.

2.4.4. Road Safety - ' i ' ~ I

A speciﬁc responsibility foreseen for the NRA is to liaise with the National Road Safety Council to ensure
that road safety criteria are fully considered in road design and in road works. Training will be provided to
the staff of the NRA-and CRA so that they are able to fulﬁl their obligations in this regard. 30-40 road safety
improvements schemes, to be identiﬁed by reference to accident statiStics for 1997-99, will be undertaken at
2.4.5. 'Backlog Maintenance - , ‘
Five sections of road, which have beneﬁted from previous EDF support, have been identiﬁed as priority
targets for overdue periodic maintenance under the present programnm. These roads are identiﬁed in Annex
5. Residual funding, if any, will be used to reduce the backlog maintenance on other priority roads.

' ’ 3. IMPLEMENTATION

3.1. Physical and NonaPhysical Means , ~ * . p .

Those items concerning technical assistance, and related equipment, supplies and training not covered under
the present Financing Agreement are covered under the separate Financing Agreement concluded for an
amount of 3 MECU and funded from 'Malawi"s 6th EDF National Indicative Programme '
3.1.1. Infrastructure ' - “ I _

Five road sections have been identiﬁed which have previously been supported by EDF ﬁnance and which
are overdue periodic maintenance (rescaling). Some will require only very minor repairs aCcompanyingthe ‘
rescaling, others Will require more remedial work as a preliminary to surface treatment and resealing.In
physical terms the civil works component comprises 276 km of resealing of which 173 km with  minor .
patching, 93 km with more substantialwremedial works, 10 km in urban areas-with additional works; and
seven weighstations to be constructed/r¢¢onstructed (work on an eighth is already in hand as part of the EDF. ’,
ﬁnanCed Limbe Thyolo project) + similar site works as bases for three mobile units; a pilOt programme of 1

3. 1.2. Equipment

, The vehicle-weight-control programme includes equipment for seven permanent weighstations, and'vehicl’es. ~ '

and portable platforms for three mobile units.
3.1.3. Services

:The private-sector training componentprovides for 40 man-months of external input for the. ﬁrst two years

of the programme.

3.2. Organisation and Procedures : ' .
Implementation of all'components of the institutional reform programme will .be the responsibility of the
NRA. The Authority was established by Act of Parliament on 9 May 1997. The Board of the Authority is.
non-executive and its composition, as established intheAct, represents the interests of both stakeholders and
Government, with the former in the majority. The Board of the Authority will be supported by a small
secretariat. The head of this secretariat will be the chief executive ofﬁcer of the NRA and as such will be the
principal administrator for the present programme. '
The operations will be carried out through work-programmes concluded between the NAG and the NRA.

Within this framework the NAG will delegate his power for the award, conclusion and execution of the
contracts to the NRA. - ’ v

Works contracts will be packaged into lots so as to be manageablevby local contractors. Works contracts
over ECU 1.0 m and under ECU 5.0 m will be awarded following accelerated tender procedures as provided
for in Article 301 of the Lomé IV Convention. Contracts under ECU 71.0 m will either be awarded by
restricted tender or for those under 'ECU 250,000 by direct agreement after consultation with 3 local '
contractors. Equipment and supplies will be purchased through open tender for amounts between ECU
100,000 and ECU 300,000, .and by direct agreement following consultation With 3 local suppliers, for
amounts less than ECU 100,000. The general conditions for all works contracts will, where applicable, be
those applying under Malawian law in accordance with Article 306 (b) of the Lomé IV Convention. ' .
At least 2 months in advance Of the start of the Programme budget year, the NRA will submit an Annual

Work Programme and Budget (AWPB) detailing the operations to be ﬁnanced and the expected
commitments and expenditures for each operation for approval of the NAG and the CommissiOn. In order to _
facilitate the management of payments under this Programme, a special sub-account will be established with

. the Road Fund from which payments for all works contracts will be made by the NRA on behalf of GoM. 1‘-

EDF and other contributions to the Programme sub- account will be accounted for separately. Authorisation ,
for the release of funds to the Programme special sub-accountwill be made on the basis of the approved
AWPB, with a 50% advance being paid after AWPB approval and the remaining 50% subject to detailed
reports justifying the use of the ﬁrst 75% of the advanced funds, subject to the agreement of the NAG and

, the EC Delegation. . ,
\ Independent auditors will carry out bi-annual audits of the sub-accoimt with the Road Fund including the

programme irhprest accounts. Closure of each AWPB will be on the basis of the annual audit.

3.3. ‘ Timetable . \ '
It is anticipated that this programme will be completed within three years. It is estimated that it will be two

1 years after the start of the programme before the proposed CRA regional ofﬁces are fully staffed and"

operational. Two years after the start of the irnplementation-phase is also the target ,date for transfer of
vehicle weight control functions to the NRA.The private sector training component is envisaged as a three- '
year programme, but unleSS substantial progress is made on pursuing this during the interim phase, the third
year of training may not be completed within three years of the start of implementation. The backlOg
maintenancevcomponent is also likely to ocCupy the fulllthree years proposed for the programme. The -
commencement of implementation shall be no later than 31 January 1999. ‘ The launching of the tender for

the construction of the weigh-stations shall be deemed to constitute thevcommencement of implementation.
The implementation of this programme shall be completed by 31 March 2001 at the latest. f

a 3.5. Special Conditions and Measure to be taken by the Government

The precondition for the start of the implementation phase of the institutional reform process is the
fulﬁlment of the institutional targets for the interim phase as set out in the Master Plan (cf Annex 2). This is

' item 4 below. The measures to be taken by the Government are:

l. NRA Board appointed and key staff recruited for both NRA and CRA,

_ 2. Agreement reached for the Road Fund to receive fuel levies direct from the Petroleum Control

Commission through separate lines in the price structure of both diesel and petrol that will proﬁde:
in 1998/99 the estimated minimum requirement for maintaining the core road network (MK 245
million in 1997 prices '- to be adjusted for price changes to 1998); ‘ ’
increases over the period of the programme to meet the target of ﬁnancing maintenance on the full
network in 2000/01 (estimate K313 million in 1997 prices - to be adjusted forprice changes to
2000);

3. . The backlog of monies collected under the 2 tambala/litre fuel levy for the road maintenance fund in
effect since mid-1996 to be paid into the Road Fund; ' i

-4. . Clause 15(2) of the NRA Act (1997) to be amended as outlined  the letter from Minister of Works

and Supplies dated 23 May, 1997 (cf Annex 3); v _
5. - _ Allactivities and follow-up action speciﬁed in the agreed Master Plan for the interim phase ending
March  998 to have been completed. - . . . ‘ 4 ’ - - ~

4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION ‘ _

4.1. Monitoring Indicators : i I ’ > -
Reports issued by NRA and the CRA will be the source for key indicators of the project’s progress. If the
project has been successful these reports will show increasing, assured and ultimatelyadequate ﬂows of
funds for road maintenance and the preservation of infrastructure. Physical indicators will demonstrate

- increasing productivity in maintenance performance. They will. also reveal the improved health of the road-

works subsector. Independent reports from the‘National Construction Industry Council will be available to
conﬁrm this. Speciﬁc indicators which will be shown in annual and Quarterly reports from these
organisations include approved annual road maintenance programmes and amounts achieved; total ﬁmds

. received and‘disbursed (and for what); average delay between completion of works, certiﬁcation and

payment; amount of works performed by type; number and value of contractslet, by type of works and class :
of contractor; average cost of works by type of operation. ' ' v ' , ' A ' "

_ Internal progreSs in institution-building and human resource develOpnrent at the NRA and CRA .Will testify
' 1 to the success of the technical assistance and staff training programmes. Numbers of courses completed

will indicate progress in respect of staff training. ' . .
For the private sector training component, the number of trainees enrolled and successfully completing the
courses will be the immediate indicator. Improvements in performance indicators for the execution of road
maintenance works will demonstrate that the acquired skills are being applied. I ' _ A v ;

From NRA and CRA reports it will also be possible to discern progress on the clearance of the maintenance

backlog. The speciﬁc works contracts will be monitored through the reportsof supervising consultants.

Speciﬁc project components relating to road safety and axle load weight co'ntrolwill have their own
indicators. As the project proceeds the indicators retainedwill show whether the measures that have been .
taken have secured the desired results of reducing accidents and overload offences.

Achievement of the overall objective of improved road nethork condition will become self-evident-to all
road users. The successful implementation 'of the institutional reform strategy will resuscitate objective
pavement monitoring programmes. Returns will become available which indicate how much of the road
network meets speciﬁc condition criteria. '

 - - I

I 4.2. Reviews and Evaluation

During the ﬁrst phase of the RMI programme, working .and steering committees have been established to _ ,

monitor progress.

An independent evaluation of the project will be scheduled forthe end of ' the ﬁrst year of the projecit.’ This
will recommend the timing for the subsequent evaluation - to be not later than the end of third year of the
project. The EU and the World Bankﬂvsﬁill participate. “ i '

FUNDING-MECHANISMS

The Road Fund should pay for maintenance activities on the core network
only, at an initially estimated cost of K245 million per year (1998-99) (1997 *
prices); ’ ‘ ’

As an interim goal, the Road Fund should pay for maintenance of the full

' _ network at an estimated cost of K3 13 million (2000-2001) (19977 priceS);

Inlthe longer term, the Road Fundshould pay for maintenance plus normal
rehabilitation at an estimated cost of K532. million; (2002 - 2003) (1997
prices); I ~

The Road Fund should, in the ﬁrst instance, be financed by a redistribution of .

t the fuel price make up to include a specific road fund levy. As an indication, a A v

levy of K099 per litre of blend and K1.1'3 per litre of diesel would raise the

. required "K245 million based on 1996 consumption levels, while distributing, .

'1 the burden equitably between different classes'of road user given the'damage"
caused to roads and benefits obtained from better maintainediroads; » ‘

7 The Road "Fund Should receive also-the revenues from vehicle and driver
