Brief description:

The objective of the project is to demonstrate approaches to increasing
incomes and living standards of the small rural householders in selected areas
of Malawi through more profitable agricultural production systems, increased
market access and value—added activities. This will be ensured through support
to targeted communities as follows:

- expanding markets and strengthening market access opportunities for rural

communities;

- intensifying production and improving quality of dominant crops, cassava;
- expanding engagement in post—harvest value—added activities.

The project has the following specific objectives
1. To extend improved production and on—farm value addition of cassava
and other traditional staples.
2. To strengthen the capacity of farmers, farmers groups and cooperatives
to plan, implement, and manage value addition and improve market

access for produce.

3. To identify, appraise and promote entry for cassava and alternative
high value farm products in rural and urban markets.

 

 

Enhancing Food Security in Cassava-based Farming Systems
in Malawi

A. BACKGROUND

Malawi continues to face unacceptable levels of vulnerability. During the 2005-2006
growing season, the country experienced the worst food crisis since 1994. The production
of maize, Malawi’s most important staple crop decreased by 29% compared to the
already poor harvest that year. During the 2004—2005 agricultural season, the country was
able to produce just 55% of the 2.2 million MT of maize needed for national
consumption. At least 4.2 million people, 34% of the county’s total population, are at risk
of experiencing serious food shortages, beginning in June 2005 through March 2006
totaling close to 270, 000 MT. Efforts are being put in place by government, in
collaboration with donors, UN agencies and other NGOs to provide humanitarian
assistance through safety nets and direct food relief distribution to the affected
households.

In the last two growing seasons of 2005/2006—2006/2007, the Government through the
fertiliser subsidy programme managed to target the resource poor farmers by reducing the
price of fertiliser at an affordable price of $7 but not all farmers could afford to acquire
fertiliser even at the subsidized price because farmers have no source of income as most
of the crops grown are for subsistence and are of low value. Among several factors,the
underlying cause of food insecurity in Malawi is the chronic poverty, which contributes
to low agricultural productivity. Lack of definite commodity markets and inability of
farmers to add value to farm produce has kept rural poverty unabated.

FAO with financial assistance from the Italian Trust Fund for Food Security, has signed
an agreement with Malawi Government to support implementation of a project aimed
enhancing food security by contributing to improvement in food security and small—scale
farmer livelihoods, through cassava commercialisation . The project is budgeted for
seven hundred fifty thousand United States Dollars ($750,000), for two years. However,
the estimated budget for implementing the planned activities of the project in country is
$547,210 (excluding cost for technical support services, but including travel allowance
for national project personnel for regional workshops).

B. PROJECT RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION

B.1 Problems to be addressed and present situation

Some policy reforms have reduced macroeconomic imbalances, encouraged the private
sector and reduced the ‘crowding—out’ behaviour of parastatals. However, significant

obstacles still remain to improve farm productivity and income. The economic growth
achieved appears to have had little impact on farmers in making most of domestic market
opportunities. In spite of over a decade of economic reforms to correct policy distortions,
Malawi was until the year 2005/2006 still a net importers of food, and poverty continues
to be prevalent in rural areas.

It is widely recognized that the economic gains have not been felt amongst the large
numbers of smallholder farmers residing in predominantly cassava growing areas and the
potential for growth in the domestic markets has not been fully explored nor exploited.
Problems associated with emerging cassava—based cropping systems in Malawi include
the small—scale and fragmented nature of land holdings, unorganized farmers and
markets, lack of market information, difficulties accessing markets, and inconsistency of
supply. Nonetheless, domestic market prospects are attractive as urban and agro—
industrial demand for root crops is growing, and opportunities to strengthen crop—
livestock interactions are better researched and understood. Notwithstanding the existence
of the potential for cassava production, and in particular value adding activities, there is a
need to explore the possibility of encouraging farm enterprise diversification into higher
value crops and livestock products. More emphasis is also needed to develop markets for
smallholder farmers’ resident in the cassava growing areas in Malawi.

Specific attention is needed in the following areas:

a. Low productivity in cassava-based farming systems through the use of inappropriate
varieties and inadequate farmer knowledge and skills.

The main challenge is to raise productivity through better crop management. While
supplies of new germplasm has improved, average farm yields are only 20 percent of the
potential for new varieties. A major reason for the continuing low productivity of
cassava—based cropping systems is that farmers rarely apply improved water conservation
and fertility management practices and the adoption of improved technologies has been
low. Little attention has been paid to introducing innovative solutions for soil, water and
nutrient management; the main factors limiting yields. Fertilizer recommendations tend to
be based on limited regional information and largely ignore the climatic and socio—
economic constraints faced by farmers.

A series of improved technologies are needed that take into account the specific resource
constraints of different categories of farmers. For example, soil fertility solutions need to
be cast around how much fertilizer a farmer should apply to optimize income gains and
maximize returns on investment. The use of appropriate crop varieties and more resilient
production systems (e.g. through better soil, water and nutrient management) can
significantly reduce production risks and household vulnerability in drought years.

b. The need to diversify the farming system and promote higher value farm enterprises

Smallholder farmers no longer face the fixed, pan—territorial prices that provided them
with guaranteed market outlets. They similarly no longer face a predictable supply of
inputs. The market environment in the past, although far from perfect, did offer farmers
some degree of economic security. The administrative system of the past has largely been
replaced by a system in which prices, whether for selling produce or purchasing inputs,

are now largely negotiated. New commercial relations need to be struck with a large
number of suppliers and buyers. Furthermore, physical access to most markets is poor,
transaction costs are high, and these factors, combined with farmers’ lack of organisation,
result in low and erratic producer prices.

A transformation is needed if the farming system is to become more competitive and
commercially oriented and to better exploit the range of market opportunities. A potential
exists to support smallholder farmers by integrating mixed cropping and ruminants and
where market demand exists to introduce enterprises that increase farm income and
improve household food security. Moreover, there is also potential for diversification
within the cassava based system towards higher value products with assured markets.
Opportunities to diversify exist through promoting better varieties of cassava for: (1)
animal feeds (silage) which require ‘bitter’ varieties with large biomass production, (2)
bakery products that target varieties with high ﬂour or dry matter content, and (3) starch
industry (including industrial glues) that require large tuber varieties with high
carbohydrate content. The strategy to be followed also needs a study of alternative high
value enterprises, but this requires that farmers have the skills and competencies to
respond to market changes and adjust their farming system accordingly.

Livestock is by culture an integral part of the farming systems in Malawi, where it is both
a substantial income generator and food security asset for smallholder farmers.
Significant advances have occurred in the production, management, and conservation of
high quality adapted forages and in silage-making techniques for the smallholder dairy
and livestock farmers. Yet there is extensive underutilization of system by—products
(silage, stover, forages) and crop residues for supplementary feeding of animals, and
substitute for imported animal feeds on the farm. There is need for a stronger focus on
better management and utilization of dry season feeding to boost system productivity and
production in terms of milk yields and draught power. The production of byproducts from
cassava production can reduce the need for expensive supplementation for both dairy and
cattle. These opportunities should be explored in the course of diversifying cassava
products.

c. Weak marketing systems

Liberalization of agricultural markets in Malawi has led to the emergence of an
expanding body of market intermediaries who purchase from and supply inputs to the
smallholder sector. The intermediaries range in size from the small rural trader with a
village shop, to small/medium trader/contract buyers who operate quasi—out grower
schemes, and on to country wide operations of large scale companies. The former group
has been expanding as liberalization has increased opportunities, but they represent a
relatively inefficient segment without many of the prerequisite skills and without
adequate understanding of the dynamics of the market and the need to create confidence
in their relationships with smallholder farmers.

For the majority of farmers producing staple cereal crops the low margin of profitability
and the weak communications and infrastructure networks have created major problems.
Market access has become a critical determinant of farmers’ production systems; those
who live close to better roads and have more frequent and direct contact with the market

are willing to produce more systematically for the market, while those with poor market
access have little incentive to produce crops other than those required for domestic
consumption. Put another way, improved market access is a prerequisite to increased
farmer income. Although there are no quantitative market assessments, traders estimate
that domestic market potential for cassava is grossly unfulfilled, while the export market
is non—existent.

In May 2001, a conference in Malawi identified several constraints working against
agricultural commercialization including (a) small scale and fragmented production units,
(b) seasonality of supply, (c) unorganized markets and farmers, (d) lack of market
information, (e) lack of access to markets, (f) irregular supply to industries, (g) subjective
pricing structure, mainly supply driven, (h) poor quality of farm made products (i) weak
farming skills to promote market oriented production. Successful marketing requires
farmers to be organized within marketing groups to have knowledge of demand,
sufficient storage and transport facilities, and capital in order to be fully skilled to service
and lobby on behalf of membership. This capacity has not been developed.

d. Capacity building

Gaps exist in the capacity of farmers and farmer groups to promote productivity growth,
and enterprise diversification linked to expansion of commercial markets. Farmer
organizations are weak because of inexperienced governance and leadership, which limits
their capacity to solve farming issues and to articulate and lobby group needs and
demands. Inadequate entrepreneurial skills and attitudes threaten the capacity of farmers
and the private sector to participate in market transactions, which are needed to drive
productivity and income growth.

There is a need to develop participatory training methodologies aimed at enhancing the
skills of farmers in farm business management and market oriented farming. Farmers
should be empowered so that they can decide on the technical and farm business
messages that they need to ensure greater efficiency, productivity and profitability of
their limited resource base. Innovative farmer training methodologies such as Farmer
Business Schools, based on experiential learning should be encouraged and introduced to
promote a market oriented approach to extension.

B.2 Target beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries of the project are small scale farmers with up to 2.5 hectares of
land. Special consideration will be placed on marginal farmers, the landless and women-
headed households in both the rural areas and peri—urban settings. It is intended that over
duration of the project phase some 5,000 beneficiary households will be reached, the
targeted areas. The project will endeavour to ensure a gender balance by organising
women into gender specific groups or partnerships as and when appropriate, promoting
their inclusion and role in mixed gender organisations and ensuring that the extension
message provided to farmers is gender sensitive.

The indirect recipients will comprise field level extension workers, technical support
staff, meso—level service providers and government policy level decision makers. The
development of effective and sustainable support service delivery will rest on creating a
functional partnership between the farming community, the project, the public sector
advisory services, N GOs and private sector service providers for the mutual benefit of all.
Another set of important clients are the agribusiness companies providing support
services with the mandate and opportunity to promote more productive and profitable
farming through input and output markets, and through improved market analysis and
understanding.

C. PROJECT STRATEGY, AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS

C.1 Expected end-of-project situation and elements required for sustainability

This project will focus on enhancing farm income through enterprise diversification,
training and extension in rural enterprise development and marketing. Farmers will be
organised into extension groups for training purposes aimed at enhancing their farm
business management skills and competencies. As the project duration is short it is
appropriate to regard it as a pilot phase where methodologies will be developed and tested
that will have a wider application over time in other rural areas.

At the end of the project it can be expected that there will be:

i. Strong capacity for farmers, farmers groups, cooperatives and support service
providers to plan, implement, and manage value addition and improve market access
for produce and products

ii. Strong linkages between, cassava producer groups, agri—business service providers
and cassava processors

iii. Increased productivity, value addition and income of cassava by producers and
processors.

iv. Increased awareness of need for increasecd investment and policy support in the
cassava sub—sector for national food security and economic growth.

The combined effect of all of the above is expected to result in a commitment within the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security to implement these approaches on a broader
scale in other parts of the country. Furthermore, the project should result in greater
utilization of cassava products that have a comparative advantage, but are underutilized
because of inherent problems with scale and fragmented production. Successful
commercialization will provide stimulus for the private sector to invest into local cassava
processing for industrial applications. This project aims to prove that an alternative exists
— a strategy of enterprise diversification and market integration more attuned to the
specific needs of the market and to the resource levels of farm households.

Replication is expected to take place once the perceived benefits of the project are felt.
Success of the project will encourage farmers in neighbouring villages to demand support
from advisory service providers including the public extension service, NGOs, private

sector bodies to promote farm enterprise diversification and market oriented production.
Furthermore, as the project develops there might be potential for the targeted farmers to
link up to financial service providers as a way of expanding operations.

The ultimate vision of the project is to upgrade the skills and capacities of farmers
through the introduction of farm management business schools. Through good practices
of advisory service delivery awareness amongst other service providers will be created of
the need to be more responsive to client demands, involving farmers in decision making
and developing a broad base of stakeholder services. The project will similarly enhance
the capacity and skills of front line extension workers to provide farm management
advice based on knowledge of market opportunities.

As the project focuses on capacity building and encourages self reliance amongst farmers
it is intended that a change will take place in the mentality that currently exists within
rural communities assisted by donor projects, encouraging group management, ownership
and local responsibility.

C.2 Project Strategy
Geographical location

The approach adopted is to select sites representative of the cassava based farming
systems in Malawi, in selected areas along Lilongwe, north Salima and Nkhotakota
corridor, which are well known as a cassava and maize producing area. The selection of
sites should provide a wide range of socio—economic conditions of the target group, and
selection of specific extension to target the project will be subject to agreement with
District Executive Committees of in the three districts of Lilongwe, Salima and
Nkhotakota. However, the selection will be guided by (a) potential for cassava
production, (b) accessability to a potential market, (c) and willingness of grassroot
beneficiaries to participate and (d) willing partners to develop cassava processing. Each
of these locations will serve as pilot demonstration areas or “impact points” for testing the
farm business management extension models. The approach should ensure that examples
of ‘good practices’ can be developed in farm management extension service delivery to
promote market oriented production and diversification.

The strategy expressly seeks to increase farm productivity and income and thereby
improve food security in cassava—based farming systems areas. Improving food security
and farm income requires an approach that identifies good practices stimulates better
market integration through the organization of farmers, buyers and processors in ways
which can effectively increase crop productivity and overall farm income.

The project duration is two years. During this period the project will be technically
supported by an international expert (TCDC). Towards the end of the phase management
responsibility for the project would be gradually transferred over to national counterparts
for sustained replication. A further period beyond the life of the project should be built in
to the project where the processes and practices can be further developed and a greater
impact amongst farmers attained. The extension approach will be further replicated over
this phase.

During the project life, given the resources and the time—frame, the project will be able to
contribute to the process of policy change, as it will adopt a vigorous approach of
awareness raising and capacity building amongst policy makers and stakeholders. The
experiences from the field will also need to be shared with all stakeholders. The project
will have a pivotal role in facilitating information exchange through the development of
networks. A substantial awareness creation campaign will be conducted amongst the
NGO community and others throughout the period of implementation. The outcome will
be a substantially increased understanding of the project purpose by all stakeholders
resulting in improved support for and involvement in its implementation.

Although project duration is only two years, it is necessary that from the outset
Government should be encouraged to replicate and scale up of some of the ‘good
practices’ that emerge from the project. This could be done through expanding beyond
the project area and training a greater number of front line extension workers. The project
will endevour to make an impact in the following areas:

Enhancing agricultural productivity: The project will focus on introducing high yielding
cassava varieties and promoting the application of best parctices to improve the
productivity of the cassava—based cropping systems. The intention will be to look for
multiple solutions attuned to the needs and budgets of diverse sets of farm households.
The project should also result in greater utilization of cassava products that possess a
comparative advantage, but are currently underutilized because of inherent problems of
scale and fragmented production.

Livelihoods diversiﬁcation: The project will identify diversified income sources from
cassava products through participatory processes. This will require an understanding of
the livelihood systems of the rural community, identifying potential enterprises for
introduction into the farming system, realigning the support service delivery system to
enhance its capacity to deliver quality services that respond to farmer needs, provide
farmers with training in farm management and rural enterprise development and establish
linkages with the private sector. Successful commercialization should provide the
stimulus for the private sector to invest into local cassava processing. Through these
efforts, farm incomes and food security in the assisted districts could be increased.

Marketing: Emphasis will be placed on linking enterprise development and uptake with
improvement in agricultural input and output markets. Incentives to introduce new farm
enterprises depend on both input costs and product prices. Only when farmers have
access to efficient and attractive output markets will they make the necessary investments
to increase production beyond household food needs. Costs and prices are likely to be
more favorable in areas where market infrastructure is dense. Enterprise promotion will
be linked to agro-input dealer programmes in Malawi to encourage the sale of improved
inputs within each project area. Market access will also be improved by providing
farmers with market information, to enable them to broaden their options when selecting
products, inputs and market outlets. Improvements will also be made by linking farmers
to markets through contractual arrangements within out—grower or nucleus estate schemes
or directly to markets. The strategy is to work with farmers and private sector partners to

10

systematically identify commercial opportunities that can inﬂuence farm planning and the
production strategies of differently resourced rural households.

Capacity building: The project will have a strong capacity building component geared to
create and strengthen farmer groups, farmer associations/networks and technical staff
capable of implementing the programme. Training will be developed in a range of topics
on farm business management to enhance the capacity and skills of farmers and extension
staff for better management decision making. It is proposed that the concept of the
Farmer Field School will be adapted to provide training to farmers in farm business
management. Subjects to be covered would include farm planning, planning for the
market, enterprise profitability, cash ﬂow analysis amongst others. However specific
elements would be selected by participating communities according to their priorities,
constraints and opportunities. Emphasis in training activities will be to equip farmers with
the necessary skills and knowledge to make informed decisions about commercial
farming opportunities.

Communication and information: Mass media communication is recognized by the
Ministries of Agriculture as an economically viable and effective means of delivering
agricultural information to the farming communities. However to be truly effective,
communication media and messages must be up—to—date, relevant and responsive to the
real information and communication needs of their audiences. This requires an in—depth
knowledge of the socio—economic needs of the people, their knowledge, attitudes, and
practices in respect of the proposed innovations. It further requires an understanding of
the information channels that they use and find credible, as well as informal groups of
people who may inﬂuence them. Rural broadcasters, consequently, need to be trained in
how to collect information from various sources, including the farmers themselves, and
make it available in appropriate formats and languages that rural audiences can readily
understand. The project will work with N GOs to enhance information ﬂows at rural level,
and to explore how best to use information technology for linking market intelligence and
farm decision making in the framework of farmer field school, experiential learning.

Implementation: Implementation of the project will be through locally contracted
organizations which are already in the target working with farmers, and who have
comparative advantage to implement the planned activites. In Malawi IITA through its
regional network, SARRNET and Total Land Care, an N GO dedicated to promoting
natural resource management have been identified as most suitable organizations. The
two organizations will be supported with financial allocations, as provided for the project
document (see attached budget) and a letter of Agreement will be signed with each
organization.

The contractors will subcontract to implement specialised services such as provision of
Farmer Field Schools and Farm Business Schools (e.g. training, technical support for
action—research). Separate contracts will also be drawn to for community support, to
finance community level development as provided for in the project document. However,
the funds will be managed by the contractor, in order to reduce direct monitoring and
reporting requirements of the Project.

11

The contracted organizations will be provided financial support to suppliment salary for
up to five extension workers who will have the primary responsibility facilitating
information exchange amongst farmers and lead the process of formation and
development of farmer extension groups. These will also function as intermediarys
between farmers and Government counterpart technical subject matter specialists both in
the District and at Headquarters Level.

One of the objectives of the project is to facilitate farmers in their capacity to demonstrate
and promote technologies broadly throughout the area. The local extension workers play
an important role. It is expected that as part of the implementation strategy lead farmers
will be selected from within the local community as contact persons who will work with
the local extension workers. In some contexts, particularly where the extension message
should refer to farm-household management, women from within the communities should
also be identified as local voluntary activists. Capacity building of farmers and their
groups will require the close involvement of the extension workers both as catalysts and
active partners able to identify key community members who through exposure, training
and experience could continue the extension efforts over the medium to long term. The
extension workers will be trained in technical multi—sectoral subject areas as well as
group formation, marketing and farm business management and are critical to achieving
the project objectives. It is also recommended that the project looks at the possibility of
recruiting women extension workers where and when appropriate.

C.3 Institutional framework and counterpart support capacity

The Project Manager in collaboration with the National Project will link up with the main
stakeholders involved in agro— processing and marketing activities and engage them on a
regular basis in periodic project review meetings. A national inception workshop (1-2
days) has been planned, with the following intention:

o to bring together the main stakeholders to brief them on the project purpose,
objectives and proposed activities;

0 to seek buy—in and establish partnerships and operational linkages in specific
project locations;

0 to assist project management in developing a consensus for work plans and
operational modalities;

o to assign implementation responsibilities to specific departments and individuals
within the districts and project sites;

0 to agree on the ground rules for monitoring and evaluating the project; and

0 ensure coherence and integration of project activities into the national development
framework.

A National Task Force will be responsible for implementation oversight of the project
and will comprise the NPC, FAOR, District Commissioner and District Agricultural
Development Officers from the project areas. Meetings will be held periodically, led by
the National Project Coordinator who will also be responsible for reporting to counterpart
institutions. At least twice during project implementation period, selected members of the
Task Force and the project implementation teams will meet to report on progress,

12

exchange field experiences and plan an exit strategy for the project. Technical quality
control and coordination of project activities will be ensured by this project structure,
which will be reinforced by close monitoring and regular technical support by the FAO
Representative and FAQ technical officers in specific areas of expertise.

C.4 Partnerships

The project aims at ensuring that tangible and quantifiable development impacts are
achieved by bringing farmers together with other stakeholders (including the private
sector) during the project inception period, while providing support for strategic
partnerships in the production and marketing chain. It aims at utilizing the critical mass of
human resources and institutions working together through actions aimed at stimulating
the ﬂow of knowledge, technology and good practices amongst stakeholders engaged in
the cassava sub—sector.

The project will disseminate knowledge exchange of ‘good practices’ in production,
harvesting, and marketing. The project will build on and add value to existing work and
experience conducted in the region and thereby ensure the potential for success. In
particular collaboration will be forged to enhance production and productivity and
promote interventions aimed at adding value in form of contracts with IITA, through its
regional Root Crops Research Network for Southern Africa (SARRNET), and Total Land
Care, an NGO promoting best practices in natural resource management, capacity
building and community mobilization.

These partnership arrangements provide an excellent opportunity to directly address the
pressing issues of poverty and food security in the countries as well as a stronger ﬂow of
communication and synergy as project implementation proceeds. Through collaborative
action it is expected that the perception of cassava as a ‘poor man’s crop’ in Malawi will
change to one that provides opportunities for employment and income generation and in
this way meet the rural and urban food security needs of the poor.

Implementation arrangements will be discussed during the inception phase of the project
bearing in mind that availability and capacity of potential partners as identified during the
formulation phase. Consequently, the inception workshops will involve local stakeholders
and service providers in Malawi (input dealers, traders, milling factories, farmer
associations and and NGos.

C.5 WORKPLAN

i. Objectives of the Assistance
To improve food security and small farmer livelihoods through the commercialisation of

D. INPUTS
D.1 Government Input (s)

As part of its contribution to the project, the Government shall make available a National
Project Coordinator to work as counterpart to the FAO team. In addition, Government
will be responsible for providing technical counterparts in specific areas of expertise
required as well as the buildings, training facilities, equipment, transport and other local
services necessary to support the Government contribution. As staff numbers are not yet
known, no specific estimate of the Govemment’s budget for provision of staff has been
included. The MOAIs will be expected to make suitable office space available in the
vicinity of the project offices in Nkhota—kota and Lilongwe.

D.2 Donor Inputs through FAO

i. Consultants/Country Level Personnel

The Project Manager has a key role to develop the implementation strategy and
coordinate the project contract teams. In addition S/he will be responsible for the overall
quality of implementation, the design and organization of a monitoring and evaluation
system, taking responsibility for the production of IEC materials, and the formulation and
implementation of training programmes. S/he will also be responsible for work plan
preparation and supervising the activities of the extension teams and will provide
technical guidance to the contractors for project implementation, identification of
consultants for implementing specialised activities, such as training in business skills and
strengthening farmer/market (private sector) linkagesas well as preparing a programme
of FAO STS technical backstopping support.

ii. Training

Provision has been made for adapting existing training materials for use in formal
training activities for cassava production, value addition, marketing, farm business
management, extension methods, cooperative formation/development, gender awareness
and the organisation of shorter duration workshops on specific topics. The farmer group
training will aim at creating capacity of individuals and as groups in farm business
management, cooperative management, mobilising financing, procuring inputs,

18

 

marketing produce and preparing business plans amongst others. Other activities will
include holding meetings for exchange of lessons from the farmer business schools and
conducting farmer to farmer training following the Success Case Replication
Methodology to be promoted by the project. The majority of the training activities will be
less formal and will call for the organisation of farmers into extension groups.

As part of the institutionalization and up—scaling plan of the Project, there will be site—to—
site visits for lesson sharing and support to training workshops in other parts of the
country, study tours within the project areas. As a matter of principle no detailed list of
trainings has been drawn up realizing the demand focus of the approach.

The contractors will present their annual workplans and a budget to the Project Manager
for funds to be disbursed.

iii. Non-expendable equipment

The principal items of non-expendable equipment will be vehicles. The project will be
will be allotted 1 four wheel drive wehicle on a shared basis with the Project Manager’s
office, with the two identified contractors, in addition to ten (10) motor bikes which will
be also be made availble on fulltime basis, as the principal activity will be to interact with
farmers on a regular and consistent basis. The project will also support

E. PROJECT REPORTING, REVIEW AND EVALUATION
E.1 Project Reporting

The Project Manager will prepare an Inception Report within the first six weeks of the
project containing a detailed project work plan, the practical modalities for beneficiary
selection and the support expected from project staff. The report will be submitted to
TCAP/SMU for review and technical clearance by relevant Technical Services.

The Project Manager will prepare every six months, a Project Progress Report in English,
using the standard FAO format for Trust Fund Project. The report will contain:

0 an account of actual implementation of the activities compared to that scheduled in
the Work—plan, and the achievement of outputs, based on the objectively—verifiable
indicators;

0 an identification of any problems and constraints (technical, human, financial, etc.)
encountered during implementation;

0 recommendations for corrective measures;

0 a detailed Work—plan for the following reporting period.

As a basis for project monitoring each of these Project Progress Reports is to be
submitted to AGSF for information and comment, before on forwarding to the Donor
Government through TCAP/SMU, and to the Recipient Government through the FAO
Offices.

19

At the end of their missions all international technical consultants involved in the project
will prepare a report on their activities within the framework of the Unit, for forwarding
to AGSF and TCAP/SMU. The reports will provide details on the results of their mission
as well as conclusions and recommendations for future actions.

In the concluding months of the Project the Project Manager will prepare a draft Terminal
Report in accordance with FAO reporting guidelines. It will assess in a concise manner,
the extent to which the Project's scheduled activities have been carried out, its outputs
produced, the progress towards achievement of the immediate objectives and related
development objective, and will also present recommendations for any future follow—up
action arising out of the Project. The draft will be submitted to AGSF for review and
technical clearance by relevant Technical Services, before transmission to the donor.
Upon conclusion of the project it will be finalized and submitted to the Recipient and
Donor Governments.” All reports are to be submitted in English.

Tripartite Mid-term Review. Annual technical reviews may be undertaken if deemed
necessary. Terminal Tripartite Review meeting is also scheduled in order to examine
project achievements and decide on eventual follow—up. The organization, terms of
reference and exact timing and place of these Reviews will be decided in consultation
between FAO and the Malawi Govemment/agencies and the Donor. Two regional
review meetings are schedulled in mid term and towards the end of the project to
examine progress and decide on the future of the project.
