1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

1.1 Situation and Context Analysis
A recent report entitled: National Response to Gender-Based Violence- Malawi Programme
commissioned by UNFPA acknowledges that, while there is still need for more legislative and
policy work, generally, the legal and policy framework in Malawi is conducive for promotion and
protection of individual human rights. However, numerous studies on gender-based violence and
HIV and AIDS which the Report cites and analyzes repeatedly blame lack of implementation of
the various policies and legislation and ineffective law enforcement systems, among other key
factors, for a lot of injustices done to the victims of gender based violence (GBV) and HIV and
AIDS related discrimination. The Report analyses and outlines several other factors and statistics
which promote GBV and HIV and AIDS. These include the following:
0 Negative traditional and cultural values, attitudes and practices;
0 A culture of “silence” which leads to non-reporting of cases
0 Continued stigma and discrimination
o lnequity and inequality in decision-making and accessing resources between men and
women.
0 Reactive as opposed to proactive and systematic advocacy and lobbying by civil society;
0 Lack of effective community level networking and collaboration among NGOs, 0803 and
networks.

1.2 Financial Support Being Requested:

Malawi Human Rights Resource Centre (MHRRC), a local capacity building human rights NGO
with a focus on human rights networks, CSOs, NGOs and 0803, seeks the financial support of
UNFPA for a three year project on “Community Mobilization on the Twin Pandemics of
Gender Based Violence and HIV and AIDS- an Advocacy for Social Justice Programme.”
The amount of financial support needed is US$1million per year; a total of US$3million for the
three-year period of the proposed programme.

1.3 Purpose for which Funds will be used:

This programme has been designed with a view to further the implementation of a set of activities
outlined in the National Response to Gender-Based Violence- Malawi Programme
commissioned by UNFPA— especially those education, advocacy and capacity building activities
assigned to NGOs and the various Networks:

Thus, the main goal of this programme will be:
To empower women, men, girls and boys as well as opinion leaders in the target
communities with gender knowledge which will result into community action against
gender based violence and empowerment of Women and the Girl chi/d thereby reducing
the spread of HIV and AIDS.

This programme has three main related objectives as follows:

Objective One: Public awareness, public education and legal literacy

c To create gender awareness among men and women, boys and girls resulting into
reduced HIV and AIDS contracted due to Gender inequalities;

Objective Two: Advocacy for Social Justice:

0 To mobilize Girls and women into Action Groups Against gender based violence and HIV
and AIDS related abuse.

0 To mobilise communities into Watchdog Committees to monitor and report on cases of
gender based violence, sexual abuse and HIV and AIDS.

0 To advocate and lobby for positive changes in policy, laws and administrative decisions.

0 To contribute to the national and global action to end gender based violence.

Objective Three: Capacity Building in the GBV and HIV and AIDS fields.

0 I10 Euild the capatchity of community based redress mechanisms, law enforcement
ec amsms an 0 er service providers/ duty bearers to effectivel '

and cases of GBV and HIV and AIDS y respond to Issues

0 To strengthen the networking and collaborative capacities of CSOs, NGOs and C805.

0 To train opinion leaders in the targeted communities in gender issues and HIV/AIDS and
make them agents for advocating for change in traditional, cultural, religious values and
practices that impact negatively on women and the girl child;

0 To provide young girls and boys in the target communities with life skills training.

1.4 Geographical coverage and Selection of Project Sites

TheprOJect will be implemented in all the three regions of Malawi with a specific focus on 12
districts and 25 traditional authorities. These will be three districts of the Northern Region
(M2imba, Rumphi and Chitipa); five districts of the Central Region (Lilongwe, Dowa, Kasungu,
Dedza and Nkhotakota) and four districts of the Southern Regidn (Mulanje, Ma'ngoc'hi, Zomba
and Neno). Two traditional authorities will be targeted in each district, except Lilongwe where
three T/As will be targeted including the peri-urban Area 25.
1.5 Methodology:

This programme will employ highly “

participatory” methods to ensure that women and girls, men
and boys, especially the marginalize

d and vulnerable poor people are involved in issues affecting
their own lives. The main focus of the programme will be on “Mobilization for Action.” Special
attention will be paid to empowerment of women and children to stand up against acts of gender
based violence and HIV and AIDS related abuse. At the same time, capacity building will focus on
the various institutions and mechanisms such as leadership, Victim Support Units, Voluntary
Counselling and Testing Centres as well as justice delivery and redress mechanisms so that they
are better able to respond effectively to GBV and HIV and AIDS related cases and issues.

While this project will be implemented at a national level, it is important to mention the following
other considerations in its approach to implementing the project:

(a) Intensive Approach (District and TIA level interventions):

MHRRC will employ a double - pronged operational strategy: Intensive and Extensive
approaches. The intensive strategy will involve MHRRC working with a few selected
community based 080s and CBOs in supporting them implement gender based violence and
HIV and AIDS related interventions through resource provision, mentoring and coaching and
supporting organizational and institutional development. The projects will be area as well as
activity based. The role of the Centre will be to provide resources to these CSOs and 0803 and
provide specific capacity building and technical support in order to ensure impact. This approach
towards implementation of the programme will expound on the “Zoom Site" concept which

MHRRC has been piloting in Kanengo, Lilongwe (within the three T/As of Mtema, Chimutu and
Chitukula).

(b) The Extensive Approach (National and African-Regional Interventions)

MHRRC will work extensively with a wide number of CSOs, NGOs and other institutions through
knowledge management, training and facilitating networking and collaboration. The Centre will
design a comprehensive capacity building program for an agreed number of partner CSOs,
NGOs and institutions. Combining the intensive strategy above and the extensive strategy just
described will ensure that the Centre is providing effective capacity building services rooted in
evidence and practice rather than just theoretical and uncontextualized capacity building services.

(c) A Rights-based approach to gender based violence and HIV and AIDS:

The implementation of the project will adopt a Rights-based approach to gender based violence
and HIV and AIDS. In this regard, the project approach will recognise and be based on promotion
of the norms, standards and principles of the international human rights system contained in the
wealth of international treaties and declarations to which Malawi is a party. This approach will be

complemented by domestic provisions since most of the international standards have already
been incorporated into domestic law and policy.

 

 

2.0 THE PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION:

2.1 Situational Analysis and Description of the Problem

A recent report entitled: National Response to Gender-Based Violence- Malawi
Programme commissioned by UNFPA analyses and outlines several factors and
statistics which conspire and constrain any efforts towards addressing issues of GBV
and HIV and AIDS. These include the following:

0 Malawi is one of the poorest countries in Africa with an estimated per capita
income in 2000 of USD 170 per annum. Poverty levels in Malawi are high with
65.3% of the population of about 12 million defined as poor. Malawi has a high
illiteracy level of 38%. The adult literacy rate is at 62% with fewer women able to
read and write. Poverty levels are worse in rural areas with-the Southern region
recording the highest levels. Out of the total population, 52% is female and 48%
male.

0 Since the first record case of AIDS in Malawi in 1985, many Malawians have
been infected and affected by HIV and AIDS. By 2003 almost a million
Malawians were living with HIV and AIDS. HIV prevalence in Malawi has
remained high ranging between 14.67% in 1999 to 14.33% in 2004. The
incidence of HIV in Malawi has not changed over the years. Rates of new
infections have remained at around 4% per year. The Malawi National AIDS
Commission (NAC) estimates the prevalence to be about 14% of the adult
population in the 14-49 year age group, and that about 80,000 people die of
AIDS every year. Infection rates are high in 14—24 age groups with more girls
being infected than boys. Women are increasingly bearing the blunt of the
epidemic due to several factors including cultural and socio economic factors.
The epidemic has also increased the number of orphans that is being estimated
at about 740,000 across Malawi.

2.2 Gender Based Violence

Malawi recognizes that gender based violence is a severe impediment to poverty
reduction. The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy had incorporated a gender
strategy that focused on breaking the cultural and traditional factors which create and
perpetuate gender inequalities as a speciﬁc objective. Additionally, Malawi developed
and launched its “National Gender Policy” in 2000, which advocates for gender equality
and equity and the “National Strategy to Combat gender Based Violence" in 2002 as well
as the “National HIV Policy” in 2003. These key documents spell out the Policy direction
with regards to the national efforts to combat GBV and HIV and AIDS. Malawi has also
recently passed a bill on Prevention of Domestic Violence that was assented by the
President on 16th May 2006. The Government of Malawi has also ratified a number of
international and regional conventions that deal with the elimination of discrimination and
“may.” Im afﬁrm it: nnmmifmanl These. include the Convention on the Elimination of all

 

the spread of HIV/AIDS pandemic. Work is currently in progress on drafting of a
legislation to address HIV and AIDS related issues by the Malawi Law Commission.

Despite these efforts, GBV still remains a problem in Malawi. Research studies
undertaken between 1998-2005 all seem to point to the same issues. The initial GTZ
and the Network Against Gender Based Violence (NAGBV) studies (1999) showed that
96% of the perpetrators of violence against women were men and 99% of the victims
were women. Another baseline study by the Combating Gender based Violence project
Entitled “Listening to Peoples' Voices" (2003) found that 90% of the people interviewed
in six districts in Malawi revealed that men are the main perpetrators of GBV. The study
went further to highlight that men as authoritarian patriarchs believe they have the right
to discipline their wives through beatings should their wives not fulﬁll their expected roles
_ which include the provisionvof, sex .on demand as well as domestic chores such as the
preparation of meals. Another study on “Gender Based Violence in the Workplace”
(2005) by the NGO Gender Coordination Network (NGOGCN) revealed that of those that
experienced GBV, 100% of the female respondents said males were the perpetrators,
and 66.7% of the male respondents said women were the perpetrators. While yet
another recent study funded by DFlD and carried out by the National Statistics Ofﬁce on
the “Intimate Partner Violence” (December 2005) states that out of the 3,546 women and
2,246 men sampled across Malawi, 30% of women reported experiencing physical
abuse and 35% experienced some form of sexual abuse. 30% had experienced being
hit or punched by their partner and 11% reported being forced to have sex against their
will.

The survey also established that 90% of men interviewed viewed physical abuse as
unacceptable, though 20% thought it was acceptable to touch their partners’ body
without their consent while 4.5% of the men believed it was acceptable to have
penetrative sex without their partners consent.

In summary, these studies reveal that:

0 while there is still more legislative and policy work to be done, generally, the legal
and policy framework is conducive for promotion and protection of individual
human rights. However, such studies on gender-based violence and HIV and
AIDS have blamed law enforcement system, among other key factors, for a lot of
injustices done to the victims of violence. It has been noted that such victims
receive little or no support from the traditional authorities, the police, courts,
magistrates and judges. Even where they are courageous enough to seek
redress, they meet serious obstacles at every point and generally, perpetrators of
violence are allowed to get away with the crimes -or with very lenient sentences.

0 The dualism of traditional and statutory law has also allowed the violation and
abuse of women's rights. Customary law generally conforms to patriarchal
interests, and violence against women and girls is often justified as a cultural
norm. The law enforcement agents, most of whom are male, are heavily
influenced by patriarchal attitudes in both statutoryand traditional systems.

0 The Malawi Constitution provides for the right to access the courts, which is in
conformity with international standards of equal protection. However, studies
have revealed that women face enormous constraints to accessing the justice
system (WLSA In Search of Justice: 2000). These constraints arise from various

 

factors relating to their own knowledge, resources, levels of literacy and
education, and the inability to speak and understand English, which is the ofﬁcial
language of courts in Malawi. These factors are compounded by structural
problems including the closure of courts in some districts, the poor services
available in the courts and the negative and discriminatory practices of some
court staff. The inadequate qualiﬁcations of court interpreters, their ignorance of
the law they are supposed to enforce and the overload of work they have, all
combine to complicate women's quest for justice, and discourage even the few
who attempt to seek it.

c There is a wide gap between women's access to justice and the Government
commitment to the ideals of gender equality and the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women, including violence. The.Government of Malawi
has ratified a number of international and regional conventions that deal with the
elimination of discrimination and violence to afﬁrm its commitment. The signing of
these declarations reaffirms the commitment that the Government of Malawi has
on issues of violence against women. However, implementation of these
conventions falls far short of the expressed commitment and the lack of political
will to action these and other conventions constitute key problems that must be
addressed.

0 The Malawi Constitution has devoted a whole section (Section 24) to defining the
rights of women in addition to the general human rights provisions. Women are
explicitly protected against violence, sexual abuse and harassment. It also
invalidates any discriminatory laws and practices. This provision goes further to
urge government and society to eliminate customs and practices that
discriminate against women. Here again the disparity between principle, policy
and action is glaring and the National Response to GBV- Malawi Programme
Report suggests deﬁnite strategies to bridge the gaps.

2.3 Gender inequality and HIV and AIDS

Poverty in Malawi has a gender dimension, with incidents being higher among women
than men. In part this is due to cultural norms and practices that discriminate against
women in terms of access to resources such as education and economic.

Due to poor education, most women particularly the girl child have not been socialized to
make decisions on issues affecting their lives. In this case, young women are unable to
negotiate safer sex practices hence prone to be infected or affected by HIV and AIDS.

Due to their poor socio-economic status, women and girls have taken a subordinate
position to men, which sometimes makes them more vulnerable to HIV and AIDS.

Women are also denied their reproductive rights and have no control over their own
fertility. This, coupled with increased incidence of forced sex, rape, child sexual abuse
and lack of control of their reproductive health rights, the risk of contracting HIV and
AIDS is higher among women and girls.

A recently concluded Baseline Survey for the "Community Mobilization against
Gender-Based Violence and HIV and AIDS Project in Kanengo, Lilongwe” (May,
2007) carried out on behalf the implementing organization, Malawi Human Rights

Resource Centre (MHRRC) has just conﬁrmed a large number of the above cited
statistics— (a full report can be obtained by contacting MHRRC).

The underlying causes of these statistics are obviously varied, complex and to a degree
inter-related, but include ‘the legacy of the colonial and Banda eras which were
characterised by state-sponsored exploitation of the many, by the few’ ‘Economic, social,
civil and political rights were systematically alienated particularly their right to organise,
articulate and participate in decisions affecting their well-being’. The advent of multi-
party democracy in 1994 has given the opportunity for taking a more rights-based
approach to development in Malawi.

This analysis and statistics bluntly point out both the humanitarian imperative for all
stakeholders to be involved as. well as the considerable constraints on development
impact of any initiatives. Any interventions are necessarily going to be high-risk given
such a needy context and relatively limited human resource and capacity base.

2.4 The Rationale of the Programme and its Relationship to the Malawi
Government’s Overall Plans and Commitments:

The Government of Malawi has ratified a number of International and Regional
conventions that deal with the elimination of discrimination and violence to affirm its
commitment. These include the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CR0),
and the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights. At the regional level Malawi is signatory to
the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR), the African Protocol
relating to the Rights of Women and the SADC Declaration on Gender and Development
which includes an Addendum on the “Prevention and Eradication of Violence against
Women and Children, the African Protocol on Human Rights of Women. The signing of
these declarations and protocols reaffirms the commitment and political will that the
Government of Malawi has on issues of Gender equality and violence against women.

The Malawi Constitution has devoted a whole section (Section 24) defining the rights of
women in addition to the general human rights provisions. Women are explicitly
protected against violence, sexual abuse and harassment. It also invalidates any
discriminatory laws and practices. This provision goes further to urge government and
society to eliminate customs and practices that discriminate against women.

Malawi recognises that violence against women is a severe impediment to poverty
reduction. The Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper has incorporated a gender and
empowerment strategy that talks of the eradication of gender based violence as a
specific objective. Additionally, Malawi developed and launched its “National Gender
Policy", which advocates for gender equality and equity and the “National Strategy to
Combat gender Based Violence” in 2000 and 2002 respectively. Malawi also developed
the National Gender Programme that was launched in 2004, Recently, the government
has facilited development and adoption of a National Response to Gender-Based
Violence- Malawi Programme.

All the above mentioned efforts provide an enabling environment for Gender equality
and the eradication of gender-based violence as it is linked to the spread of HIV and
AIDS. This MHRRC proposed programme will contribute towards and complement
Malawi Government’s effort to combat GBV and HIV and AIDS.

 

3.0 The Programme's Overall Goal and Speciﬁc Objectives.

In view of the GBV and HIV and AIDS issues analysed above, the programme has the
following overall goal:

To empower women, men, girls and boys as well as opinion leaders in the target
communities with gender knowledge which will result into community action against

gender based violence and empowerment of Women and the Girl chi/d thereby reducing
the spread of HIV and AIDS. ‘

3.1 Specific Programme Objectives
In order to effectively and efficiently address the GBV and HIV and AIDS issues outlined
above, this programme has three main related objectives as follow:

Objective One: Public awareness, public education and legal literacy

To create gender awareness among men and women, boys and girls in 12 impact
districts and 25 Traditional Authorities of Mangochi, Mulanje, Dedza, Zomba, Mzimba,
Rumphi, Chitipa, Neno, Kasungu, Dowa, Nkhotakota and Lilongwe resulting into
reduced HIV and AIDS contracted due to Gender inequalities.

Objective Two: Advocacy for Social Justice:

To mobilize Girls and women into Action Groups Against gender based violence and HIV
and AIDS related abuse with the view of making them a platform for advocacy on issues
of HIV and AIDS and gender based violence in their respective communities.

To mobilise communities into Watchdog Committees to monitor and report on cases of '
gender based violence, sexual abuse and HIV and AIDS.

To advocate and lobby for positive changes in policy, laws and administrative decisions.

To contribute to the national and global action to end violence against women and girls
by organizing and supporting education, advocacy and sensitisation activities in Malawi,

during the global 16th Days of Activism campaign period from 25th November to 10th
December 2007 through to 2009.

Objective Three: Capacity Building in the GBV and HIV and AIDS fields.

To build the capacity of community based redress mechanisms, law enforcement
mechanisms and other service providers and duty bearers to effectively respond to
issues and cases of GBV and HIV and AIDS;

To strengthen the partnership and networking as well as collaborative capacities of
CSOs, NGOs and CBOs.

To train opinion leaders (religious leaders, village head persons, teachers, women and
youth leaders as well as political leaders) in the targeted communities In gender Issues

 

 

and HlV/AlDS and make them agents for advocating for change in traditional, cultural
and religious practices that impact negatively on women and the girl child.

To provide young girls and boys in the target communities with life skills training with a
view to empowering them to make informed choices about their sexuality and
reproductive health and protect themselves from HIV and AIDS

However, our approach will be to place more importance on advocacy and capacity
building and less emphasis on awareness raising for the following reasons:

- There is in general lack of evidence on the immediate linkage between
awareness and actual change of practice. Awareness and knowledge is one of
the building blocks in how human beings act with regard tovusing violence, but it
is not a straight forward link between knowledge and acting. The change in
behaviour is more complex and includes such other factors as peer pressure and
the punishment and rewarding systems in our society at all levels. if we seek to
promote a change in how both masculinity and femininity is understood and lived
out, we have to be realistic on how much the individuals themselves can and will
change in the short term. While we have proposed that men should be targeted,
we believe that this could be done most effectively by addressing the structures
that hinder or promote change in men's role, such as community leaders, police,
and judicial system and redress mechanims.

- The studies we have described in this proposal all conclude that it is on the
institutional level that the most immediate improvements should be made; such»
direct support to victims, traditional authorities, the police, courts, magistrates
and judges. The dualism of traditional and customary laws and the constraints
women face in accessing the justice system has been highlighted as the main
problems along with the denial of the economic, social, civil and political rights of
people living with HlV and AlDS..

3.2 Proposed Activities

4.0 METHODOLOGY

The fundamental approach to the programme implementation can be summed up in one
phrase: “mobilization for action”. As such, the approach to be used in this project will
be highly participatory. On the one hand, this is to ensure that communities are able to

Village Headmen/women, chiefs, religious leaders and some service providers in the
communities such as the police, judicial ofﬁcers, health workers, social welfare ofﬁcers,
extension workers, paralegal, lawyers and teachers. The trainings will be tailored in such
a way that participants are able to appreciate the issues and take action on the abuses
when they occur or to prevent them from occurring.

While paying attention to the role of women and girls and their groupings (as main
victims of GBV) in the programme, the Programme will also support and promote the
involvement of men and boys (as main perpetrators) in the ﬁght against GBV and HIV
and AlDS.

While this programme will be implemented at a national level, it is important to mention
the following other considerations in the approach to implementing the programme:

4.1 The Intensive Approach (District and TIA level interventions):

currently implementing a GBV and HIV and AIDS project in Lilongwe (T/As Chitukula,
Mtema and Chimutu as well as Area 25) with funding from W.F. Kellogg Foundation.
This project is being implemented under the “Zoom Site” concept which aims at
concentrating interventions in the three TAs. While ﬁghting incidents of GBV and the

Area (T/As Chitukula, Mtema, Chimutu and Area 25) should remain a pilot site for the
experimentation of a number of strategies aimed at ﬁght GBV and HIV and AIDS and for

17

 

training MHRRC core partners. This intensive approach will further inform the
implementation of similar initiatives in the other 11 districts where similar efforts will also
be concentrated.

4.2 The Extensive Approach (National and African-Regional Interventions)

To complement the Intensive strategy, MHRRC will work extensively with a wide
number of CSOs, NGOs and other institutions (most of them members of the Network
Against Gender Based Violence (NAGBV) and the NGO gender Coordination Network
(NGO GCN)) through knowledge management, training and facilitating networking and
collaboration on certain advocacy agendas. The Centre will design a comprehensive
capacity building program for an agreed number of partner CSOs, NGOs and
institutions. Combining the intensive strategy above and the extensive strategy just
described will ensure that the Centre is providing effective capacity building services
rooted in evidence and practice rather than just theoretical and uncontextualized
capacity building services.

At the African Sub-regional level, MHRRC, NAGBV and NGO GCN will work closely with
regional Men to Men Networks through exchange of information and best practices.
Periodic regional Men to Men Symposiums and Travelling Conferences will also be held.
Leadership and Influential men at various levels of the community structures (local,
district, regional, national and African Sub-Regional levels) will be mobilized to
spearhead the fight against gender based violence and the spread of HIV and AIDS.
MHRRC will collaborate with the following regional Men to Men Networks:

- Men to Men initiative under the FEMNET banner in Nairobi,

o The regional Network on prevention of Gender Based Violence facilitated by
Raising Voices in Uganda

0 Men as Partners network in South Africa

These regional Networks will also be focal points and hubs for dissemination of GBV and
HIV and AIDS related information and Advocacy messages at the African sub-regional
LeveL

4.3 A Rights-based approach to gender based violence and HIV and AIDS:

The implementation of the programme will adopt a Rights-based approach to gender
based violence and HIV and AIDS. In this regard, the programme approach will
recognise and be based on promotion of the norms, standards and principles of the
international human rights system contained in the wealth of international treaties and
declarations to which Malawi is a party. Most of these have already been translated into
domestic law in which case they have become legally enforceable entitlements across a
whole range of civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights as well as
principles of equality and equity, accountability, empowerment and participation. By
adopting this rights-based approach, the added value to the project will be in giving
preference to strategies for empowerment over charitable responses and approaches.
The primary focus will be on communities as active holders and owners of rights. The
project will also ensure that, in relation to gender based violence and HIV and AIDS, the
State is committed to putting in place the necessary legislative, administrative and
institutional mechanisms to achieve the desired ends.

Target Groups:

Within the current proposed project, therefore
groups and individuals:

Rights Holders

0 women and girls as potential victims of GBV and HIV and AIDS

men, boys as potential perpetrators of GBV and HIV and AIDS

0
0 poor rural, urban and peri-urban communities
0 vulnerable men and women, boys and girls within the communities

Primary Duty Bearers
o the government and its various agencies and actors

0 public institutions at national, regional, district and local levels (executive,
legislative and judicial) including Victim'Support Unit Officers working in Police
Victim Support Units. Health Centres and Clinics etc

0 local government ofﬁcials and institutions
0 members of Parliament, Councillors and other elected representatives

Moral Duty Bearers
0 traditional leadership
0 church, faith-based groups,

4.4 Geographical coverage and selection of project sites:

The project will be implemented in all the three regions of Malawi with a specific focus on
12 districts and 25 traditional authorities as shown in the Table below:

Seven of the twelve selected Districts (Lilongwe, Dedza, Rumphi, Mzimba, Mangochi,
Mulanje and Zomba) are already MHRRC’s strategic expansion and “zooming” sites. As
a capacity building institution, MHRRC already employs the extensive and intensive
approaches. The areas of T/A Jali in Zomba, T/As Jaravikuba and Chindi in Mzimba,
and T/As Chitukula, Mtema and Chimutu in Lilongwe are the current sites where
MHRRC is intensively focusing its energies to transform the lives of people. In terms of
TlAs Chitukula, Mtema and Chimutu, this is already falling within the Kellogg Foundation
supported Community Mobilisation for Human Rights, Gender Based Violence and
HIV and AIDS project site where MHRRC has already built two Victim Support Units and
will be building a Youth and Cultural Centre in its second phase of the project. Through
the current proposed programme, MHRRC wants to establish VCT services and local
redress mechanisms. ln terms of the other areas in Zomba, Mzimba and Rumphi,
MHRRC has worked with 0803 through the UNFPA supported Community
Mobilisation on Gender and HIV/AIDS project. MHRRC wants to complement the
already existing activities through VCT services and local redress mechanisms while
expanding the outreach of the programme to the other additional ﬁve districts.

4.5 Implementation of the National Response on Gender Based Violence

The National Response to Gender-Based Violence- Malawi Programme Report
commissioned by UNFPA recognises that “the successful implementation of the national
response on Gender Based Violence requires a high level of coordination mechanisms
and commitment from all the players. There is need for a multi-sector approach for broad
involvement and participation of all the implementing partners”. It is in this context that,
in agreeing with the Report, we are proposing the following Coordination Mechanisms
and Operational Linkages for this Programme.

« 4.5.1 Coordination Mechanisms

While the National Response to Gender-Based Violence- Malawi Programme Report
recognizes The Ministry of Women and Child Development, through its Women
Department, as overseer of the implementation of the National Response to Gender
Based Violence it being the national machinery and a policy umbrella for gender issues,

20

 

 

 

the Report also states that “much of the education and capacity building programmes
and projects are carried out by non-governmental organisations". In this regard, this
pggramme shall ensure a strong linkage and cooperation between Governmen,
through the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and the NGOs throughThe
NGO’GCN and the Network against Gender Based Violence both of which are ch‘a‘lred

 

 

 

and coordinated by the Malawi Hche-Eeﬁtre—(MHRRGWW.

activities to be implemented under this programme.

 

(c) The Development Assistance Group on Gender (DAGG)
MHRCC recalls that it was through DAGG that the German government funded the initial
three year project on Gender Based Violence. As such, it is imperative to continue
cooperating with DAGG in the implementation of this programme. DAGG supports
development partners, bilateral and United Nations agencies in integrating gender in all
their work. The DAGG subgroup on Gender Based Violence brings together a number of
development partners to support activities aimed at combating GBV.

(See Appendix Four for Institutional Capacities of MHRRC, NAGBV and NGOGCN)

 

 

4.5.3 The Role of UNFPA on the Programme:

It is envisaged that UNFPA will assume the following role in relation to this programme:

0 As a lead UN Agency in GBV and reproductive health matters, UNFPA will
provide overall technical support to the programme on GBV and HlV and AIDS
related matters. UNFPA may also sign-post MHRRC to other similar local,
regional and international programmes for purposes of sharing lessons and best
practices;

- UNFPA will be the administrative agent and as such will have the overall
responsibility of managing the funds under the programme. This will include
monitoring and supervising MHRRC and other partners on the implementation of
the programme and ﬁnally reporting on the same to the Donor;

4.5.4 Potential Coordination and Implementation Challenges and Risks:

While this proposal outlines the resources (human and organisational), the objectives
and the activities, the methodology, the choice of partners and the monitoring and
evaluation of the programme (see 5.0 below), we also recognize and realize that many
other organisations are involved in the implementation of the programme. LBW,
we recognize that one of the major potential challenges and risks is related to how wel

5.0 MONITORING AND EVALUATION

MHRRC believes that monitoring plays a very important role in managing programmes
of this nature. Monitoring of MHRRC supported partner projects can assist in extracting
from the past and ongoing activities relevant information that can subsequently be used

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7’)

 

as the basis for programmatic ﬁne-tuning, reorientation and planning. It is in this regard
that MHRRC proposes to adopt a "monitoring and evaluation framework and tool" for
use in relation to this programme and the partner projects. This tool will be rights-based
and results-based in focus and will include clear RBA impact indicators.

In order to mount effective monitoring and evaluation, MHRRC will from time to time visit
project operational areas to conduct rapid periodic assessments on both the progress of
the projects as well as the conduct of the project staff. MHRRC will also convene
periodic meetings to review progress. The partners and project teams will also furnish
MHRRC with monthly reports covering issues of programmatic progress, financial
management, and conduct of the project staff including any other relevant aspects of the
projects. MHRRC will promote adherence to certain codes of conduct, financial
management guidelines and human resources management guidelines. A standard
reporting format will be used at all levels of implementation.

In order to assess the impact of the programme and projects, external Mid-Term and
end of Programme Evaluations will be commissioned one-and-half year and three-years
into the programme implementation respectively.

' From a ﬁnancial angle, the Programme will commission annual audits to satisfy itself and
all stakeholders that funds for the programme continue to be used for the intended
purpose.

In addition, MHRRC will use a series of other tools such as the "Gender and
Empowerment Impact Assessment (GEA)” tool and NAC’s Monitoring framework for
national HIV and AIDS interventions to assess the impact of its supported programmes.
This GEA tool will be incorporated in and used together with the Monitoring and
Evaluation Tool for the programme. MHRRC has also already developed and tested a
systematic Monitoring and Evaluation system that allows the beneﬁciaries to participate
in the M&E process. This M&E framework is already in use for the Centre's CEDAW,
GBV, Human Rights and HIV and AIDS projects that the Centre is currently
implementing.

In addition to focusing on "monitoring", MHRRC recognises that evaluation is another
key component to assessing programme deliveries. As such, MHRRC will explore the
possibility of testing and using the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework to be
formulated on the basis of the attached Appendix Five- RBA M&E Framework:
Changes since programme began and Impacts. This tool is speciafically alligned to
the monitoring and evaluation requirements of the MDG’s. For it to be effective as a tool,
it will require to be informed by detailed and meticulous baseline data assessments
which will be the basis for further development and refinement of RBA focused
indicators. .The following are the key components of the Monitoring and Evaluation tool
to be designed and tested:

0 Voice, Participation and Accountability

This component will look at the extent to which people are able to participate in and
take action on issues affecting their own lives; what form that participation and action
takes and what participation and action leads to. Emphasis will also be placed on
systems of accountability as well as on roles and responsibilities.

0 Relationships and Linkages

 

 

This component will examine whether, and how, individuals, groups and
organisations (especially of women and girls) form links to work together and to work
in partnership to advocate on certain issues of common concern

0 Institutional Response

This will focus on how organisations and institutions respond to the issues raised by
people, especially women and girls, in the communities. It will look at the systems
that organizations and institutions use, how they offer effective redress of reported
cases, how they ensure accountable and equitable resource allocation, whether and
how they address issues of inclusion, and how they measure their success.

0 Gains and Benefits Towards the MDGs

This component will look at the data available which points to impacts as measured
against the concrete targets contained in the MDGs.

o Sustained Change

This will assess whether gains made by the programme/projects are likely to have

lasting impact (positive) which may extend beyond the designed remit of the
programme/projects.

6.0 ASSESSMENTS OF KEY ISSUES:

6.1 Assessment of Expected Risks and Assumptions
The following may be the expected risks and assumptions of this particular programme:

0 Willingness of community members and traditional leaders to accept change in
culture, traditions and practices;

0 Political will for the gOvernment to support and accommodate the programme;

a Willingness of UNFPA to continue funding the programme adequately;

o Willingness of MHRRC’s partners and stakeholders to participate in the
programme.

6.2 Assessment of Sustainability

Human Rights, Gender and HIV and AIDS education are process-oriented activities.
While achieving the outputs, changes in traditions, culture, attitudes and practices might
take a longer period of time. The process therefore requires continued activities well
after the programme life. The sustainability of the programme will, therefore, largely
depend on UNFPA’s and MHRRC’s commitment to support this work over a substantial
period of time with both resources and technical support.

In the long term perspective, sustainability is also envisaged as both communities and
C805 adopt and implement effective systems, policies and practices. In this view,
sustainability will be achieved at three levels: political, activity and institutional levels.
Political sustainability will be achieved by drumming support for local ownership of this
project through involvement and consultations with key leadership structures in the
selected areas. At the activity level, sustainability will be achieved: ﬁrst by pooling of
resources with other existing projects to ensure that activities do not stop after this
funding; secondly, the very “participatory” and “mobilization for action” nature of this
programme will ensure that individuals, groups and whole communities are empowered
with information, knowledge and skills which they can use well after the programme's life
span. The continuing spirit of “volunteerism” of 0803, CBEs, Paralegals and community

 

members may also promote sustainability of the programme objectives beyond its life
span. Additionally, MHRRC will use its endowment funds to sustain activities in the
absence of other potential funding for these activities. As an institution, MHRRC believes
in diversifying its resource base and will thus support activities towards joint proposals
and fund raising to ensure that 0303 and C805 involved have continued funds flow to
support their work.

6.3 Assessment of MHRRC’s and UNFPA’s Contributions to Partners beyond
financial assistance

MHRRC believes in approaching this programme from a partnership perspective. Thus,

in addition to financial assistance to the programme, UNFPA’s and MHRRC’s other

6.4 Rationale for MHRRC’s choice of Core Partners, Strategic

Alliances and Resource Organizations.

regard, the programme will dedicate the following personnel on full time basis for the
entire three-year duration of the programme:

programme manager
programme officer
Finance officer

However, MHRRC recognizes that it can make a difference by working together with
others. MHRRC therefore has identified a number of stakeholders with which it will
develop key relationships. Stakeholders will be both duty bearers and rights holders. The
Centre will use the available resources, competence and capacity to influence or
respond to stakeholders’ requirements to effectively meet the objectives of this
programme. MHRRC will relate with stakeholders at three levels: Community Based
Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations and their Networks and State
Institutions. However, MHRRC will have a preference for relationships and joint actions
with Community Based Organizations and other Civil Society actors- both faith-based

and secular organizations that are focusing on Gender Based Violence and HIV and
AIDS.

(a) Main Partners
MHRRC will give first priority to community based institutions. For MHRRC, it will be

Important that these partners organise their relationship to the local communities for

 

programme implementation; that they have the ability to mobilise people as citizens for
advocacy to influence legislation, policies and decisions which are lcrucnal for
transforming people’s lives and the nation. MHRRC's possible core partners Include:

Community Based Organizations (0803)

Network Against Gender Based Violence (NAGBV)
NGO Gender Coordination Network (NGOGCN)
Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP)
Faith-based Organizations

Community and traditional leadership

(b) Strategic Partners

in order to be able to make interventions at a national and African Sub-regional levels,
MHRRC will develop relations with strategic partners, whichare able to promote the
programme objectives beyond the district and national level:

0 Men to Men initiative under the FEMNET banner in Nairobi,

- The regional Network on Prevention of Gender Based Violence facilitated by
Raising Voices in Uganda

0 Men as Partners Network in South Africa

(c) Resource Partners

There are three factors that are necessary for sustainable quality performance by
Resource Partners: legitimacy, specialized competence and available capacity. Possible
Resource Partners include:

Network Against Gender Based Violence

NGO Gender Coordination Network

Women and Law in Southern Africa-Malawi (WLSA Malawi)
National Statistics Office

Centre for Social Research

The media (print and electronic)

APPENDIX FOUR:
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES-
(a) MALAWI HUMAN RIGHTS RESOURCE CENTRE (MHRRC)
Background

MHRRC is a local Malawian institution established in September 1997 and registered
under the Trustees Incorporation Act. The organization is administered by a Board of
Trustees and is core-funded by Danida through the Danish Institute of Human Rights
(DIHR).

MHRRC collaborates with all NGOs in the Human Rights, Gender and HIV/AIDS sector,
the ministry of Gender, Child Welfare and Community Services, the Judiciary, State
' institutions like the Human Rights Commission, Law Commission, the Body of the Case
Handling institutions, Police, Prisons, NonNegian Church Aid (NCA), DanChurch Aid
(DCA), Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM), Association of Christian
Educators in Malawi (ACEM) and some 0805 in certain rural areas. Regionally,
MHRRC has a strong partnership with the Men to Men initiative under the FEMNET
banner in Nairobi, the regional Network on prevention of Gender Based Violence
facilitated by Raising Voices in Uganda and the Men as Partners network in South
Africa.

Mhrrc’s Vision: A Prosperous and Just Society where Human Rights are equally
respected and enjoyed by all

Mhrrc’s Mission Statement: MHRRC is a human rights NGO that is committed to
promoting a human rights culture in Malawi and the SADC region by working with 0808
and other institutions through capacity building

Strategic Goals: The overall aim of MHRRC is to empower grassroots people to stand-
up and claim their rights and take responsibility of their own development. By the year
2009, MHRRC seeks to ensure that:

0803 are able to mobilize grassroots people to hold duty bearers accountable
CSOS are able to represent the voice of grassroots people

0803 are accountable to the people they serve, other C803 and donors
Institutions are responsive and accountable to grassroots people

As a capacity building institution, these goals will ensure that MHRRC is able to build the
capacity of selected C805 and C805 to be responsive to the needs of communities that
are hard hit by gender based violence and HIV and AIDS related challenges.

Project Implementation capacities

MHRRC has a number of successful projects on its proﬁle. These include:

 

Management of the HRCC NORWAY/SWEDEN BASKET FUND: MHRRC is currently
managIng the NORAD/Swedish supported Basket Fund “Promotion of Human Rights in Malawi

 

 

 

Programme” on behalf of the Human Rights Consultative Committee (HRCC). Since 2003,

 

 

MHRRC has been managing the HRCC-Norway basket fund with an initial two year phase of
US$25 million and a second three year phase of US$3.0 million. MHRRC manages both
technical and financial matters of the project. This is a grants facility which is accessed by 67
members of HRCC network.

 

Gender and HIV and AIDS; This project is being supported by CORDAID. The project started in
1999 with a three year initial phase of US$90,000.The project is in its second phase with a similar
amount. The second phase focuses on capacity building of NGOs and CBOs in issues of Anti
Retroviral Therapy (ART), Palliative care and development of handbooks and manuals.

 

Development of the Police Human Rights Training Manual, Source Book and other
complementary materials: This is being implemented jointly with the Malawi Police Service. It
was initially supported by Danish Centre forHuman Rights through Malawi Human Rights
Resources Centre but is currently being supported by the Democracy Consolidation Programme
(DCP).

 

_ Popularisation of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against

Women(CEDAW): A Canadian funded project that focuses on promoting the rights of young
women and the girl child at community level. ClDA is funding the project through the Gender
‘ Equality Support Project (GESP) with a budget of US$170,000.00. The project is currently being
implemented in Mchinji, Nkhotakota and Chikwawa Districts

 

Popular Participation: This project seeks to mobilise CSOs to group themselves within their
relevant thematic groups in order to enhance their capacities in dealing with issues of civic
participation. The project is supported by the Danish Institute for Human Rights with an annual
budget of about US$30,000.00

 

Gender Based Violence and HIV and AIDS through Kanengo Community Policing Forum:
This project was initially supported by GTZ covering all the ﬁve impact areas of Kanengo,
Rumphi, Dedza, Mangochi and Mulanje. Currently, the Kellogg Foundation is supporting the
Kanengo initiative in terms of the institutional capacity while also providing space for linkages,
collaboration and information sharing amongst all the impact areas. The second phase has
funding up to US$600,000.00

 

- Capacity Building/Consultancies: MHRRC has over the years successfully completed
consultancy assignments for Norwegian Church Aid (NCA), DanChurch Aid (DCA), Plan Malawi,
CARE International, OXFAM -Ma|awi joint programme, Every Child, EU Public Works
Programme, National AIDS Commission, UK Department for International Development (DFID),
Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM), Association of Christian Educators in Malawi
(ACEM), Tikondane Orphan Care, AfriMAP (OSISA) amongst others. These assignments range
from trainings in the Human Right Based Approach, Gender, HIV and AIDS; assistance in
development of a country strategy plan for institutions like DCA; development of Handbooks and
Manuals and Evaluations of projects/programmes.

 

 

 

Financial Management Capacity: MHRRC has developed its capacity in financial and
grants/resource management over the past 10 years, with adequate financial policies
and procedures. MHRRC has sound control systems and has competent financial
personnel available. MHRRC has a computerized accounts system using the SAGE
Accounting Software and its accounting personnel has been fully trained in the
accounting package.

Staff capacity: MHRRC boasts of a cadre of competent, highly skilled and experienced
staff. The staff that will be managing this project will be the Director, with a Masters
Degree in Human Rights law, Programmes Department manager, with a Diploma in
project management, Capacity Development Manager, with Masters Degree Women n
Development and the Finance and Administration Manger. Project staff will be drawn
from the functional departments of Programmes and Capacity Development all of them
with a minimum of First Degrees and with more than three years experience in project
implementation and management.

Staff Dedicated to this Programme:

MHRRC will deploy personnel dedicated solely and fully to this programme. In this
regard, the programme will dedicate the following personnel on full time basis for the
entire three-year duration of the programme:

e. programme manager
f. programme ofﬁcer
9. Finance ofﬁcer

h. 2drivers

MHRRC Added Value and comparable advantage: All of MHRRC’s project
evaluations have demonstrated MHRRC's success in its project implementation and
achievement of results. The comparative advantage in implementing this project is that
MHRRC has already done ground work in the areas and will only concentrate on its
outreach and VCT services. There will be resource sharing with other existing initiatives
of MHRRC such as the Gender Based Violence and HIV and AIDS project funded by
WK. Kellogg Foundation currently being implemented at Kanengo in Lilongwe.

MHRRC also embarked on a sustainability process that incorporates a resource
mobilization aspect through consultancies which, as a matter of policy, have a 50%
share to the individuals directly engaged in the activities and 50% for sustainability of the
institution. Such efforts may also go a long way to sustain some of the initiatives using
the Centre’s own generated resources from consultancies.

 

INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES-

(B) THE NGO GENDER COORDINATION NETWORK (NGOGCN):

The NGO Gender Co—ordination network NGOGCN was initiated in 1998 out of a felt
need by both Government (Ministry of Women and Child Development) and donors
(UNDP) to strengthen the capacity of Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to
actively promote gender equality in the country. Among its main functions, the network
was formed with the purpose of facilitating information sharing among NGOs, initiate
capacity building activities, harmonise the commemoration of national and international
events and represent the NGO sector in all gender stakeholder meetings and forums. 41
registered NGO members with gender objectives constitute the NGO Gender
Coordination Network(NGOGCN). .

The Network developed its strategic plan in 2002 running through to 2005 with a special
focus on four thematic areas that immediately transformed into taskforces chaired by
some Board members; these are namely:

1. Gender Based Violence in the workplace
Domestic Violence Bill
Women in politics and Decision Making
Child Rights

99’!“

The strategic plan development was funded by The National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs (NDl). NDI continued supporting activities of the thematic groups
until the institute completely phased out its activities in Malawi (2004). The phasing out
of NDI created a vacuum in relation to some activities that were receiving 100% support
from the Institute.

The Strategic plan was reviewed in 2004 just to assess what had worked and what did
not work with support from CIDA Gender Equality Support Project (ClDA-GESP), giving
another life span of two years. The network developed another Strategic plan in 2006.

Since its inception the network has participated in several gender-related activities such
as commemoration of International Women’s Day, 16 Days of Activism on Gender
Based violence and other ongoing activities on gender based violence.

The network has fully participated in the development of the National Gender
programme that was launched in December 2004. In this programme the NGOGCN is a
key stakeholder in terms of implementing various activities of the programme working in
close collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

The network has so far been supported by The Royal Non/vegian Embassy and the
Swedish Government through the National Gender Strategy Pre-Project Phase. This has
been in the form of support for NGO GCN Board and Network meetings, establishment
of Secretariat and a grant facility for member NGOs to carry out activities on gender
issues in their various target areas amounting to the tune of U$21,000 through an
agreement (Pre—Phase Project) signed in the year 2003 between Malawi and Nonrvay
Governments.

The NGO GCN is currently implementing a MK43million project on various aspects of
gender related issues with support from the Royal Non/vegian Embassy.

 

Vision Statement

 

A proactive and professional NGO GCN that enhances gender equality and is respected
and supported by its Stakeholders.

 

Mission Statement

 

The mission of the NGO GCN of Malawi is to promote gender equality and equity

through coordination, lobbying, advocacy, information sharing and capacity building of its
members in a transparent and effective manner.

 

 

 

Functions of the NGO GCN:
- Build capacity for its membership (gender training and sensitisation, advocacy,
lobbying, computer, research and other skills).

0 Coordinate gender activities through information sharing and provision of gender
expertise.

Lobbying and advocacy
Mobilize resources for the Network and its membership.
Provide linkages with Government, donors within and outside the country.

Identify key partners for the activities of the Network both within and outside.
Develop code of conduct/guidelines for its members.

Project Implementation capacities of NGO GCN:

The NGO Gender Coordination Network (NGOGCN) has a number of successful
projects on its proﬁle. These include:

 

Profiling of Aspiring Women Candidates for the 2004 Presidential and Parliamentary
Elections: The process of building the capacities and profiling of aspiring women candidates
started in 2003 in all the three Regions of Malawi. The project continued and the NGOGCN would
comfortably claim that it has contributed to the current status of women representation in
Parliament of 27 women parliamentarians from the initial ﬁgure of 16 women against 193 seats.
The project received US$50,000 from the NonNay/Sweden Basket fund and another U$50,000
from DFID through National Democratic Institute for international Affairs (NDl).

 

Consultation on the Draft Domestic Bill: WLSA —Malawi initiated the process of the domestic
Bill in order to respond to the increasing numbers of domestic violence. There was need to
consult widely on this before the bill could go to Parliament, it was with this view that NDI
supported the process by providing about U$75,000. At this time when the bill seems to getting

closer to Parliament, there is need to lobby and advocate for it’s enactment and there after
popularise it once it has been passed.

The Wills and Inheritance (Amendment) bill: The Wills and inheritance (Amendment) Bill was
drafted by the Special Law Commission on Gender Related Laws in 2004. This Bill substantially
amends the current Wills and Inheritance Act, particularly the provisions dealing with intestacy
(where one has died without a Will). Despite this position, and the urgency that is needed to
V arrest the problem of property dispossession, to date, the amendment Bill has not been submitted

 

 

 

 

to Parliament for enactment. Consequently, people continue to dispossess widows without legal
repercussions.

 

Gender Based Violence workplace survey: was conducted by the Gender Based Violence in
.the Workplace Taskforce in 2004 revealed that women are prone to sexual, psychological,
emotional abuse due to their gender in most workplaces i.e. Hotels, Multi national company
(Chain stores like Shop rite) or even in some government departments.

However, after the taskforce analysed the findings, it became difficult to disseminate the ﬁndings
because NDI as an initiator of the process at that time phased out in Malawi. In November, 2005
the NGOGCN got U$10,000 from HIVOS for compiling and printing of the report, apparently, it is
becoming increasingly difﬁcult to identify another resource provider to support the dissemination
of the findings to the relevant institutions and find a way fonlvard on this.

 

Networking/Collaboration: NGOGCN while being a network, still believes in networking and
partnership. The NGOGCN collaborates with the Ministry of Gender, Child Welfare and
Community Services, Ministry of Education, Council for Non Governmental Organisations
‘ (CONGOMA), Human Rights Consultative Committee (HRCC), Parliamentary Women Caucus,
Malawi Economic Justice Network (MEJN), Civil Society Coalition for Quality Basic Education,
Civil Society Agriculture Network, Malawi Local Government Association (MALGA), Land Net and
Pan African Civic Education Network (PACENET).

 

 

 

 

 

INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES-
(C) THE NETWORK AGAINST GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (NAGBV)

The Network Against Gender Based Violence (NAGBV) has a broad membership of
agencies including NGOs, Government institutions (such as the Police, Judiciary,
Prisons, Classifications Board etc) and the Media. It was established in 2000 under the
initiative of both the Ministry of Women and Child Development and GT2. This was after
several studies on violence against women commissioned by GTZ and other players
had revealed that the problem was pervasive in the Malawi society. The network was
formed during a workshop convened by GTZ where gender advocates agreed to
formulate a joint gender based violence work plan to reduce incidents of GBV. The
Network was created as a result of work done since 1998 in response to the Malawi
priorities of action following the formulation of the Malawi Platform for Action. Under the
partnership of the Government of Malawi and the Donor Agencies Group on Gender
(DAGG), bilateral and United Nations Agencies agreed to support different thematic
areas. The GTZ opted to support the programme on gender based violence. On the
basis of the experience of the NAGBV and its members, a bilateral project was
negotiated with the German Government. However, the implementation of the bilateral
project had largely ignored the foundation of the gender based programme and sidelined
the NAGBV. The financial assistance that the NAGBV used to get from GTZ eventually
went to parallel activities most of them duplicating the activities already undertaken by
the NAGBV in the foundation years (1999-2001).

The NAGBV has a several successful activities on its profile including the following:

 

Support to Police Victim Support Units (VSUs):

NAGBV was instrumental in initiating the idea of establishing VSUs within Police Stations. In this
regard, the NAGBV’s ﬁrst assignment was equipping the VSU at Kanengo Model Community Police
Station in Lilongwe. A handing-over ceremony was held on January 26‘“, 2000. The GTZ Director in
Malawi during that time handed over the equipment to the leaders of Kanengo Community Policing
Project. “Room One” at the station was specially designated for victim support purposes.

 

Publication of IEC Materials:

0 Several issues of the networking newsletter "Arise" were produced. The production of the
newsletter is coordinated by the Malawi Human Rights Resource Centre (MHRRC) in
collaboration with the Kanengo Community Policing Project.

0 Several issues of the cartoon magazine "Breaking the Silence" were produced in English
and translated into Chichewa (translated version was known as "ULULANI”) and distributed
nationwide. The production of Breaking the Silence and U/ulani is coordinated by the Civil
Liberties Committee (ClLlC) in collaboration with Women and Law in Southern Africa- Malawi
Chapter (WLSA- Malawi) and the Malawi Centre for Advice, Research and Education on
Rights (Malawi CARER). Materials for publication are based on the cases identified in the
continuous monitoring and follow up cases of gender based violence in courts, communities,
media and those reported at the ofﬁces of these agencies, where many victims often seek
help.

0 The curriculum and materials for the training of community educators on gender based

 

 

 

 

 

violence were developed by a working group composed of Malawi CARER, CILIC, MHRRC,
Kanengo Community Policing Project and Limbe Police Training College. Training of
hundreds of Community Educators from several agencies, which provide education,
sensitisation and paralegal support services have been held periodically since August 2000.
Since then the educators have been working in their areas, providing education on gender
based violence at community level. The main output from the courses were three proposals
for community education activities, which were developed by participants for implementation
in the districts of Dedza, Lilongwe and Mangochi- latter extended to Mulanje, Mzimba and
Rumphi Districts. The initial launching of the activities coincided with the campaign on Sixteen
days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence on Women, in December 2000.

 

Holding Training Workshops:

Several gender sensitisation workshops have held for hundreds of participants including
facilitators of the Community Based Educators Training in August 2000.

 

Taking the Lead in the “Men to Men” movement (Advocacy with Men):

in December 2003 the Network through its coordinating agency the MHRRC and with the
support of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, UNFPA and NAC hosted a regional
Men's Traveling Conference (MTC), which brought together men from Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi
and Zambia. The Conference theme was the Role of Men in Combating Gender Based
Violence and the Spread of AIDS. The MTC was organised to coincide with the World's
AIDS Day, which falls in the period of the Sixteen Days of Activism Against Violence on Women
(November 25 to December 10). After the ﬁrst day the Conference traveled around Lilongwe,
taking the messages to villages around Mitundu and Kanengo and the areas in between. The
NAGBV is a member of the Africa Network of Men Against Gender Based Violence, which brings
together men's programmes to support gender equality in six countries (Malawi, Kenya, Uganda,
Zambia, South Africa and Ethiopia). Since then, the MTC has been a regular feature of the
annual 16th Days of Activism and has been rotating to the other ﬁve African countries.

 

Participation in Annual Events:

The NAGBV has been regularly participating in the annual activities of the Sixteen Days of
Activism Against Violence on Women Campaign, the international Human Rights Day and the
World Aids Day since December 2000.

 

 

Holding Planning and Review Meetings

Since the year 2000, the Network had been meeting quarterly to review progress made, share
information and up-dates on the implementation of theirjoint Work Plan, and to plan activities for
the next quarter. Detailed progress reports were submitted, issues discussed and plans for future
activities worked out. Working group sessions were convened to work on different tasks as
needs arose. In March 2001, several Network members joined by other stakeholders met to
develop a Strategic Plan for the period 2002-2005.

The Network coordinating agency, MHRRC, and GT2 as a member of the Development
Agencies Group on Gender (DAGG), committed to do advocacy for the Network Activities,
coordinating the Working Group on Violence Against Women and mobilising support for the
Network activities. The sharing of the lessons from the projects with other agencies had led to
increased support and awareness about the needs of the project and the constituency it serves.

 

 

 

 

 

o The NAGBV members made recommendations as a way fowvard for GBV activities in Malawi
during a stakeholders workshop held in August 2003. Members agreed on issues of capacity
building, training, programme approach and funding/sustainability of GBV activities. This was in
response to the desk research that ClDA-GESP conducted whose results were presented during
the workshop.

Network members at the workshop committed themselves to immediately take up the issues that
were highlighted during that workshop. Unfortunately, this had proved difﬁcult due to limited
funding. In fact some of the easiest and cheap activities to do had proved difficult to undertake.

Hence, the importance of the proposed current Programme which will go a long way in reviving
the activities of the NAGBV.
