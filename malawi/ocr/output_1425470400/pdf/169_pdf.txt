1.0 INTRODUCTION

The agriculture sector remains to be the engine of growth for Malawi in the short and medium
term because of its contribution to the economy. The sector contributes over 40% to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of which over 70% is generated by the smallholder sector. The sector
further contributed 90% of export earnings and provides employment to over 85% of the
country‘s population. Malawi’s agricultural sector is dominated by smallholder farmers who
comprise over 90% of the sector and operate under low-input rain-fed system. The performance
of the country’s economy is dependent oni'how these smallholder farmers perform. Average
landholding size has fallen from 1.5 hailin'l908 to around 0.8 ha today. About 52% of the
population live below the national poverty line. According to the Human Development Report for
2009, 74% of the population live below the income poverty line of US$1.25/day and 90 per cent
below the US$2.00/day threshold. The recurrence of shocks frustrates attempts to escape rural
poverty. The most common shocks are weather-related, such as crop failures from drought and

increases in the price of food.

Despite the impressive record of Malawi’s food security attributed to the Farm lnput Subsidy
Programme in recent years, land degradation presents a big challenge which is affecting
productivity in agriculture. This is attributed to exploitive farming practices such as annual ridge
tillage and ploughing that destroy the soil structure and degrades organic matter, burning or

removing crop residues, mono-cropping and continuous cropping.

Land and soil degradation are major problems in Malawi. Land degradation is manifest through
reduced productivity of the land. Soil degradation, which has two major components of the loss
of soil through erosion and the loss of soil fertility leads to progressively lower crop yields,
increased cost of production and may end up in desertiﬁcation. Soil tillage is the principle cause
of degradation of cropped fields. Soil tillage causes rapid breakdown of soil organic matter
which is the key to soil fertility. The impact of climate change compounds the problem of

agricultural productivity, and poses serious threats towards sustainable agriculture production.

To necessitate broad—based outreach strategies to promote the adoption of climate innovations

like Conservation Agriculture is key.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) situates itself to contribute to sustainable crop production and
food security and hence reduction of poverty in the country. It aims to produce high crop yields
while reducing production costs, maintaining the soil fertility and conserving water. It is a way to
achieve sustainable agriculture and improve livelihoods. CA is a crop management system
based on three principles of: a) minimum soil movement (no soil inversion by tillage) b) soil

surface cover with crop residues and/or living plants and c) crop rotations and associations to

avoid pests and diseases.

The Malawi Government recognises the role of CA in agriculture as evidenced by placing its
prominence highly in the current agricultural operational framework, Agricultural Sector Wide
Approach (ASWAP) —particularly under sustainable agricultural land management. in line with
the regional efforts to establish CA task forces in each country to promote conservation
agriculture, the National Conservation Agriculture Task Force (NCATF) was launched in 2002
and re-launched in December 2007 with the mandate to promote the uptake of conservation
agriculture in Malawi. The task force aims to advocate and influence agriculture policies and
other policies related to conservation agriculture, facilitate capacity building amongst
stakeholders and develop strategies for the roll out and adoption of conservation agriculture.
Speciﬁcally the NCATF is expected to undertake the following activities; i) facilitate networking
of conservation agriculture implementers, ii) advocate and influence agriculture and other
policies related to conservation agriculture, iii) facilitate the development, packaging and
dissemination of conservation agriculture through stakeholder consultation, iv) facilitate capacity
building among stakeholders, v) participate in regional and global conservation agriculture
related fora, vi) monitor and evaluate conservation agriculture activities in the country and vii)
solicit funding to support expansion of conservation agriculture activities in Malawi. Despite
challenges of resource limitation facing the NCATF, since its re-inception, the task force has

managed to implement a number of activities. This was accomplished through activities like field

visits and review meetings in order to iron cut the issues which were identified to be affecting
the scaling out of conservation agriculture in the country. in addition, the task force, through its
members, facilitated the establishment of demonstration plots on the various technologies
promoted under conservation agriculture across the country. Some of the sites include Rumphi,
Nkhotakota, Balaka, Chikwawa and Lilongwe. Other notable major achievements on record
include increased number and strengthened collaboration of stakeholders participating in the
implementation of conservation agriculture programs; increased awareness of conservation
agriculture amongst farmers and people in Malawi on the benefits of conservation agriculture as
a sustainable land and water management option to address land degradation and mitigate
against the effects of climate change, commissioning of a study to document'on Conservation
Agriculture Programs and Practices in Malawi (Impact and Lessons-March 2010) and finally

organising a National Stakeholder Symposium'on Conservation Agriculture in May 2010.

It is therefore envisaged that the Task Force implements its activities under this framework and
in so doing ultimately fulfilling its role of coordination and harmonization of efforts in promotion
of conservation agriculture amongst the various stakeholders which eventually feeds into the
result framework of the ASWAp through the existing linkages. As the Secretariat of the Task
Force, the Department of Land Resources and Conservation and other members of the
Taskforce are members of the Technical Working Group on sustainable agricultural land
management of the ASWAp, the efforts achieved by the Task Force are therefore offered a
national platform at which emerging issues will be brought to the attention and appropriate
strategies developed and implemented. The Task Force recognises that there is need for public
and private investments to sustain the natural resource base for which previous initiatives to

promote conservation agriculture have laid the foundation.

The National Stakeholder Symposium, which was held earlier in the year highlighted a number
of challenges facing the adoption and uptake of CA in Malawi. Some of the key challenges
included weak monitoring and evaluation system for conservation agriculture, limited
understanding of conservation agriculture by many stakeholders and farmers, inadequate

baseline data to justify impacts of conservation agriculture, unharmonized policies and
4

strategies for conservation agriculture, continued use expensive herbicides in conservation

agriculture, poor packaging of conservation agriculture technologies and messages,

unharmonized conservation agriculture messages by various player, weak institutional set up for

promotion of conservation agriculture, and environmental gains of conservation agriculture are
not measured. Realizing the various challenges facing adoption and uptake of conservation
agriculture, the workshop made the following recommendations: a) there is need for the NCATF
to clarify the definition of conservation agriculture to'all stakeholders in the country, b) the
NCATF should commission an independent study to verify the adoption rates of conservation
agriculture through a national unified monitoring and evaluation systems, 0) the NCATF should
explore the institutionalization of a strong monitoring and evaluation system for conservation
agriculture, d) there is need for stakeholders to package different types of conservation
agriculture technology suitable for specific ecological areas and for different levels of farming
communities, e) the conservation agriculture pillars should be emphasized in the context of
available and suitable technologies, f) research and training institutions should work together to
develop technologies that will allow gradual’phase out of herbicide use in conservation
agriculture, 9) there is need for the NCATF to constantly review and monitor implementation of
conservation agriculture in the country, h) the NCATF should agree on the qualification criteria
for qualification for practicing conservation agriculture, i) the NCATF should carryout out a
baseline survey to quantify or qualify the ground data on conservation agriculture in the country,
j) there is need for agriculture extension to integrate conservation agriculture and marketing
issues in their messages and k) the NCATF‘V'should be strengthened and empowered in order to

facilitate the up scaling of conservation agriculture in the country.

The NCATF realises that it is of utmost importance that it addresses these concerns so that its
work to harmonize the implementation of conservation agriculture in the country is
accomplished. Recognizes that NCATF-is still in its infancy stage of development, it will for a
while depend on the good will of the support from cooperating partners to achieve its mandate
in the short and medium-term whilst it will be working on its long-term strategy towards

sustainability. It is therefore against this background that NCATF is submitted this proposal to

5

lrish Aid to seek financial support to the tune of €48,745K'Q‘OOO (MK9.749 millionj). Considering
that there a number of recommendations thatwere made during the National Symposium, the
NCATF has prioritized on a few would provide a basis for a credible and strong foundation of

CA work in Malawi.

3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES
The focus areas for the project support for 2010 are as follows:

a) Development of a Strategic Plan for the NCATF

This will be achieved through a consultancy. It is expected that the strategy will define
conservation agriculture and outline strategies for scaling out conservation agriculture in the
country. In addition it is expected that the strategic plan will be for the long term and hence will
cover issues on research, training and extension to support the scaling out efforts. Furthermore,
the strategic plan will also provide details on the long term capacity building needs for all

stakeholders in line with the ASWAp framework.
b) Development of Guideline for CA in Malawi

This component aims at improving understanding and harmonising the extension messages
through clear definition of CA and the minimum qualification for CA activities in Malawi. It is very
important that the Department of Land Resources and Conservation have harmonised
guidelines which will be used as a basis for training initiatives. This will involve collating various
information on CA i.e. from NGOs, Total Land Care, and Conservation Farming Unit (CFU) etc.
The development of CA guidelines will harmonise various extension messages surrounding CA
in order to ensure that consistent messages on CA are being sent to farmers and various

practitioners.
c) Conduct Baseline for CA in Malawi

The NCAFT will endeavour to conduct a baseline for CA in Malawi with an aim of establishing a
concrete and credible benchmark of CA work in Malawi that will inform effective and efﬁcient
programming of CA work in the country. An independent consultant will be commissioned for
this work to among other establish the proportibn of farmers adopting conservation agriculture

and how much land is under CA on the ground, as per indicators in the ASWAp (at output and

results level). The development of the CA baseline will feed into the results framework of the

ASWAp.
d) Training of Trainers on Conservation Agriculture

This will be done in order to have the multiplier effect following the regional training recently held
in Harare and which targeted NCATFs in the region. The activity will be addressing the capacity
gaps in terms of knowledge and practice amongst members of the task force as it was noted
that members of the task force have different levels of understanding on conservation
agriculture. It will therefore assist in harmonizing the knowledge on conservation agriculture, the
systems and also define what is applicable for our country situation. The training will target both
government and stakeholder staff. Following the training, participants are expected to mount
demonstrations in their respective areas of operation. Field days are expected to be held around

those demonstration sites.

I

9) Stakeholder Information Sharing and Publicity of CA

The task force will also utilize these funds to regularise the quarterly meetings to review
progress in implementation amongst partners as well as development of plans for the task force.
Under this component, the NCATF will also work to produce a best practices documentary of
CA work in Malawi by various stakeholders to increase visibility of CA in Malawi. This is meant
to publicise various CA work being done in Malawi. The documentary will be publicised through
various media outlets like television, mobile vans linked through the Agricultural
Communications Branch (ACB). The NCATF through its secretariat will also come up with an

inventory on CA which will be used as a basis to coordinate various CA efforts in Malawi.
4.0 PROJECT OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS

International Food Policy Research Institute: (lFPRl) which is located within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Security will be responsible for the management and oversight of this
grant. The support will be given directly based on activity request from the Ministry of Agriculture

and Food Security.

lFPRl as an overseer institution will also report on progress of the grant as stipulated in the

contract agreement to lrish Aid. Periodic consultations between lFPRl, Ministry of Agriculture

and lrish Aid will also be made during the execution of the contract. An overheard allocation to

IFPRI of 16.35% will ensure that the administrative requirement is well covered so that the grant

is implemented smoothly.

IRISH AID - MALAWI
Statement of Work for ASWAp/ post CAADP Process in Malawi

1.0 Introduction

Irish Aid is requesting International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to execute a
grant for the support of the post CAADP/ASWAp processes in Malawi. The ultimate goal
of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) is to
improve agricultural development through a coherent long-term framework that guides
the planning and implementation of priority development and investment areas in
current and future revisions of national development and food security strategy. The
CAADP Compact was signed on 19th April 2010 which endorsed joint commitment by
various stakeholders in Malawi. The operationalisation of the CAADP is through the
Agriculture Sector Wide Approach programme (ASWAp). In view of signing of the
CAADP, Irish Aid is committed to support the implementation of the post-compact
roadmap, and ultimately implementation of the ASWAp.

2.0 Background

The Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) is an African-
Ied initiative to reduce poverty and improve food security. CAADP aims to help African
countries reach a higher path of economic growth through agriculture-led development.
This ambitious and comprehensive vision for Africa was kicked-off with the “Maputo
Declaration,” a commitment by all African countries to increase government spending
on agriculture to 10% of their total budgets and reach an annual growth rate of 6% by
2015. As part of the process of reaching the goals of the Maputo Declaration, countries
must go through consultation processes that include all stakeholders — civil society,
farmers organizations, women’s groups, private sector companies in order to come up
with a national plan of action on agriculture.

In Malawi, the CAADP is operationalised through the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach
(ASWAp) which was developed way back from 2007 (initially called Agricultural
Development Programme). The CAADP compact was signed on 19th April 2010, which
marked a milestone for commitment towards a path of achieving poverty reduction and
food security for all Malawians. The CAADP compact has signed by Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Security, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development,
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Development Planning and Cooperation, Ministry of
Irrigation and Water Development, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Farmers Union of
Malawi, Civil Society Agriculture Network, Malawi Confederation of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, Donors, COMESA and AU/NEPAD. The signing of the CAADP
compact signalled renewed partnerships to work together to advance the ASWAp as a
basis for the investment plan for the agriculture sector. The compact was signed on the
basis that the ASWAp needs to be finalized so that it becomes a comprehensive,

 

 

prioritized investment plan. The ASWAp is the Malawi’s national agricultural
development and food security strategy and well aligned to the CAADP pillars and
overarching Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). The MGDS has targeted
agriculture as a key driver of economic growth by recognizing food security as a pre-
requisite for economic growth and poverty reduction.

After the CAADP signoff, the main milestone was the finalization of the ASWAp. The
main thrust for the post—compact strategy and roadmap, therefore is to rally expert
support to the country CAADP implementation process to develop and design quality
national agriculture investment plan and programmes. In view of this the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Security engaged various stakeholders soliciting inputs on the draft
ASWAp. The FAO Investment Centre was also engaged in order to improve the ASWAp
so that it becomes a quality investment plan/strategy. Internal reviews were made,
including editing of the document. Based on such inputs, it was agreed that the ASWAp
in itself represents an investment plan/strategy. In September 2010, the ASWAp was
reviewed by CAADP Technical Review Team which reviewed the document
comprehensively by pillar. The key findings are presented in a report which also
proposes a Post CAADP Review Road Map. The report is expected to be discussed during
the CAADP/ASWAp Business Meeting which is expected to take place later in 2010. The
Business Meeting will endorse the post CAADP roadmap and reaffirm commitments to
support the ASWAp.

Also line with the ASWAp (thematic area on sustainable land management),
Conservation Agriculture has been earmarked as an important investment in order to
ensure sustainable agriculture development. This is also in line with the CAADP pillar 1
(land and water management). Investment towards conservation agriculture enhances
complementary investment towards the food security and risk management thematic
areas e.g. Farm Inputs Subsidy Programme (FISP).

A National Conservation Agriculture Task force (NCATF) has been established to
strengthen the coordination of Conservation Agriculture (CA) activities in Malawi. With
the secretariat under Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (Department of Land
Resources and Conservation) and chaired by Farmers Union of Malawi (FUM), the Task
Force is a good catalyst for harmonizing various interventions by different stakeholders
on conservation agriculture. Strengthening coordination and harmonization is a
prerequisite for efficient implementation of the ASWAp. In view of this, a grant will be
earmarked to support coordination efforts by the NCATF. Specific areas of support will
be guided by the detailed project support document to be finalized the Task Force. The
support towards the taskforce is in line with the post CAADP roadmap/processes.

3.0 Objectives/Scope of Work

The main thrust of this statement of work is to support key efforts towards the
operationalisation of the post CAADP/ASWAp roadmap and strengthening the National
Conservation Agriculture Task Force. A draft post CAADP roadmap (under Annexe 1)
which will be finalized during the upcoming post CAADP Business Meeting held later in
2010. The finalized CAADP roadmap will be used as a basis to prioritize activities to be
supported. The draft Statement of Work document (under Annex 2) prepared by the
NCATF will similarly be used for earmarking support to strengthen coordination of CA
within the context of CAADP and ASWAp

Based on the final post CAADP roadmap to be adopted after the Business Meeting,
support might include the following areas; V
1. Technical assistance related to advancing quality of the agriculture investment
plan, i.e. analysis and refinements of priority areas, the budget, and the results
framework.
2. Facilitating stakeholder participation in implementation and review of ASWAp —
i.e. through dialogue mechanism.
3. Support for the strengthening institutional capacity related to the
implementation of the ASWAp
4. Support for research and policy support relevant to the implementation of the
ASWAp

In view of strengthening the coordination of CA through the NCATF, the following
activities will be supported, as per draft Statement of Work document for the CA task
force;

Development of a Strategic Plan for the NCATF

Completed Baseline Report on CA in Malawi

Development of CA Guidelines for Malawi

Identify and train a Team of trainers for CA in Malawi

Inventory of CA stakeholders and best practices in Malawi
