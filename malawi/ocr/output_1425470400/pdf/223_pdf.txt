environment. including access to economic publications and the internei,

lll Improvements in policy formulation and coordination in tern-"ii oi” in"pletnnnttng nu:tziriornii:: and
structural reforms This should reduce delays in ditiburseinent oi“ that:ro-eu::onnrriic: dominance. and
in turn lead to reduced Go'vernment domestic borrowing to rotation the budget.

ill) The effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation should be enhanced. This would lend to liriitirtived
monitoring of programme implementation, The inclusion of data from impact evaluationt should

' lead to better targeting of interventions and more appropriate prograirune deaign.

Iv) The NAO's Ofﬁce should be capable of fulﬁlling its mandate to effectively manage the entire

programme of EDF Assistance to Malawi. as given under Articles .‘ll‘ll to 3th of the horrid

. Convention. It should also be capable of providing improved programme coordination and more
effective monitoring and evaluation. The Debt and Aid Management lilivition thould be able to
manage the aid program more effectively.

V) Revenue projections should improve through improvements in GDP. revenue and donor aid
ﬂow. This should strengthen budgetary implementation as the budget should be based on more
accurate revenue projections. _

vi)- Strengthened budgetary prioritisation within the context of die Medium Term Expenditure
Framework. Improved expenditure analysis and control should improve the quality oi’ tervices
and ensure that core activities are fully funded.

vii) Strengthened budgetary implementation through enhanced revenue collection and expenditure

2.5 Project Analysis
as from experience

The recent review of the Medium Term Expenditure Prairieworlt demonstrated that thc MTEF has not
had the intended impact. This is because it is seen as an “add-on activity" owncd by tho Ministry of
Finance and donors. rather than as an essential tool for public expcnditurc ntitnagcrniint. This
conclusion is based on the fact that policy termination and review is weak and poorly linked to the
budget process. largely due to poor quality policy analysis. due in turn to capacity constraints. Tho
review identiﬁed the need to strengthen capacity for policy analysis by line Ministries to be based on
existing capacity within the line Ministries. This is the approach taken by this Policy Analytic
 Initiative. The Public Expenditure Review highlighted problems with the. high than: of citpendinirn on
administrative expenses rather than core activities. There is therefore need to rtr‘cngthcn capacity for
budgetary and expenditure analysis both within the line Ministries and Within thc ltcy noonomio
management institutions, The review of macroeconomic assistance to Malawi highlightnd the prohinrn
of multiple and complex conditionalities for donor support. the maintenance of dilicrcnt propararivc
and administrative procedures by different donors and the “lumpiness” and unpredictability of donor

aid flovvs. This highlights the need for better aid coordination. for the donor community to collaborate
5 in joint donor missions and urgently to adopt corru'non procedures.

2.6 Linkage with other operations a

The ' European Conunission has recently stressed the importance of a stable trucro-oconornic
framework to support economic grovrth and consolidate internal and external mamnmonomic balance
(Communication on support to economic reform and structural adjustment. DG Development.
27-03-2000). All donors make aid conditional on good macroeconomic managcmcnt and structural
reforms. Malawi is in the process of developing a Poverty Reducrion and Growth Strategy (FREE?)
which will form the basis for the economic program over the next Five years. An interim PREP was
presented to the Consultative Group meeting in May 2000, The donor conununiry ﬁnanced a M‘l'ilil'li or
