SUMMARY

Countries which have been exporting to the EU under the Sugar Protocol,
including Malawi, will be affected by the EU sugar reforms. It is in light of this
that the EC made the decision to provide an assistant package towards the
adjustment process, in the form of the accompanying measures, which W111
facilitate the integration into the global prices for Sugar Protocol countries.

The project initiatives are derived from the Government of Malawi’s National
Adaptation Strategy (NAS) to the EU Sugar Reform and subsequently, to the
assistance from the EU’s accompanying measures to the Sugar Protocol countries
in this regard.

The speciﬁc EC assistance for Malawi’s sugar sector, with an allocation of
€0.667m under the accompanying measures for 2006, targets three areas of
intervention: (1) studies and reviews of the regulatory framework to ensure an
enabling environment for the implementation of the proposed measures outlined in
the NAS (€0.267m), (2) a Farmer Training and Capacity Building programme
(€0.200m), and (3) an Institutional Capacity Building programme to develop the
management capacity of outgrower service providers (€0.200m).

The expected results of the project are (1) an improved enabling environment for
the sugar cane sector for increased and effective implementation of the NAS; (2)
improved farmers’ skills thus resulting in an increase in smallholder sugar
production through the improvement of cane ﬁelds and; (3) the strengthening of
services to out—growers, so as to increase their efﬁciency With regards to
production in a sustainable manner. '

Based on the above, and also considering the relatively small amounts committed
under the accompanying measures towards carrying out the activities, the
mechanism of support is centralised project support. The implementation of the

' activities will be through a Framework Beneﬁci contract for the review of the
regulatory ﬁamework and a call for proposal for capac1ty building activities taking
account of the gender dimension.

INTERVENTION
2.1. Overall Objectives

The main objective of the EC support strategy is to contribute to alleviate poverty,
inline with GoM policies (MGDS).

2.2. Project Purpose

The main purpose of the EC support strategy is to contribute to the
implementation of the GoM’s NAS with a poverty reduction focus. The Malawi
National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) to the sugar reform outlines two main
strategic objectives: (1) The Malawi sugar sector should aim to increase cane
production and factory capacity, and (2) The Malawi sugar sector should also aim
to increase production through efﬁciency in both ﬁeld and factory operations. The
NAS draw from the medium and long-term strategies which Illovo Sugar
(Malawi) Ltd. has projected to be implemented between 2006-2010 and 2010-
2015 respectively. These strategies envisage. in total_ sugar nrndnnh'nn in h/falmm'

 

 

to increase from 270,000 tonnes in 2005 to over 295,000 tonnes in 2010, and the
to 350,000 tonnes in 2015. '

The project purposes have been built around the out-growers schemes (expansion
and capacity building) having been identiﬁed as (i) one of the mam areas
recognised in Malawi’s National Adaptation Strategy as anlopportumty that the
sugar sector should take advantage of over the next ten years and (11) essential In
terms of alleviating poverty in the short, medium and long term. Similarly, an
initial focus on the regulatory framework and constraints has been identiﬁed in the
EC response strategy, to enable further achievement and implementation of the
other two areas (market access and production of ethanol and electricity). Another
reason that expansion is the main area of focus is that the Industry Action Plan
already sets out to achieve an ultimate increase in production capacity and has
attempted to address, within their action plan, some of the ﬁeld and factory
bottlenecks particularly with regard to infrastructure, improved soil management,
improved quality of cane and investment in health and social services.

2.3. Expected Results

The NAS has identiﬁed support to the sugar industry outgrowers as one of the
most crucial areas needing support (multi—annual plan). These areas include
development and rehabilitation of feeder roads, irrigation projects, development of
capacity management companies and most importantly, expansion programmes
(through loan structures or on—lending initiatives such as the previous Kasinthula
GoM/EIB loan scheme). The NAS also highlights the problem of an inadequate
regulatory framework to ensure implementation and sustainability of the strategic
measures identiﬁed in the NAS. This is therefore a crucial area which needs to be
supported from the onset, through studies and the facilitation of reviews of the
regulatory framework directly, or indirectly, affecting the sugar sector.

The expected results are therefore:

Result 1: Improved enabling environment for the sugar cane sector for increased
and effective implementation of the NAS. -

Result 2: Improved farmers’ skills thus resulting in an increase in their production
through the improvement of cane ﬁelds.

Result 3: Strengthened services to out-growers, so as to increase their efﬁciency
with regards to production in a sustainable manner.

2.4. Activities

The main activities identiﬁed to achieve the above results have been outlined as
follows:

Activity 1: The support towards further analysis, studies and review of the
national regulatory framework (€0.267M for 1 year) is geared towards producing
an enabling environment for the sugar cane sector to implement all the proposed
measures efﬁciently and successfully. The NAS outlines such reviews as essential

 

1 The main areas recognised are: (i) Increased market access to the EU market under the BBA initiative, regional
and local market, (ii) Increased involvement of outgrowers (poverty reduction and rural development direct

impact) and (iii) diversiﬁcation in new products (ethanol and electricity production for sale to the national grid —
value addition to by-products).

 

(pre) conditions for the implementation of the majority‘of the other schemes
identiﬁed in the NAS such as regulations governing the access to land and water
for the out-growers; and thoSe enabling production and use of fuel ethanol and
electricity from decentralised, renewable sources. This Will also be the opportunity
to consider jointly a strategic environmental assessment of the NAS.

Activity 2: The Capacity Building and Training of Farmers programme (€0.200M
for 1 year) is meant to address the situation of farmers’ technical skills-base in
cane farming being still deﬁcient; additional support will provide for a stronger
base for continuous improvement in yields to also be applied during any future
expansion initiatives. A comprehensive multi annual training programme for
farmers at both Dwangwa and Kasinthula will assist in achieving an improved
skills-base.

Activity 3: Development of Management Capacity of outgrowers Service
providers: In order to increase efﬁciency of operation and become more effective,
out-grower service providers need support to build their capacity. This will
include providing services i.e. of ﬁnance, decision support systems (e.g.
Management Information Systems), and training for technical, managerial and
administrative skills. The difference between this training and the capacity
building programme captured under activity 2 above is that'the former targets the
smallholder farmers themselves whereas the latter programme targets the
management (elected representatives who handle the management of the out-
growers schemes on their behalf). The allocation for this project is €0.200M for
ﬁrst year.

Synergies can be made with the 9th EDF Farm Income Diversiﬁcation Programme
(FIDP), which is already operational, and is expected to be further ﬁnanced (2nd
phase) under the 10th EDF.

It is also noted that the capacity building programme, which will take into account
the gender dimension, should indirectly support the overall objective of increased
production of cane through expansion initiatives in the context of loan structures
whose modalities of support are currently being discussed with the EIB.
Possibilities could include cooperation with the EIB (possibly through
Contribution Agreements), which would focus on such ‘expansion’ initiatives.

2.5. Indicators

Three sets of indicators are proposed.

At the Overall Objective level, the MGDS indicators will be used. Progress will be
recorded against a number of agreed upon indicators that will be monitored by the
Ministry of Economic Planning & Development through its Monitoring and
Evaluation Road Map. Indicators will be: '

#1)- Poverty Headcount measured by consumption based on poverty line (MGDS
1

- 2 - GDP growth rates (MGDS #3)
- 3- Income per capita (MGDS #4)

At the Purpose level, the EC/GOM 10th EDP CSP indicators will be used. Progress

“rill kn one-nanny: +1nrn11h‘a TAI...¢ A“..-__1 ‘n W,’ n n 4. -mn

 

 

Annual Joint Country Reviews with other development partners. The contribution
by the Sugar sector to the following Indicators will assess:

- l - Rate of growth of agricultural sector

- 2 - Area and yield cultivated for crop

- 3 - Ex farm. prices and FOB prices compared to regional competitOrs for top ten
cash crops

- 4 - Change in Malawi’s regional / global market share of top ten cash crops

- 5 - Quantities and values of agriculture produce processed in Malawi

At the result level, the indicators proposed are as follows :

Result #1 Indicators

- l — Number of policies and laws in relation to the Sugar sector reviewed.
- 2 — Private & public investment in the sector.

Result # 2 Indicators

- l —— Sugar yields and production areas.

- 2 — Number of trained out-growers using techniques recommended through
training.

- 3 — Existence of a comprehensive multi annual training programme for farmers.
Result # 3 Indicators ‘

— l — Training of all elected representatives who handle the management of the
out-growers schemes. '

- 2 — Level of smallholder satisfaction with regards to management services
provided by out—growers schemes managers is increased.

- 3 — Synergies with FIDP and IDAF.

Results area indicators will be elaborated ﬁuther when the service provider for
Activity # 1 and grant beneﬁciaries for activities #2 and #3 will have been
selected, on the basis of ﬁnal contract signed and grant awarded.

2.6. Lessons from past experience

, The EC, in its cooperation with Malawi, has substantial experience in the area of
rural development and agricultural production, being a focal sector of the current
EC—GoM Country Strategy Programme. It can also draw lessons from
implementation of STABEX projects, which has mainly focused on the tea and
coffee sectors. EC support has assisted in increasing the proﬁtability of both
smallholders and estate by introducing higher yielding and better quality varieties.
In turn, this has helped to increase diversiﬁcation by smallholders, leading to
higher production and increased incomes in these areas.

Other ﬁnancial institutions and donors have valuable experience in speciﬁc areas
of relevance to the NAS. Notably, existing programmes and on-lending schemes
with smallholder farmers in Malawi’s sugar sector have been very successful in
the recent past and have had the full backing of the country’s sugar industry. The

lessons from the difﬁculties which they encountered will be of direct use for the

 

 

MI...“

implementation of the NAS. (For example, the Kasinthula indebted farmers
experience does not reﬂect a 100% success story) 2.

The European Investment Bank also has important knowledge of the sugar sector,
which it has been supporting through different loans for some 30 years.

2.7. Complementary actions

The Government of Malawi (GoM) is currently implementing a number of EU
programmes in the ﬁeld of agriculture that would be complemented by this
proposal. These include the Farm Income Diversiﬁcation Programme (FIDP) and
the Institutional Development across the Agri-Food sector (IDAF). FIDP seeks to
diversify production away from subsistence crops and encourage farming as a
business while IDAF supports the GoM’s drive to become a producing and
exporting nation.

2.8. Donor coordination

The EC is the lead donor guiding sector dialogue in the Rural Development/
Agricultural Production and Food Security sector in Malawi and therefore an
advanced level of information sharing and coordination is envisaged in this regard.
Structures are in place to facilitate both donor-donor coordination, through the
Donor Committee on Agriculture and Food Security (DCAFS), as well donor-
GOM coordination.

On-going or planned activities from the authorities and from other donors include
the following; (1) African Development Bank (ADB) through the GoM ——
Smallholder Outgrower Sugarcane Production Project (SOSPP); (ii) World Bank —
Rural Livelihoods and Irrigation Project; (3) ADB through the GoM — Smallholder
Irrigation Project and (4) Other EU projects: Farm Income Diversiﬁcation
Programme (FlDP); Institutional Development across the Agri-Food sector
(lDAF); Multi Annual Food Security Programme 11 (MAFSP H); Micro Projects
Programme (MPP); Rural Feeder Roads Programme; Malawi Backlog Road

Maintenance Programme (MABARM) and the Technical Cooperation Facility
(TCF). '

ORGANISATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES

3.1. Physical and non-physical means — Centralised management

Based on the expected results and the activities identiﬁed to achieve these results,
and also considering the relatively small amounts committed under the
accompanying measures towards carrying out the activities, for a more effective
implementation and monitoring, the preferred mechanism of support is
centralised project support. However, this is only for 2006, thus allowing a
degree of ﬂexibility in the choice of arrangements for future assistance3.

 

2 Examples of relevant studies/assessments which lay out the foundations for lessons learnt in the sector, include ﬁndings from
the Framework Contract Beneﬁciaries consultants’ report 2006/115952 on the ‘Preparaticn of the Sugar Reform Adaptation
Strategy for Malawi’, March 2006; the Framework Contract Beneﬁciaries consultants’ report 2006/115073,‘Feasibi1ity Study on
the expansion of Kasinthula Phase III, Malawi’, September 2006, ‘The Impact of the EU Sugar Reforms on Malawi’ by the
Ministry of Trade and Private Sector Development (MOT&PSD)/ R. Record et 3] Nov 2005; ‘The Sugar Market Outlook’ by
Illovo Sugar (Malawi) Ltd 2004 and ‘The Malawi Sugar Sector Value Chain (2002)’, University of Durham et a1, 2002.

The planned implementation arrangements for Malawi in the ﬁrst year will therefore involve centralised operations.

3.2. Organisation and responsibilities

....,.J

a..-

_’ The speciﬁc EC assistance for MalaWi’s sugar sector, with an allocation of
? €0.667m under the accompanying measures for 2006, targets three areas of
“l 4 intervention: (1) studies and reviews of the regulatory framework to ensure an
enabling environment for the implem6ntation of the proposed measures outlined in
_ _ the NAS (€0.267m), (2) a Farmer Training and Capacity Building programme 
ll . (€0.200m), and (3) an Institutional Capacity Building programme to develop the i

’5 - ‘- management capacity of outgrower service providers (€0.200m).

- The'studies and reviews (regulatory framework) will be implemented through the
Framework Contract Beneﬁciaries. The Terms of Reference for the necessary
, studies and reviews will be developed following consultations with the Special
Task Force on Sugar including the inter-ministerial bodies, the NAO and
representatives of the Commission. The titles of the studies and reviews will also i
.be determined similarly and will be selected from those priority areas needing 
further analytical work which are already identiﬁed in the GoM’s NAS. '

The capacity building programmes, in both technical and management skills,
>, should result in sustainable smallholder schemes in future While addressing the
weakness identiﬁed earlier (the sector’s lack of human resources to improve the
 efﬁciency and management of smallholder schemes). Both capacity building
programmes (components 2 and 3) are considered as two activities forming part of
one single operation. Due to the speciﬁc nature of this support, there will be a Call
_for Proposals to cover these two components as the prevision for capacity
building and training to the farmers may vary greatly from one applicant to the
other. It would therefore be Crucial to build more ideas on more proposals as
opposed to further restricting the available choices '— this will ensure the bottom—

- up approach we are trying to achiéVC in the ﬁrst plaEe. . ‘
Eligible candidates for the Call for Proposals will therefore be organisations which
have non proﬁt objectives \and a proven track record in the relevant ﬁeld of
capacity building. The Call for Proposals, designed in such a way to promote

gender participation, will‘allow for either both components to be implemented
separately (under different contract) or under one ‘umbrella’ contract.

3.3. Direct Labour Operations

There will be no direct labour operations under this project. ,

 

3.4. Rules and procedures

‘  ~-A11 contracts implementing the'ﬁnancing agreement must be awarded and implemented
in accordance with the procedures and standard documents lay down and published by
the Cemmission for the implementation of external operations, in force at the time of the
3 launch of the procedure in question.

All programme estimates must respect the procedures and standard documents laid down

by the Commission, in force at the time of the adoption of the programme estimates in
question. ‘

External audits are planned as follows: (i) ﬁnal audit at the end of the
implementation period. Audit contracts are always concluded by the Commission
on acting for and on behalf of the ACP State concerned.

3.7. Timetable

The Financing Agreement shall be concluded by 31 December of the year
following the year in which the global ﬁnancial commitment was adopted. Failing
this, the corresponding appropriation shall be cancelled. The end of the period of
execution of the Financing Agreement is hereby set at 31 December 2011. The
ﬁnal date for operational implementation shall be the 31 December 2009. Any
balance of funds remaining available under the EC grant shall be automatically

cancelled 6 months after the end of the period of executiOn of the Financing
Agreement. ' ‘

The Project cost is estimated at € 0.667 milliOn and 'shall be ﬁnanced from the
Sugar Budget line for Accompanying. measin'es for Sugar PrOtOCOl countries.

The contracts and programme estimates must be ’signed' by bOth parties no later
than three years from the date of the corresponding global ﬁnancial commitment.
This deadline cannot be extended. The'above pro'Vision does not apply to contracts
relating to audit and evaluation, which may be signed later.

4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

4.1. Performance monitoring

Given that some activities are to be implemented through a Call for Proposals a
degree of ﬂexibility with regard to the performance monitoring and key indicators
should be adopted as these will, to a certain degree, be derived from the log frames
of the successful proposals. However, the indicators will be expected to be fully‘

compliant with those in the NAS- and accurately measure the three result areas as
proposed above.

4.2. Evaluation

A ﬁnal evaluation of the meaSures and effectiveness of activities will be ﬁmded by
the TCF while grant beneﬁCiaries will be asked to include the costs of a ﬁnal
external audit in their proposals. _ _

Evaluation and audit contracts are always concluded by the Commission on acting
for and on behalf of the ACP State concerned.
