1 - SUMMARY

This project ﬁnds its origin in the desire to sustain the nutritional interventions initiated during
the 2002/2003-food crisis in Malawi. The project will ensure the continuity of the
achievements of the ECHO interventions and complement the forthcoming Food Security
Programme (FSP) for Malawi for the period 2004-2007. Therefore, the added value of the
present project lies in the high degree of integration between the various components linking
relief, rehabilitation and development. Moreover the project will contribute to the Government
of Malawi (GoM) objective of poverty reduction in line with the Malawi Poverty Reduction
Strategy as well as with the GoM-EC Country Strategy Paper.

The project purpose is to strengthen the ownership and the capacity at both national and
communities” level to recognise, to react to and to address malnutrition. The results at
community level will be to adopt and sustain a diversiﬁed household diet, adequate mother and
child care practices and appropriate community based treatments to address malnutrition. At
national level the result will be the strengthening of the national nutritional monitoring system
in order to sustain the collection and analysis of nutritional data.

The project will be implemented through individual activities for the total amount of €6.4
million (€49 million to achieve the results at community level and €1.5 million to achieve
results at the national level). The activities will be designed by NGOs (international and local)
following a call for proposals. The monitoring of the NGO activities will be ensured but a
Steering Committee chaired by the GoM and supported by human and financial resources from
the forthcoming 2004-2007 FSP for Malawi.

2 — Intervention

The experience of the 2002 Food Crisis has demonstrated that the NGO network (international
but also local NGOs) can efﬁciently complement the governmental and CHAM health
structures. The project strategy requires great ﬂexibility and implementation at the grassroots
level. In Malawi NGOs are the most appropriate partners to implement the intended strategy.
Consequently, the project will be implemented through a call for proposals from. NGOs. The
socio-cultural acceptance by the communities and households of the activities is essential to
achieve results in nutritional education. It is therefore proposed that strong partnerships will be
built between international and national NGOs.

2.1 Overall objectives

The overall objectives of the project ﬁt into the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy. The
project’s contribution will fall within the following goals: (i) Poverty reduction through
sustainable pro-poor growth; (ii) Improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable; (iii)
Improving disaster management; and (iv) Increasing gender equality.

2.2 Project purpose

The project purpose is to strengthen the ownership and capacity of both the national and the
communities’ levels to recognise, to react to and to adequately address malnutrition.

2.3 Results

Results 1: The ownership and capacity of the communities to recognise, to react to and to
adequately address malnutrition are strengthened

The NGOs submitting project proposals aimed at these Results will have to achieve the
following sub-results under the project:

(1) The sustained adoption of a diversified household diet
(2) The adoption of adequate mother and child care practices
(3) The adoption of appropriate community based treatments of malnutrition

Under the 2004-2007 FSP, an additional result is foreseen and will be achieved through its
implementation:

(4) Better qualiﬁed Line ministries" community extension workers

Results 2: The national ownership and capacity to recognise, to react to and to adequately
address malnutrition are strengthened

This component will work towards strengthening the national nutritional monitoring system
only. The NGOs will have to achieve the following sub—results:

(l) Timely information dissemination to relevant stakeholders
(2) An improvement in the capacity of national and district level structures

Under the 2004-2007 FSP, further sub—results will be achieved and will complement the
monitoring component:

(3) Nutritional support for vulnerable groups is maintained through
supplementary feeding

(4) The capacity of health facilities to manage acute malnutrition is
improved

2.4 Activities

NGOs will need to submit detailed activity proposals to demonstrate how they intend to
achieve expected Results 1. However, NGO projects will need to operate at the community
level in order to strengthen the Communities’ ability to recognise and develop the means (skills
and material) to react to and adequately address malnutrition. In their project design NGOs will '
need to pay particular attention to the broader environment they propose to work in, taking
account of health and sanitary structures, and of farm and non—farm economic activity.
Promotion of public awareness, especially of the communities’ leaders, should play a pivotal
role towards ensuring the socio—cultural acceptance and thereby the long-term sustainability of
the results and practices. Other essentials messages linked to the health dimension, such as on
the HIV/AIDS pandemic or other sexually transmitted diseases will also need to be
disseminated.

The scope of activities will range from community-based organisation and training, health and

plots for domestic cultivation of vegetables, etc, cooking demonstrations, small income-
generating activities (particularly in the ﬁeld of high nutritive food production).

To achieve expected Results 2, the NGO proposals will need to build on the current monitoring
system implemented by Action Against Hunger-UK (AAH-UK) in close collaboration with the
MoH. This system will need to be strengthened and sustained. The scope of activities will
range from data collection and analysis, reporting, dissemination and public awareness
campaigns and associated training towards the future sustainability of these activities.

2.5 Indicators

The impact indicators are given in the Logical Framework (annex D). They will be the ones
used to monitor the MPRS implementation as required by the joint annual report and the CSP
monitoring activities.

The outcome and output indicators of each individual project will be indicated in their
individual logical frameworks and would be internally assessed by the NGOs. Project reporting
will compare these outcome and outcomes indicators with the ones established by the baseline
surveys.

2.6 Lessons from past experience

In February 2002, the President of Malawi declared a national State of Disaster. A large
humanitarian response was subsequently initiated and implemented. This immediate response
consisted mainly of food aid handouts and the treatment of acute cases of malnutrition. The
assistance was largely organised through NGOs and various UN Agencies. Simultaneously the
local capacity to respond to such an emergency was developed.

The present project builds on the experiences and achievements of an ECHO-funded nutrition
programme, which began in June 2002 and ended in June 2004.

Within the ECHO programme the partners have succeeded in developing the necessary
knowledge in 45 Nutritional Rehabilitation Units1 (NRU) for providing treatment for severe
and acute malnutrition. This programme has also provided assistance towards the ﬁnalisation
of the MoH’s Malawi National Guidelines for the management of severe and moderate
malnutrition (in collaboration with UNICEF and NGOs); it has facilitated the co-ordination of
nutritional surveys and the establishment of a nutrition monitoring system. Part of this
operation was a joint exercise with the Food Security Programme, whereby EC-GoM maize
was processed into nutritional products. The focus has consistently been on building the
capacity of the MoH to manage severe malnutrition in Malawi on a sustainable basis. There has
been excellent co—ordination between government and non-governmental organisations, with
high motivation and commitment from the MoH. Another component of the ECHO support
had consisted of improving the nutritional care of HIV-infected children.

ECHO support to the Community Therapeutic Care Programme is complementary to the
capacity building efforts of NRUs, and provides an additional route towards Linking Relief
Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD). Not all malnourished children have access to NRUs,
usually for reasons of distance and transport or because a parent is required to stay with a child
during treatment at the NRU. The project also ensures the production of Ready Use
Therapeutic Food. This compound is sustainable, cost-effective and beneﬁcial. to the local
economy as the major ingredients can be obtained locally, i.e. peanut paste and oil, sugar.

 

1 Malawi has 92 NRUs in total

Furthermore, the present project will complement the forthcoming 2004—2007 Food Security
Programme (FSP) for Malawi, which includes a nutritional component. A nutritional.
component has been integrated into the future FSP on the recommendation of the Mid-Term
Review Evaluation of the current Multi Annual Food Security Programme (2001-2004). The
importance of the nutritional component was again highlighted by the December 2003 External
Evaluation of 14 Food Security projects currently implemented under the Food Security Budget
Line. This evaluation states “The assumption is that increased agricultural productivity and
increased opportunities for off-farm employment will reduce the nutritional vulnerability of
poorest households. Such an assumption fails to focus on the speciﬁc problem of a
deteriorating nutrition situation. (...) The majority of the projects are implementing speciﬁc
activities that should enable beneﬁciary communities to improve their access to a wide range of
food crops, which should also contribute to a diversiﬁed diet.”

2.7 Linkage with other operations

In line with the LRRD approach, the project will reinforce the achievements in nutrition of the
ECHO interventions following the 2002 Food Crisis.

Moreover the project shares common objectives and resources (for the monitoring) with, the
future Food Security Programme for Malawi 2004-2007. The Food Aid and Food Security
Committee have approved this programme in February 2004 and the signature of the ﬁnancing
agreement is underway. A speciﬁc component resulting in improvement of the nutritional
status of vulnerable groups will be implemented whereby the nutritional support for vulnerable
groups through supplementary feeding will be maintained mainly to address the impact of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic the capacity of health facilities to manage acute malnutrition will be
strengthened through the support of a network of core health facilities.

2.8 Results of economic and cross—sectoral appraisals

Economic, gender and socio-cultural dimensions are key to the success and sustainability of
this project. At the household level, resources are rarely allocated to the improvement of diet.
On the one hand, household ﬁnancial resources are limited; on the other hand, women are
rarely in charge of deciding the allocation of ﬁnancial resources. This fact often emerges from
research into the underlying causes of malnutrition. Additionally the workload on women is so
high that the time available for coherent childcare practices is sometimes negligible. These
important issues will need to be taken into account by the NGOs when designing their projects.

The environmental impact of the project will be addressed through the individual NGOs
projects. The environmental impact of each NGO project will therefore be assessed
individually. In Malawi the environmental situation is very bad. Relentlessly rising demand for
energy (especially for fuel wood for cooking) and agricultural expansion has led to largeascale
deforestation. Deforestation leads to soil erosion and loss of biological diversity. Loss of fertile
soils and the inadequate replacement of nutrients through composting or other means have led
to a steady fall in crop yields. Therefore NGOs project proposals will need to address this acute
problem by speciﬁc activities. One option would be the sustained promotion of the use of low
fuel consuming cooking ovens.

3. Project implementation

3.1 Physical and non—physical means

The project will be implemented through individual activities for the total amount of the
ﬁnancial envelope i.e. €6.4 million, following a call for proposals to international and local

NGOs.

The call for proposal procedure will strictly follow the rules deﬁned by]! the 9th EDF in
accordance with the Practical Guide to Contract Procedures ﬁnanced by the 9“ EDF.

The NGO project proposals will detail the budget allocation for their operations as per a format
that will be provided in the call for proposal guidelines. For the implementation, technical staff
at the grass-roots level will be provided for by the NGOS. Each individual project will have to
make provision for the mandatory external evaluations and audits.

The project will be supervised and monitored using the ﬁnancial and human resources of the
forthcoming 2004—2007 Food Security Programme for Malawi. Under this programme it is
planned to recruit a technical assistant for the MoH and to provide funds to support the
Nutritional Department. Part of these resources will be used to ensure the supervision of the
present project particularly by participating in the committees (steering and technical, cfr.
section 7.2) The FSP will also contain provision for a technical assistant to the Ministry of
Agriculture, Irrigation and Food Security (MoAIFS) who will be in charge of the information.
system). The provision in the FSP for impact monitoring will also cover the present project,
since both projects share the same impact indicators.

3.2 Organisational and implementation procedures

The overall responsibility for the implementation of the present project lies with the National
Authorising Ofﬁcer (NAO). This project will be implemented over a period of2 years through
grants contracts attributed to international, regional. and local NGOs, following a call for
proposals. In accordance with the ﬁnancial regulations of the 9th EDF, the launch of a call for
proposal will be accompanied by clear guidelines deﬁning the eligibility of the applicants and
the required results, as well as the potential scope of activities. An evaluation committee will
be set up to assess the eligibility of the applicants and the quality of their proposals. The
composition of the evaluation committee will follow the guidelines for contract award under
the 9th EDF procedures. In order to gain time in the setting up of this project, the calls for
proposal will be launched with the suspensive clause.

A Project Steering Committee, chaired by the NAO, will be in charge of the ﬁnancial and
administrative follow up of the chosen NGO projects. The Committee will also require
technical expertise which will be provided by the line ministries and especially the MoH.

A Technical Committee on nutrition will give broader technical recommendations on the
implementation of the NGO operations. Stakeholder strongly involved in nutrition such as
UNICEF or other NGO will also be invited to join the technical committee. The ﬁnal list of this
technical committee will be deﬁned by the Project Steering Committee and will be adjusted
according to need. This committee will not be consulted on particular issues relating to the
NGO project implementation but will have an overview of the achievements in order to make
use of the lessons learned.

3.3 Appropriate technology

A partnership between national and international NGOs will be mandatory. This will be clearly
stated in the guidelines on the call for proposals. This partnership will allow the handing over
of technical competencies to national organizations and will secure in—country skills which
were absent before the 2002 food crisis. However the NGO projects will be implemented in, an

environment that is more conducive to nutritional improvement, especially since the NRU are
better prepared to treat acute malnutrition

3.4 Timetable, cost and ﬁnancing plan

The project is designed to cover a two-year period. However the NGO will have the possibility
to propose project of 36 months duration.

The Financing Agreement shall be signed by 31 December of the year following the year in
which the global ﬁnancial commitment was adopted. Failing this, the corresponding
appropriations shall be cancelled. The end of the implementation period of the Financing

which may be signed later.

The call for proposal will be launched in 2 lots with 2 deﬁned ﬁnancial envelopes. The ﬁrst
envelope will be for 64.9 million, intended to achieve Results 1. The second envelope of
€1.5 million is allocated to achieve Results 2. Each NGO project will have its own individual
budget and ﬁnancing plan. No global ﬁnancial plan is therefore available at this stage.

The following table is summarising the ﬁnancial plan.

3.5 Special conditions and accompanying measures to be taken by the
government

No special conditions are attached to this project as it falls clearly within the «Humanitarian
Post Crisis Assistance» and is ﬁnanced from the B—Envelope of the Malawi 9th EDF NIP.

The accompanying measures shall consist of the creation of both the Project Steering
Committee and the Technical Committee for the purposes of improving project management
and implementation.

4. Monitoring, evaluation and audit

4.1 Monitoring arrangements and follow—up

Monitoring will be undertaken and coordinated by the Project Steering Committee with the
assistance of the TA at the MoH and in close collaboration with the'TA in charge of the
information systems based at the MoAIFS.

A standardised monitoring system will be set up and presented to NGOS. Mandatory
intermediate reports will be linked to the provision of pre-ﬁnancing of the NGO operations.
Quarterly reports at ﬁxed dates will be requested on activity implementation, achievements and
main constraints. This standardised monitoring system is the same as that implemented for
NGO projects ﬁnanced by the thematic budget lines.

Data collection for the establishment of the indicators will be ensured by the individual
projects. The monitoring process will ensure the establishment of the baseline data sets relating
to the beneﬁciary communities and the procedures required to monitor the indicators and
measure project impact. This process will .ensure the participation of the beneﬁciaries in the
monitoring and evaluation of the activities. Data from community driven monitoring and
evaluation will be presented in the intermediate reports of individual NGO projects. Outcome
indicators will be documented by the NGO and the reports issued by the projects will present
the trends.

4.2 Reviews/evaluations/audits: procedures and reports

Each NGO project shall foresee a mid-term and end of project review conducted by external
consultants. The Commission will also organise regular independent reviews and evaluations of
programme implementation.

A provision for audit is included in the budget of this Financing Agreement. It is understood
that the Chief Authorising Ofﬁcer, in accordance with Article 23 of the 9‘h EDF Financial
Regulation, may use this provision to organise an independent audit of expenditure realised
under this Agreement. Audit contracts are always concluded by the Commission for and on
behalf of the ACP state or states concerned.
