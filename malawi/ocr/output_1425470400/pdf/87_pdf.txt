IN MALAWI
PRO/300/RC 3 July 2009
Dear Vincent,
Subject: Co-Financing Agreement between Irish Aid and the United Nations Development

Programme Malawi in support of the UN Transformation Fund, 11 June 2008
Request for Irish Aid contribution to UN Transformation Programme (through the
UN Transformation Fund)

As stipulated in the above mentioned co—financing agreement, I am very pleased to report you
on the progress of the ’Delivering as One’ in Malawi. The financial report of the Irish Aid
contribution of Euro 110,000 in 2008 is attached in Annex 1.

While not a pilot country, Malawi’s spontaneity to increase efficiency and coherence, including
the innovative UN Business Plan, are now benchmarks alongside other pilot countries and
informing the policy development of UN reform at a global level.

However, as you are aware, the UN Country Team Malawi has gone through a long transitional
period during the second half of 2008. The former RC left the country in June 2008.
Subsequently the RC functions from June to December have been covered by WFP
Representative, UNFPA Representative and FAQ Representative. In addition, the majority of the
UNCT members changed and four new Heads took up their assignments in the country (FAO,
UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR and the UNRC). This situation made the progress of the UN Reform
agenda not advancing as far as we would have expected. The report of 2008 UNCT Milestones
(Annex II) provides you with detailed information of the progress made in 2008.

In early 2009, with the arrival of the new UN Resident Coordinator the UN reform in Malawi
resumed its momentum and has made steady steps. The successful annual UN Country Team
retreat in March 2009 to which Irish Aid attended on behalf the Donor Transformation Group
set out a new strategic framework and key deliverables for the 'Delivering as One' in Malawi in
2009 and the years to come.

Dr. Vincent ONeill
Head of Development
Irish Aid

Arwa House, 3rd Floor
Lilongwe 3, Malawi

 

One of the most recent achievements of the UN Malawi is the finalisation of the One Plan.
Recognising the shortcomings of the current UNDAF the UNCT decided to develop an
operational document which is inclusive of development activities of all UN Agencies, resident
and non-resident, in response to national development priorities. The distinguishing feature of
the One Plan Malawi (in comparison with all other One Plans currently existing globally) is the
annualised expected results and associated budgets framework. While the annualised expected
results will help the UN to assess annual progress against agreed priorities and revise gaps
requiring the UN assistance, the budgetary framework One Budget will not only increase the
UN transparency but also help in coordination of the diversity of funding sources and
instruments, reducing overlap, and ensuring that the programmatic initiatives and priorities are
adequately financed.

In parallel with the finalization of the One Plan, efforts have been made in other fronts of the
UN reform in Malawi. With participation from the Government counterparts, the first allocation
of 2 million USD from the Norwegian contribution to the One Fund has been made recently to
the four prioritized interventions. Work has been initiated to develop a number of important
UN documents including the development of the UN Business Plan ll (2010~2011), furthering
our work on common services, formulation of different UN Strategies on Capacity
Development, Aid Effectiveness, and Joint Resource Mobilization. The Transformation Group, a
forum of development partners who are supportive of and closely engaged in our UN reform
efforts since the very beginning in Malawi, has been revitalized and expanded and the UN
renewed commitments to deliver as one has been discussed and agreed among the UNCT as
well as with the Transformation Group (Annex 3).

I believe that you would acknowledge all the tremendous hard work of the UN Country Team in
furthering our UN reform agenda. The first half of 2009 has been hectic but very productive
time for the ’Delivering as One’ in Malawi. Significant challenges are still ahead, much remains
to be done but we believe that with the strong support from Irish Aid, both political and
financial term, the UN Country Team in Malawi will be able to continue our UN reform journey
toward our ultimate goal — for the strength of purpose, efficiencies and most important, the
results it can yield for the benefits of all Malawian.

On behalf of the UN Country Team I look forward to your consideration to continue support the

UN Malawi financially in 2009 through the UN Transformation Fund.

Yours sincerely,

Richard Dictus
UN Resident Coordinator
