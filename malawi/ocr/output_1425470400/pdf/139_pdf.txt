2.1. INTRODUCTION

The Episcopal Conference of Malawi (ECM) played a very crucial roie in the events that
led to the political change from a one party dictatorial state to a multiparty democracy
through its Lenten pastoral letter of 1992. Since the start of the new era the Catholic
Church has been actively involved in the social, political and economic development of
the new Malawi. The church involvement in the above issues is being led by the Catholic:
Commission forJustice and peace in Malawi.

In a bid to contribute more effectively to the on going democratization process in
Malawi, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace {CCJP} was established at the
Catholic Secretariat in Lilongwe— and later established Justice and Peace Commissions in
the seven diocese of the Episcopal conference of Malawi namely Karonga, Mzuzu,
Lilongwe, Dedza, Mangochi, Zomba, Blantyre and Chikhwawa.

Its mandate is the preparation and implementation of justice and peace related
programs, paralegal and social analysis, human rights and democracy, civic and voter
education, good governance and economic justice. CCJP is also involved in liaising with
other human rights organizations, NGOs and civic society at national and international
levels. In that role it acts as ECMs advisor on social, economic and political issues. In
this respect, the CCJP is a member of the following networks and bodies; Malawi
Electoral Support Network (MESN), Human Rights Consultative Committee, Malawi
Human Rights Commission, Malawi Economic Justice Network (MEJN), Public Affairs
Committee (PAC) and other international networks.

In 1993, 1994, 1999, 2004 and just recently in 2009 Parliamentary and Presidential
elections, CCJP through the Malawi Voter Education Program, organized civic and voter
education training programmes at all levels, but more especially at the community level.
And in the 1999 General Elections, CCJP as part of the Church/N60 consortium took a
very active role in the implementation of civic and voter education as well as election
monitoring. Similarly, in 2004 CCJP took an important step in providing civic and voter
education to Malawi citizens in a bid to having a free fair and transparent election. In
the 2009 general elections CCJP collaborated with MESN in managing a National
Tabulation Centre that verified with the National results to ensure accuracy ofthe
results and in the provision of Civic and Voter education. in the proposed project, again
CCJP seeks to collaborate with MESN to network and interface with other accredited
CSOs in the effective delivery of civic and voter education and election monitoring for
the 2011 local government elections.

3.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Local government elections are another important ingredient of democracy in Malawi,
as stipulated in the Republican Constitution Malawians will go to the polls on 20th April,
2011 to elect Councillors. The previous local elections held in the year 2000 exposed
many challenges to democratic decentralization consolidation. A legal challenge was
government’s attempts to amend the Local Government Act to allow the State
President to appoint Mayors and Chairpersons of Assemblies. This attempt was
withdrawn after public protests from Civil Society Organizations (C505), political parties
and the international Community.

Various reports of the 2000 local elections by both local and international monitors and
observers outlined a number of ﬂaws that characterized the elections. The reports
singled out that elections were characterized by one major challenge of huge voter
apathy with only 14% of the registered voters taking part.2 Some of the factors that led
to low voter turnout were:

0 Most candidates were not democratically elected but rather imposed on the
voters by their political parties.

0 Re-demarcation of wards was done when people had already registered causing
confusion since the electorate didn’t know how to process transfers.

0 All political parties never conducted civic and voter education to sensitize the
electorate on the role of councilors and need for local government: elections.

0 Funding to accredited service providers came very late in the electoral calendar
which delayed the implementation of crucial civic and voter education activities.
This problem was compounded by the fact there were. very few organizations
that participated in the process and Electoral Commission did not monitor their
operations and activities.

0 Lack of standardized civic education materials contributed to poor civic and voter
education.

0 Poor coordination of accredited service providers for civic and voter education
and election monitoring.

0 The electorate did not understand and appreciate the relevance and usefulness
of local government elections. The roles and responsibilities of councillors were
greatly confused with the roles and responsibilities of MP5.

0 General consensus had also emerged among the electorate that if you vote
someone into power, you are only helping him or her to become rich. This

feeling was being accentuated by the fact that most of the elected
representatives had migrated to urban areas.

There is a general trend as of today that most Malawians do not see the need for
local government structures and processes. To this effect, they are not
motivated to participate in the local government electoral processes. It will be of
much significance to motivate and mobilize the communities via community»

based initiatives to see the relevancy for their involvement in the local
government elections.

in view of the challenges that characterized the 2000 local government elections, as well

as the contemporary challenge, CCJP plans to implement a civic and voter education and
election monitoring project. CCJP will do the following:

0 Conduct civic education and lobby for primary elections and monitoring the

process.

0 Conduct civic education on the ward boundaries —» people to know where they
belong.

0 Encourage political parties to conduct civic and voter education and also field
candidates.

0 Mobilize communities for political participation of women and the youth in
competing for elected positions.

0 Conduct civic education on Elections and Development— How is the councillor
going to enhance area development.

0 Conduct civic and voter education to motivate citizens participation in so doing
address issues of voter apathy and null and void votes.

0 Jointly with MESN, coordinate the joint planning, provision of civic and voter

education, joint review of the electoral processes for April 2011 Local
Government Elections.

The statistical analysis of the 2000 Local Government Elections showed that a total of
1,970 nominations were received by the Electoral Commission. The commission
disqualified 14 MCP candidates from 7 wards in Phalombe because the party sponsored
two candidates for those wards. A total of 131 candidates were declared unopposed.
The high number of unopposed councillors was a clear sign that there was lack of
interest among eligible candidates and therefore it will be quite important to motivate,

empower and train capable aspirants in order to increase competition and improve
quality of candidates.

5.0 IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

The CCJP National office will be the hub of the project activities It will nationally
assist in resource mobilization, coordinate and oversee the implementation of the
project. The SDioceses will be the implementers of the project at community
level. They will coordinate all trainings at community level. This shall be done in
collaboration with other accredited CSOs in the communities where CCJP shall be
working.6

The dioceses will use existing staff to implement the activities. These will coordinate
trainings of TOT’s, trainers/animators and Community Based Educators. The
dioceses will engage monitors on temporal basis based on electoral stages to
ensure that right information is collected at the right time and in a right manner.
The dioceses will be encouraged to network with various electoral partners at all
levels, mainly in the fields of civic and voter education and election monitoring.

5.1. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

CCJP has a well elaborate internal financial management system. Before payments are
made, the Secretary General approves the activity. Then the Finance Officer raises the
cheque requisition. After the cheque requisition has been approved by the Secretary
General, the Finance Officer raises the cheque payment voucher and prepares the
cheque. The Secretary General approves the payment voucher before the cheque is
signed by the signatories.

There are two cheque signatories and two of the signatories can sign at one time. The
signatories include the Secretary General and the Head of the Commission.

Each project funds for different projects are put into separate bank accounts which are
managed independently of other project accounts.

 

6 In this case, a great likelihood is that Faith based institutions like Church and Society of Blantyre.
Nkhoma, Livingstonia synods will be strategic partners for civic and voter education. These have
functional grassroots structures that can be utilized.

10|Page

 

CCJP also produces management accounts on quarterly basis. However, the plan is to
have monthly management accounts to help in monitoring monthly cash flows and in
relation to the activity schedule. The Finance Officer prepares the management
accounts, which are approved by the CCJP National Secretary.

Further internal controls have also been established regarding bank accounts. CCJP uses
cashbooks to determine daily bank balances. Cheques are only issued after confirming
availability of cash balances in the cashbook. Bank reconciliation is carried out every
month.

Regarding transfers to the dioceses, finances are disbursed at the request of diocesan
offices. The CCJP National Office requests the Catholic Secretariat Finance Department
to process the bank transfer of funds to the diocese. The dioceses are responsible for
producing financial reports and liquidation documents to the National Office before
requesting for more funds. The National CCJP Accounts Officer, the Finance Secretary
who recommends another financial transfer after counter signing, checks diocesan

reports.
5.2. REPORTS

CCJP shall submit narrative, financial and audit reports pertaining to the project
according to the requirements of the Memorandum of Understanding signed with lrish
Aid and in compliance with format requirements of lrish Aid. The National CCJP
Secretary will be responsible for submission of all reports to lrish Aid. The narrative
reports will highlight key activities undertaken; achievements made, and key insights
emerging from the project. it is hoped that the insights will help lrish Aid in its future
programming.

5.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION

There shall be diocesan —— based elections management teams made up of CCJP Board
members, management and key leaders for the trainers. These shall make sure that the
national plans for all the processes of the elections are implemented, documented and
reported at a diocesan level then to the National Office. At the end of each electoral
process, reports and reviews shall be done by diocesan - based on elections
management teams reports which will be consolidated at national level for learning. The
Diocesan Secretaries will control budget and expenditure, compare costs with project
achievements, allow plans to be developed within the agreed budget limits respecting
financial constraints, ensure payments are made according to correct procedures and
sound financial principles. Similarly, MESN secretariat will be involved in monthly
tracking of the delivery of civic and voter education by accredited C505.

6.0 PERSONNEL IN THE DIOCESES

The dioceses have their own ongoing projects and personnel of over 75. These, same
structures will be used for this project. However, realizing that issues of elections are
very involving, the dioceses will require the services of additional short time staff mainly
those who will be managing the National Tabulation Centre during the actual polling and
an accounts assistant who will support the financial oversight of the project.

7.0 TARGET

Although the program will be implemented by CCJP using faith and community
structures, the target beneficiaries are all Malawians in both urban and rural areas. The
animators will be chosen regardless of political and ethnic affiliation. The civic and voter
education materials will be distributed to all people.

8.0 COORDINATION] NETWORKING WITH OTHER PLAYERS

The Justice and Peace Commission realizes that networking and collaboration in this
process is very important and that the issue of elections is very crucial and involving and
they require coordinated efforts. Realizing this, CCJP will strengthen its networks and
collaboration with stakeholders and players in the electoral process. Through these
networks and regular meetings, the CCJP shall share the information and experience on
the electoral process, challenges and achievements and way forward. In this case CCJP
will closely work with Malawi Electoral Support NetworkiMESNj so that civic
education and all electoral related issues are well coordinated and shared with
other stakeholders.

9.0 PROJECT RISK ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

The Local Government Civic and Voter Education Project shall be implemented in the
context which demands C505 and CCJP in particular to be vigilant and proactive. The
success of this project hinges on the following variables: Primarily, since the constitution
empowers the president to decide the dates for elections, the actual dates for elections
may change depending on political reasons. In this case, therefore, it is important to
assume the possibility of postponing the elections by government. In our work as CCJP,
it will be critical to keep on lobbying for continuity of preparations as well as seeking
assurance that the dates won’t be changed. CCJP will go as far as seeking the
intervention of the Catholic Bishops and other faith leaders to a joint campaign for
holding local polls.

On the other hand, the recent situation where MEC has been suspended does not help
the situation either. Many players in these elections feel disoriented as MEC is very
central to the elections. CCJP will collaborate with MESN to lobby government to put in

12|Pagc

 

place an interim commission to oversee the electoral processes that are a must before
the polling day in April next year. Bringing together various elections stakeholders will
be done to mount pressure on government to act timely on the existence and
functionality of MEC.

Another major risk is the whole probability that elections may not take place as planned
(government has shown lack of interest in local elections). Using the available resources
for civic and voter education for local elections, CCJP shall in turn, seel: to utilize the
resources for a laudable advocacy campaign towards getting new commitment from
government for the elections. Furthermore, CCJP shall seek to lobby various
stakeholders including parliamentarians to reverse the amended local government: act
into its original framing that specifically puts dates for local polls.
