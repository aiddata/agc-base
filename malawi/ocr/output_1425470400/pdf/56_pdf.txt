1 SUMMARY

The overall objective of the Income Generation Public Work, Programme (flGPWP) is to
contribute to the Malawi Government’s objective of poverty reduction in. line with the
Malawian Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP).

The IGPWP will use lessons learnt from the Government of Malawi  European Union Public
Work Programme (GoM/EU PWP) and the Multi Annual Food Security Progranzime (MAI—TSP)
to implement a labour intensive programme with the aim of promoting income generating
activities as well as productive activities for the rural and peri—urban poor, assisting them to
promote sustainable livelihoods. The following thematic or crosscutting themes will be
addressed: HIV/AIDS, gender issues, environmental issues and ii‘istitutional development and.
capacity building.

The project purpose is to enhance the socio—economic situation of the rural,»"per:i-urban
population through improving accessibility, infrastructure and promotion of productive
activities within rural/peri-urban areas and by creating linkages to economic activities.

The IGPWP will build on the achievements of the GoM/Elj PWP by enabling the poor both
improved access as well as increased income through community based road rehabilitation and
road maintenance, forestry and irrigation development. A major emphasis of the l'GPW P is to
provide a link b etween income generation and productive a ctivities within the c ommunities
through practical and sustainable approaches.

Apart from improved access to markets and social facilities, through improving roads, people
living with HIV/AIDS will also beneﬁt from the programme as the their guardians will.
increase their incomes through participating in this programme. In some areas, where
HIV/AIDS support groups exist, they will be linked to the project directly. The project will
indirectly increase the capacities of the District Assemblies (DA) in management of public
works.

The IGPWP will be implemented over a period of five years in two phases. The reason for
having a five years programme is to ensure the scaling—up of the Districts Assemblies
involvement and of the GoM contribution. The first 3 years will be used to strengthen capacity
at DA level. In the second phase, the DA will directly implement most of the activities itself.
Furthermore, in order to ensure the sustainability of the assets created, the transfer of funds
from the GoM to maintain them is a precondition to start the 2nd. phase.

The whole programme, which received a favourable opinion of the EDF Committee, is
anticipated to last for 5 years in two phases, with a total EDF contribution of €25 million.

This FA only covers the 1st Phase of the whole programme for an amount ofE l5,5l 2,500 and
an operational implementation period of 36 months. A 2nd PA is expected to be signed
following a new Commission’s decision for an operational implementation period of 24
months and an amount of € 9,487,500

 

2. INTERVENTION

2.1 Overall objective

The overall objective of the IGPWP is to contribute to the GoM’s poverty reduction objective
in line with the MPRSP. The IGPWP will use lessons learnt from PWP to implement a labour
intensive programme with the aim of promoting income generating activities as well as
productive activities for the rural and pen-urban poor, assisting to promote sustainable
livelihoods.

2.2 Programme purpose

The project purpose is to enhance the socio-economic situation of the rural/pen—urban
population through improving accessibility, infrastructure and promotion of productive
activities within rural/peri-urban areas and by creating linkages to economic activities.

The lGPWP will build on the gains made in PWP by enabling the poor both improved access
as well as income through community based road rehabilitation and road maintenance, forestry
and irrigation development. A major emphasis of the IGPWP is to provide a link between
income generation and productive activities within the communities through practical and
sustainable approaches.

2.3 Expected results

Result 1 - Rural roads are upgraded and rehabilitated

The communities will be involved in appropriate income injection activities tlu‘ough. labour
intensive m ethods, which W ill result in upgrading and rehabilitation o f t he r oads (including
bridges and culverts) in the vicinity of the beneﬁciary villages/communi ties.

Result 2 — Rural roads are maintained

Village road maintenance clubs will be formed and will be involved in appropriate income
injection activities through labour intensive methods, which will result in ongoing maintenance
in the vicinity of the beneﬁciary villages/ communities.

Result 3 — Productive local forestry activities are developed (comprising fuel wood, timber
and fruit tree plantations)

Communities will be encouraged to form village forestry clubs, who will be empowered
regarding the benefits of reforestation/tree planting and will be provided with inputs and
training so that they can create their own tree nurseries and tree plantations (both communal
and individual as appropriate).

Result 4 - Productive local agricultural activities are developed through improved inputs
and irrigation

Communities will be encouraged to form village irrigation clubs, who will be empowered
regarding the beneﬁts of irrigation activities. The clubs will be assisted to initiate a variety of
demand (1 riven which w ill improve s ustainability and r esult in improved income generation
from surplus food grown. Irrigation schemes will comprise stream diversions. canals and
storage ponds linked to aquaculture as appropriate etc.

Result 5 — Implementation capacity of district assemblies is enhanced

The implementation of the IGPWP will be ensured by the DA3 once they have the appropriate
capacity to do so. The capacity of the DA5 will be enhanced both through coordination and by
direct provision of capacity building relating to development planning and implementation.
This capacity building component will be the core activities for the 3 years and assessed at this
end of the first phase. In the second phase the DA will be enabled to manage the road
maintenance funds including the part for public ﬁnance (as per precondition of the 2nd phase).

v
a

Result 6 - Project management is adequately addressing crosscutting issues

The programme management unit for the lGPWP will be constituted in such a way to pay

particular attention to essential crosscutting issues such as HDUAIDS and gender and access to

other opportunities. Some sub—results are expected such as: I

HIV/AIDS awareness is promoted: The lGPWP will facilitate linkages between. the
beneﬁciary communities and HIV/AIDS programmes."'initiatives, so that: the communities
derive beneﬁts from these as well. The village clubs will form an ideal forum for HIV,lele
programmes to engage with the communities, thus improving the linkage between
communities and HIV/AIDS initiatives.

Role of women and youth in household income generation and decision-making is
increased: Speciﬁc targets will be set and monitored for employment and representation of
women and youth. Thus women and youth will earn income as they participate in the
IGPWP activities and will be represented in decision—making forums.

Linkages are facilitated to other socio—economic activities for the rural poor: The IGP'WP
will facilitate linkages between the beneﬁciary communities and other willing development
prograrrnnes/initiatives, so that the communities derive beneﬁts not only from the lG-PWP,
but from the other programmes as well.

Moreover, the programme management unit for the lGPWP will be constituted in such a way
that it will create opportunities for local programme and project managers A Malawian
programme manager will head the Programme Management. Unit (PMU) and. local consultants
Will be appointed to carry out project management work, and thus enhance their skills and
experience.

2.4. - Activities

The IGPWP will be implemented in two phases: the ﬁrst one of three years and the second of
two years. (Please refer to Annex 2 for more details on the timetable for activities.)
The ﬁrst 3 years will be used to strengthen the DA capacity. In the second phase, the DA will
directly implement most of the activities. Furthermore in order to ensure the sustainability of
the assets created, it is essential the Government of Malawi transfer the funds to maintain them.
It is foreseen that the GoM’s ﬁnancial contribution will be represented as follows:

- Year 4: 50 % of the requested funds to maintain the roads rehabilitated in. the ﬁrst phase

0 Year 5: 100% of the requested funds to maintain the roads rehabilitated in the ﬁrst

phase

. .
Therefore, the 5 years” period is a necessary duration to, on one hand, strengthen, the capacity
of the DA to implement the activities and on other hand, to scale up the G-OM contribution in
the rural road under DA responsibility maintenance.
This programme is a ﬁve years comprehensive project, most of the activities under phase II
will depend on the outputs of phase I and ﬂexibility is a major requirement for proper action.
As a consequence there is a high probability that several activities could not be undertaken and
funds committed before the end of the date+3 rule, justifying the two phases approach.

Main activities planned for the two phases of implementation are as follows:
Phase I:

This ﬁrst phase will put into place the conditions to enable to carry out the activities planned
for this phase and also set the stage for the second phase during which the main activities of the

programme will be continued. The process is to be demand driven and to be a bottom—up
approach.

The activities related to the expected results that will be ongoing in the first phase are listed

below:
0

Roads will be identiﬁed, prioritised and selected for upgrading in collaboration with
the DA’s, based upon the District Development Plans (DDPs) and the Village
Development Committees (VDCs) along the selected roads will be consulted,
Contractors and the community workforce will be provided with technical assistance
to carry out the work required.

In consultation with the DAS and VDCs, village road maintenance clubs will be
formed (including setting up a bank account), equipped, capacitated and trained in the
work required for ongoing maintenance of the roads (approximately 10 km per
village). At the end of the second year of maintenance, the maintenance activities will
be handed over to the DAs for them to take over responsibility.

The VDCs will be consulted and on the basis of positive response (demand) village
forestry clubs will be formed, equipped, supplied with inputs, capacitated and trained
in forestry husbandry (nursery development, planting out, and management and
maintenance of plantations).

The VDCs will be consulted and on the basis of positive response (demand) village
irrigation clubs will be formed, equipped, supplied with inputs, capacitated and trained
in irrigation techniques.

The PMU will consult with DAs and other donor programmes with regard to the
capacity building needed to adequately implement the IGPWP. Capacitating plans will
be formulated, approved by the DAs and PSC and then implemented by the PMU.
Based upon the proven capacity of the DA5, functions within the IGPWP will be
incrementally handed over from the 13‘?th to the DAs.

- Crosscutting issues:

- HIV/AIDS awareness is promoted The PMU will consult DAs and HIV/AIDS
programmes, cooperation agreements will be entered into with willing partners, in
order to maximize coordination and cooperation between the IGPPW and already
existing HIV/AIDS programmes. Joint planning forums will be established.

0 Role of women and youth is increased: The PMU will consult with the Village
Development Committees (VDCs) and obtain commitment for the inclusion of
women and youth within the income generating activities (road rehabilitation 
maintenance) as well as representation in the various committees and clubs,
Income received and involvement of women, and youth will. be monitored.

- Linkages are facilitated to other socio-economic activities: The PMU will
consult DAs and other donor programmes; cooperation agreements will be
entered into with willing partners, in order to maximize coordination and
cooperation between the IGPPW and other initiatives. Joint planning forums will
be established. During the consultation and implementation of the IGPWP at
village level, other programmes will be introduced to the community.

Training plans for PMU staff will be formulated in terms of which the TAT (Technical
Assistance Team) will provide specific training to the PMU staff. Local consultants will be
selected and appointed to plan and oversee the implementation of roads projects and will be
provided with technical assistance by the TAT.

A review of the programme’s logical framework will be carried out through a consultative
process with stakeholders at the end of the first phase to ensure that the contextual

 

environment, within which the programme is set, remains valid. Any revision will be agreed
with, and approved by, programme stakeholders, the GoM and the EC. An external evaluation
at the end ofthe first implementation phase will also be carried out, the successful outcome of
which will be the trigger for the second phase.

Ph asc II:

Programme pr0cess and activities under phase 2 will be developed as the outcome of the
evaluation of phase 1 but will mainly be a continuation of the activities already carried out
during the first phase. The programme should retain sufficient ﬂexibility to be able to respond
to the changing demands of stakeholders and adapt to the local environment. Ongoing
monitoring and observance of the original broad parameters of the programme should. however
be maintained in order to retain focus on the link between, output and purpose.

2.5 Indicators

The key indicators for assessing the success of the programme are listed in, relation to the
different results in the Logical Framework (Annex 3). The indicators will be used to measure
the outputs of the different activities, their direct effects on the beneficiaries and the change
that they influence in the livelihoods of the recipient communities. Assessment will be done
through the implementation of a project and programme monitoring systems. To assess the

impact and the outcome of the project, the indicators will be compared with those in the
baseline surveys.

An independent Monitoring Contractor (MC) will monitor the l'GPWP. The MC will be
responsible for establishing a monitoring and information system (MIS) within the first six
months of operation linked to t e output reports required by GoM and the EU.

A set of indicators have been established to be used to measure the performance,”
accomplishment of the activities at the end of phase I and will be used as the trigger of The
second phase (see annex 7b).

3. IMPLEMENTATION

3.1. Physical and non physical means

Physical means shall include rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads and small—
scale communal irrigation schemes using labour intensive methods, as well as facilitation of
inputs for forestry and irrigation productive activities.

Non-physical means include facilitation, coordination, management and monitoring. The
responsibility for the programme Will he with the Department of Local Government (DLG) and
the programme will be managed through a Programme Management Unit (PMU), supported by
relevant Technical Assistance (TA). Technical assistance will be provided to the programme in
the form of long-term TA throughout the 5-year period. The areas of expertise will be:
Programme Management, Road Construction, Irrigation and Agriculture, Financial
Management. In addition, there will be a need for short-term TA to support particular
activities. An independent monitoring contractor (MC) will carry out a monitoring system over
the 5—year period. Local consultants will be contracted to design and oversee the roads
components in support of DAs.

3.2 Organisational and implementation procedures
The overall responsibility for the implementation of the programme lies with the National
Authorising Officer (NAO).

 

In accordance with Article 35(1) of Annex TV to the Cotonou Agreement, the N40 will
delegate to the Department of Local Government (DI. G), programme supervisor, his powers
of implementation. The detailed modalities of this delegation, including the exact level of
powers, authorised thresholds for public procurement and grants delegated by the NAG to the
Irnprest Administrator (IA) and/or the Accounting Ofﬁcer (A0), will be defined in. the overall
work plan and the annual work plans/cost estimates in respect of the 9m EDP regulations.

A Programme Steering Committee (PSC) will be set up to oversee and validate the overall
direction and policy of the programme, and to follow all programme activities and budget The
PSC will meet at least twice a year. It will be responsible for approving the programme-
estimates drawn up by the LA and the A0.

The PSC will be chaired by the NAG or a representative and will consist of a representative of
the MOAIFS project supervisor, the IA and the A0 for the project designated in the
programme—estimates, a representative of the EU Delegation, with observer status.

Representation from NGOs, the civil society and all involved line ministries will also be part of
the PSC.

A Programme Management Unit (PM U) will be established under the authority of the DLG.
Programme-estimates for operations Will be conducted under direct labour. The preparation,
management and implementation of the programme—estimates must comply with rules set out

in the Practical guide to management of direct-labour operations and prograinmeoestimates
ﬁnanced by the EDF.

The long term Technical Assistance (TA) t0 the programme will be recruited following the
International restricted tender procedure. The call for tender will cover the whole duration. of
the 2 phases programme, however a special clause will specify that an extension to the contract
may be awarded to cover the 2nd phase of the programme ﬁnanced from the resources of the 2“
FA, subject to the signature of this FA and a positive assessment of the contractors
performances to be conducted at least six months before the end of the first contract. Should

the performance assessment prove negative a new recruitment will be conducted following the
initial procedure.

All call for tenders and contracts will b e c onducted in accordance with 9 th EDP rules and
procedures.

The NAO Support Unit has been set up with EU funds and its function is to provide support
to EU funded programmes at all stages, including this one. The role and responsibilities of the
NAG Support Unit include ensuring that the programme is implemented following the rules
and regulations of 9th EDF procedures. Backstopping by the designated Desk Ofﬁcer(s) in the
NAG Support Unit will also help facilitate the smooth running of the programme.

The PMU will contract civil contractors to implement the roads projects and with the DA5
will act as implementing agents to facilitate the forestry and irrigation, components (as well as
roads projects) based on capacity of DAs. Details of the institutional arrangements are included
in Annex 9.

An independent monitoring contractor (MC) will carry out a monitoring system over the 5—
vear period. Local consultants will be contracted to design and oversee the roads components
in support of DAs.

 

A

The programme will be implemented within the existing framework for decentralisation.
The Districts Assembly will be progressively assisted to take over project planning and
implementation functions. A national PMU with long—term fulltime as well as short—term TA.
will be deployed, with roles of each clariﬁed properly.

3.3 Appropriate technology

The use of appropriate technologies that are more enviromnentally friendly, sustainable and
suited to indigenous skills and ﬁnancial resources shall be promoted in the programme. The
programme shall give emphasis to the lessons learnt and the experiences of other projects
where such activities have been used. Appropriate labour intensive methods will be used
together with local materials wherever feasible.

3.4 Timetable, cost and ﬁnancing plan

The whole programme is designed to cover a ﬁve-year period, split into two phases.

A single ﬁnancing proposal (FF) for the full amount covering the entire period of execution of
the programme was submitted to the EDF committee for opinion.

For each phase a Commission’s ﬁnancing decision will be taken for the amount allocated to
each phase and a ﬁnancing agreement (FA) signed for the same amount, covering the
corresponding period of execution.

For each phase the FA shall be concluded by 31 December of the year following the year in
which the global ﬁnancial commitment was adopted. Failing this, the corresponding
appropriations shall be cancelled.

This FA is signed for the ﬁrst phase only.

For the purpose of Article 4 of the Special Conditions of the Financing Agreement, the date of
the end of the period of operational implementation of the 1St FA is set at 31/12/2009 and
the date of the end of period of execution of the 1St FA is hereby set at 31/12/2011. Any
balance of funds remaining available under the E C grant shall be automatically c ancelled 6
months after the end of the period of execution of the Financing Agreement.

For the purposes of Article 5 of the Special Conditions of the Financing Agreement, contracts
and programme estimates must be signed by both parties, no later than three years from the
date of the corresponding global ﬁnancial commitment. This deadline cannot be extended. The
above p rovision d oes n 0t apply to c ontracts r elating to a udit and e valuation, which may b e
signed later.

A 2"d FA will be signed for the second phase after assessment of the ﬁrst phase:

The Commission’s decision covering the second phase and signature of the relevant. FA will be
subject to conﬁrmation by an evaluation of the programme carried out two years after
implementation of the ﬁrst phase. The evaluation may propose adjustment for the second phase
providing that it does not modify the ‘sprit of the initial programme’s FP’.

From a total project cost estimated at € 25 million ﬁnanced from the resources of the A
envelope of the NTP, € 15.5 million are allocated to this FA covering phase 1.

3.5 Special conditions and accompanying measures to be taken by the government
Special conditions will have to be fulﬁlled by GoM before commencement of phase 1 of the
programme:

1. Good ensures that there is requisite capacity in DAs to implement road mainl.;nance projects;
2. GoM is committed to fulﬁl the preconditions for phase II (.ee preconditions 3 «5': 4 below);
Specific triggers to inform commencement of the IGPWP second phase wi ll be:

3. GoM creates a road maintenance fund - with approved disbursement procedures - at district
level during the ﬁrst phase. The fund is to be established prior to the signing of the 2nd
Financing Agreement.

4. Each DA is allocated sufﬁcient funds to maintain those roads upgraded during the first phase
of lGPWP. 50% of the requested funds shall be GoM contribution. This precondition is to be in
place before activities commence under the 2nd Financing Agreement.

4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

4.1 Monitoring arrangements and follow-up

An independent Monitoring Contractor (MC) will monitor the IGPWP. The MC will be
responsible for establishing a monitoring and information system (MIS‘) within the ﬁrst six,
months of operation linked to the output reports required by 60M and the EU.

The typical indicators to be incorporated within the system are set down. in Amie); 6. An
important principle is that the IGPVJP MIS integrates with the systems used by the DAs and
MASAF, so that common data sets can be shared. The MC must also establish a baseline
survey Within the ﬁrst year against which impact of the programme can be measured. Gender
analysis will be also being part of the monitoring systems.

l
l

4.2 Reviews, evaluations and audits

External technical monitoring and evaluation reviews shall be undertaken on an annual basis
by an independent international team of consultants selected by the NAG. There shall be a mid—
term and end of programme review conducted by external consultants selected by the EU. The
evaluation/assessment of the first phase will be canied out and act as the trigger for the second
phase. Speciﬁc indicators will be used to measure performance of this first phase.

In any event, when total expenditure incurred by the direct-labour component of programme-
estimates is € 200,000 or more. the expenditure has to be ﬁnancially audited. before submission
of the closure report.

Audits must be carried out by approved auditors who are members of an intemationally
recognised auditing certiﬁcation association. Their job is to verify the programme’s accounts
and certify that the expenditure by the direct-labour component of the programme—estimates
was committed, validated and paid in accordance with the progrannne of measures. the budget
estimated and the technical and administrative implementing arrangements for the
corresponding programme—estimates, the procedures for awarding EDP contracts and grants,
the rules of the practical guide to management of direct—labour operations and programme—
estimates financed b y the EDF and generally accepted a ccountancy p rinciples. A udits m ay
also be conducted on the systems and procedures introduced, where necessary.

An Audit provision is foreseen in the budget of this Financing Agreement. According to
Article 23 of the 9th EDP Financial Regulation, the Chief Authorising Ofﬁcer can use this
provision to organise an independent audit.

Audit and evaluation contracts and framework contracts are always concluded by the
Commission acting for and on behalf of the ACP State or States concerned.

An independent auditor selected by the NAG shall undertake external audits on. an annual
basis. There shall be an evaluation at the end of the ﬁrst phase (which will act as the trigger for
the second phase) and an end of programme review conducted by external. consultants selected
by the EU. A provision for audits conducted by an external auditor is included in the budget of
this Financing Agreement.
