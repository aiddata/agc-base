Executive Summary

Since the 1998 population and housing census. Malawi has undergone population redistriliruti on
and changes in settlement patterns in most of the areas due to migration induced by uneven
economic development in the districts and urban areas. The changes in ptirpulatitm size and
distribution have affected the size of some 1998 census enumeration. 

As a primary source of data, the 2008 Census shall provide to the country an. important part ofthe
foundation for good governance, decentralization and development. The data collected and the
population—based information shall be crucial for national. district and sectoral policies and ‘1le us,
for development frameworks, such as Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MG-DES)
CCA/UNDAF and other sectoral strategies, as well as for tracking progre towards the MDG
goals and lCPD.

The Census shall play a key role in localizing the MDGs, as a unique source to close the data and
information gaps at the lower levels for the purpose of good governance and effective
decentralization. The data broken down to the local level are indispensable for an understanding
of local solutions, critical planning, and a tool for dialogue about local development priorities.

The analysis of the Census data with additional information from national household surveys can
also be used to develop poverty maps for Malawi.

Several issues underlie the conduct of the forthcoming census. The census shall; update the
information collected during the 1998 Census which is now obsolete. it will enrich the stock of
available socio—demographic data in the country, reinforce the basis of the decentralization.
process, contribute to reinforcing the technical capacity of the N 80 in data collection, processing,

analysis, dissemination and in the use of the census results and products.

The 2008 Census is planned strategically to deliver the expected results and products within. less
than two years (18 months) to meet statistical information requirements for the planning,
monitoring and evaluation of the economic and social development at the national and local
levels. The Census data shall make it possible to measure the impact of lE-llV and AIDS on the
population structure of Malawi. The data on paternal and maternal orphan hood of children and
general mortality shall provide indicators of the effect of HIV and AIDS on families. The Census
data and cartographic maps shall also be indispensable for supporting the organization of the
forthcoming general elections, scheduled to take place in 2009.

The census is a vast operation that requires an accurate and detailed plan in terms of technical,
ﬁnancial and human resources, and a comprehensive training of ﬁeld personnel. It shall be
preceded by sensitization of the population and authorities. An important effort shall be made to

ensure that the data and information are accessible to all users in the public and private sectors.

The Malawian population is the primary beneficiary of the census project. The greatest. risk of a
census operation is the inability to obtain adequate funding; from the gmrernrnent, cooperating
partners and donor organizations, for all census activities. The cartographic work and the primary
enumeration absorb the greatest part of the total cost of the Census, and which are at the same

time crucial to its success.

 

Summary Budget

The cost of the 1998 Census was about l.2.5milli.on US dollars for a population of 9.9 million
ouncl 13.6 million

inhabitants. According to the projections, the 2008 Census shall count ar
people. The estimated budget for the 2008 Malawi Census is about US$31 0.2 million. A oeording
to the data available the average cost of the 2000 Round of Censuses in Southern Africa was
about US$1.74 per capita; however the estimated cost for Malawi is US$1.17 per et—p‘ita. The
estimated budget for the Malawi 2008 Population and l-"zlousing Census is actually at: about the
minimum level for providing accurate and timely data and information on the current popt’tlaticm
‘ for the smallest geographic levels. A summarized budget for 2008 Census is as below
