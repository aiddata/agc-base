Programme Beneﬁciaries

The project will target 2002 households from the selected villages. A recent study by Dr Peter
Ngoma, on Food Securin’ Needs Assessment In The Lower Shire Valley district of Nsanje And
Cnikhwawa, August 2010, found out that there were an average of 6.3 members in each household in
Lower Shire Valley as compared to 4.4 members for Southern Region and 4.6 members for Malawi.
About 48% of the households in Lower Shire Valley were female-headed. About 25% of the
household heads were illiterate and about 97% of them depended on farming as the main occupation
about 3% of the households in Chikhwawa district were landless. It was further noted that about 66%
of the households in Chikhwawa district were classiﬁed as poor and about 34% of the households
were classiﬁed as partially poor.

Indirect Beneﬁciaries

These will include neighbouring communities around the targeted areas who will be beneﬁt from
transference of knowledge through attending Field demonstrations mounted by the project but also
those who will beneﬁt by buying various products from those directly involved in the project. Indirect
beneﬁciaries will also include the rest of family members plus members of extended families who
will be beneﬁt through sharing of the various materials coming out the project. Speciﬁc information
regarding the exact number of community members, stakeholders and organizations representing the
indirect beneﬁciaries will be ﬁnalized after EAM conduct the baseline survey.

Management Structure

The director of the EAM Development Commission, Mr Amos Kalawe, the Operations Manager, Mr
Bryer Mlowoka, and the Finance and Administration Manager will provide oversight function and
ensure that there is adherence to tenets of the partnership agreements. The DRR Program Cordinator,
James Kalikwembe, will be responsible for the overall project coordination closely working with key
district govemment departments, the district assembly and other NGOs operating in Chikwawa
district. One The Project Ofﬁcer will carry out weekly visits to check usage of inputs and knowledge
gained in various workshops, while the DR Coordinator will carry out monthly visits to the project
area to ensure program delivery standards are met. Every two months the Operations Manager or the
EAM’s Director of the Development will be visiting the project to provide management support and
ensure that activities are being implemented on schedule respecting the promises made to the Donor
and communities at the beginning of the project.

Financial Management

EAM’s ﬁnance department is headed by the Finance and Administration Manager who has a CIMA
qualiﬁcation, and the Program Accountant, who is a qualiﬁed chartered accountant; both of whom are
well versed in grant accounting systems. The organisation uses the SAGE PASTEL ﬁnancial package
to generate its reports and Graham Carr & Co. are the current external auditors. EAM will open a
separate IA -designated bank accounts for the prgoramme both in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Transfers
from IA will be into the Lilongwe account from which quarterly disbursement will be made into the
Blantyre basing on work plans. The Irish Aid Finance Advisor conducted on OCAT for EAM
including a detailed review of the ﬁnancial management practices and the system of ﬁnancial
safeguards currently in place. This assessment found that internal procedures and practices within
EAM meet the standards required by IA (see EAM ﬁle).

Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation:

The programme will promote Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) in the planning and
implementation processes. Basically the project will employ an end user based monitoring system that
ensures the right information is collected at the right time and utilised to make decisions that improve
project quality. In this system the project will involve the local community, development agencies,
donors and other stakeholders in monitoring and evaluation of project activities. Speciﬁcally the Field

Ofﬁcer will be conducting weekly monitoring visits to communities to collect data on progress of
work but also provide on spot advice to beneﬁciaries on project implementation processes.

Irish Aid will also conduct quartely monitoring visits to check the level of implementation and ensure
that activties are taking place accoding to the programme proposal. As this is the ﬁrst grant provided
by Irish Aid directly to EAM the MoU will indicate that quarterly ﬁnancial and narrative reports will
be required. Irish Aid will provide EAM with the templates required for these reports and organise a
brieﬁng for EAM staff on the expectations of IA and information required.

Analysis:

The proposal presents a holistic approach to strengthening household resilience through
community based DRR activties.

The range of activties include have been well thought out and should work together to ensure that
households are better able to cope with shocks including natural disaster.

The use of multiple-layers in the design of the programme should also help in terms of providing
safetynets in that if some activities were to fail then others would likely continue and provide at
least some support to participating families.

The proposed activities are very consistent with Pillar two and aspects of Pillar One of the Malawi
CSP and also reﬂect some of the recommendations of the Irish HTF.

IA policy priority issues have been taken into account the proposal.

The inclusion of the baseline and related activties on learning should not only help to improve the
quality of monitoring and evaluation but should also support the quality documentation of
activities for learning and sharing.

While the proposal is focussed speciﬁcally on EAM as the implementing agences it is important
to note that EAM are involved in the wider co-ordination structures and should therefore be in a
postion for inﬂuence policy and the design of wider programme.

If EAM is able to establish positive relationships with GoM, UN agenceis and other NGOs then
they could play an important roll in institutionalising new and more effective appproaces to DRR.

Previous engagement with EAM through the UNDP managed DRR maintreaming programme has
been positive and both the UN TA and independent evaluator of the DR maintreaming gave
positive reviews of the technical capacity of EAM and how they work with Government and local
communities.

and will ensure that the learning from existing programmes feeds into the ﬁnal design of the joint
programme.

0 Irish Aid will also support EAM to apply for future funding via the joint resilience programe and
support them to dovetail their approaches to ﬁt within the focus of this programme as it develops.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This proposal is an expression of Evangelical Association of Malawi’s (EAM) intent to secure
funding from Irish Aid Malawi for the implementation of a Community Based Disaster Risk
Management Project (CBDRM) for targeted vulnerable communities living in ﬂood and drought
prone areas of Chikhwawa district in the southern region of Malawi. The purpose of the intended
project will be the participatory development and implementation of disaster risk management
strategies to ensure sustainable environmental community based disaster resilience in the targeted
areas. The intended project will also endeavor to enhance the institutionalization of disaster risk
reduction  at community and district level through advocacy initiatives and comparative action
research to encourage scale-up processes by relevant stakeholders, and inform policy review
proceSSes at district and national level.

The proposed project is premised on the understanding that local communities are the essential
actors in the efforts to make the Hyogo Framework for Action (I-IFA)‘ a practical tool for saving
lives and livelihoods. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) is a systematic and strategic approach
to reduction of vulnerability and risk to disastersewhich the Malawi endorsed in 20053

:The project outputs will therefore connect to the ﬁve priority areas of the HFA and indicative‘
activities will be developed to help reduce disaster risks in the targeted communities. The intended
activities will be planned and implemented with the active participation of communities. It is a fact
that unless poor people living in disaster prone areas are mobilized, trained and adequately supported,
global opinions on DRR such as the HFA (2005—2015) will continue to be good ideas while people
living in poverty continue to reel under the impact of natural disasters, which are exacerbated by
effects of climate change. The management of the CBDRM project will build on the capacity of
EAM’s experience in DR and Climate Change Adaptation initiatives to collaborate with relevant
district council structures, local stakeholders and targeted communities in the implementation,
monitoring and evaluation of the intended strategies.

The CBDRlVl project will also help build the capacity of the district council to promote communal
action on global opinion on DRR, with a focus on the HFA, and feed into the national progress on
HFA implementation. The Government of Malawi, through the Department of Disaster
Management Affairs (DoDMA) submits annual reports to the ISDR on HFA progress. However, if
projects by different stakeholders are not developed through the HFA spectacles, it is always difficult
to analyze progress and link it to the priority areas. The approach to link the project result areas to
the HFA will aid the smooth follow up of DR activities at district level. Creation of positive
impacts in reducing people’s mlnerability in flood and drought prone areas would significantly
contribute to the realisation Malawi Growth Development Strategy which identiﬁed disasters as one
of the key hindering factors to Malawi’s growth and poverty reduction effort in major policy
documents.

1.0 Background and Justiﬁcation

The purpose of this proposal is to share with Irish Aid the intent and criteria to develop and
implement a Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) project in selected vulnerable
communities of Chikhwawa district. The CBDRM project will endeavor to build community based
and environmentally sustainable DRR initiatives through advocacy, capacity building, livelihood
diversification, community—based disaster preparedness and i‘nitigadon and climate change adaptation
initiatives to ensure -resilience of vulnerable communities and households living in disaster prone
areas. This project is aligned to the Malawi DRR framework, 2010—2015 that prioritizes a set of
challenges that should be addressed in the next ﬁve years and provides strategic directions to reduce
vulnerabilities and risk to hazard This aligns Government’s DRR priorities with other national
policies as well as international commitments

1.1 Background

Malawi, a small, low income, landlocked country in southern Africa, experiences a number of weather
induced disasters such as seasonal droughts, floods, acute dry spells, storms and earthquakes. In
200] / 2002 the country suffered terrible famines as localized ﬂoods reduced maize production by
one—third. Between 500 and 1,000 people in the central and southern part of the country died during
the disaster or in the aftermath. Up to 20,000 people are estimated to have died as an indirect result
of associated malnutrition and disease". The situation is exacerbated by effects of climate change,
resulting in increased frequency and intensity of weather related disasters. The impacts of such
disasters on the communities are many and diverse. In most cases communities are negatively
impacted by these disasters which lead to loss of human lives, crop ﬁelds, livestock, household assets
and biodiversity.

Chikhwawa district, where the CBDRM project will be implemented, is one of the districts in Malawi
that experiences ﬂoods and drought (deﬁned as acute dry spells) almost yearly. In the months of
December 2009 and January 20102009 Chikhwawa was one of the five districts in the Southern
Region that was severely affected by acute dry spells for the second farming season running. These
districts included Nsanje, Chikhwawa, Thyolo, Balaka and Zomba in which decline in crop
production ranged from 80% to 100% (Chikhwawa and Nsanje) thereby putting over 660,000
people at risk of not meeting their food needs for the year, according to the Malawi Vulnerability
Assessment Committee (MVAC) Report of June, 2010.

There are several inter—related factors, such as underlying causes, dynamic pressures and unsafe
conditions which contribute to the vulnerability of poor communities due to the effects of ﬂoods and
drought disasters. It is therefore imperative for communities to understand the degree of their
vulnerability and take an active role to develop ideal measures to address disaster related issues.

The CBDRM project will be implemented in T/A Lundu and Sub T/A Ndakwera, targeting 4 Group
Village Headpersons and 22 villages. The project will engage both government, especially
Chilthwawa district council, and the targeted communities, in a participatory manner, to analyze their
vulnerability and consider a range of measures to reduce the risks and move towards disaster
resilience. Currently EAM is implementing DRR interventions with support from Christian Aid
targeting T/A Chapananga, Sub T/A N dakwera, T/A Lundu, T/A N gowe, T/A Masache, and T/A
Maseya under the DIPECHO funding. This CBDRM project will target part of T/A Lundu and Sub
T/A Ndakwera and care has been taken to avoid overlaps in targeted communities covered by the
two separate projects (see the map appended below).

1.2 Rationale

Over the past two decades the magnitude and frequency of disaster occurrences has called for a huge
increase in resources needed for humanitarian assistance. Disasters play an important role in
constructing poverty of rural and urban households and can explain larger geographical distribution
of poverty in the country They erode the ability of national economy to invest in key social sectors
which are important to reducing poverty. For example, the southern region experiences high
concentration of poor people and at the same time experience most severe form of disasters, such as
ﬂooding and drought. Major disasters have had substantial budgetary impacts, resulting in additional
unplanned expenditure, Widening ﬁscal deficits and increased domestic borrowing and thus in rising
domestic interest rates and additional inﬂations.

Although huge resources have gone into disaster humanitarian operations, vulnerable communities
have not been helped to escape the cycle of disaster. In most cases, protracted and badly planned for
humanitarian operations have ‘deﬁned the ﬁeld as highly reactive and relief—oriented, and extremely
dependent on outside initiative and ﬁnancial support’“. It is a fact that poor and vulnerable

Malawi case study. Draft, February 2008,
6A1isa Holloway, Disaster Risk Reduction in Southern Africa: Hal rhetoric-COM reality, (Article in African Security Review Vol
12 No.1, 2003)

communities that have for a long time beneﬁted from prolonged humanitarian operations have
developed a dependence—syndrome spirit which has eroded their sense of worthiness and dignity and
the enthusiasm to harness their local resources to reduce their vulnerability.

Since the development of the HFA on Disaster Reduction (2005-2015), some governments in other
continents are making progress in mainstreaming DRR into policies and strategies for disaster
response, mitigation and preparedness initiatives, while most African governments lag behind. As a
result, a community based application of ideal measures to reduce risk of disasters and integration of
DR into development plans continue to pose a challenge.

In 2006 the Malawi government Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA) embarked
on country—wide DRR awareness and capacity building workshops, which targeted local government
(district) officials and NGOs involved in disaster management related activities. The main objective
was to challenge participants to integrate risk reduction initiatives in their development programs.
Not many stakeholders involved in DRM have used the HFA concept to guide them in the
development of community based risk reduction projects. As a result, tracking progress of HFA
implementation at local, district and national level is a challenge, clue to the lack of understanding of
the HFA benchmarks. The proposed CBDRM project in Chikhwawa will be designed along the
HFA priority areas to ensure good progress tracking of DR work and general understanding of
international strategies on DRR.

Chikhwawa district has an agro-based economy. Agriculture is the single means of livelihood with
over 80% of the population engaged in subsistence farming with an average land holding size of
cultivated land of about 0.8 hectares per farming family7. The land holding size is slightly less than the
national land holding size which stands at 1.0ha of land. In the Southern region of Malawi the land
pressure is particularly high where per capita average landholding sizes are less than 0.2 ha.

—However, the agriculture sector, which provides livelihoods for many subsistence—farming
households, is often threatened by climatic shocks exposing many people to food shortages. In
severe situations people are forced to cut back on meals, withdraw children from school, sell
household goods and, in some cases, engage in irreversible coping strategies like charcoal business
and sex work to find money and food. The need to understand Vulnerability factors and develop
measures to reduce them cannot be overemphasized.

\X’hile Chikhwawa district has over the past decade beneﬁted from humanitarian and relief
operations implemented by government and local and international organizations, little has been
done to build community resilience to disasters. EAM through this CBDRM project endeavours to
make a difference because building community resilience to disasters is its area of speciality, drawing
from its ten years experiences of facilitating community based DRR initiatives in Chikhwawa district.
EAM has practically embraced humanitarian accountability partnership principles in its approaches
which have translated into positive impacts in communities. EAM DRR programming is informed
by a culture of learning from its work and from experiences of others and as such works very closely
with the Church structures, relevant government departments and NGOs in order to effectively
contribute to the reduction of poverty in Malawi. The CBDRM project will therefore deliberately
focus on capacity building and risk reduction experiences, working with communities in DR
activities, and challenge targeted communities to embrace proactive approaches to disaster
management to ensure long term solutions to perennial disaster problems.

supporting DRR work in the communities. Faith leaders and CBOs interface with the
community members on weekly basis and as such they are in a better position to inﬂuence
change in mindset from relying on hand outs to hands up approaches. These groups are already
working with communities on issues of HIV and AIDS, Environment rehabilitation and

regional, district, area and village level such as the Civil Protection Committees (CPCs). These
structures are responsible for risk reduction work such as risk assessment, disaster damage
assessment and development and implementation of risk management plans. The CBDRM
project will focus on building the capacity of 4 villages through training programs to ensure that
they are able to carry out their duties efficiently. 4 well trained CPCs will be able to continue
with review assessments beyond the project’s lifespan.

Output 2.3.3

Awareness for community based and people—centred preparatory and response actions for safer

A well alerted and prepared community is one of the pre-requisites for effective community
based disaster risk management initiatives. The project will develop appropriate messages with
support from the print and electronic media houses for sharing with the general public on the
importance of having knowledge on Community based Early warning systems in Disaster
management and response. The project plans to procure and print 300 T—Shirts utilising
previous designs developed under Dipecho Action 1 to roll out early warning messages to one
old and three new impact areas. Procurement documents will distinguish items bought under
IA budget. The project will link up with Radio stations, Malawi Broadcasting Television and
Daily Newspapers, Nation and Daily Times for technical guidance, minimal costs to cover
refreshments, transport refunds and talent fees will be paid to these pressmen.

Strategic alliances with relevant institutions, like the education sector, will be pursued to ensure
effective dissemination strategies. The project will promote the implementation of Community
Awareness and Education Strategies (CABS) in five schools under Nchalo zone and five schools
under Mbewe Zone on practical disaster preparedness and risk reduction measures, including
the use of participatory assessment in all the 22 villages. The project The project will produce at
least 1000 copies of posters for distribution to various stakeholders and for DRR campaign
meetings. Ten DRR clubs will be formed in all the ten primary schools in the area trusting that
there will be a multiplier effect where information from the Clubs will be passed onto other
children and the rest communities where these children come from.

Four small scale irrigation sites at Nyamphota, Tizola, Mpasu and Makhokwe will be established
beneﬁting at least 600 households. Each site will accommodate 150 famers who will be supplied with
7 treadle pumps. This implies that a total of 28 pumps will be procured and distributed to the whole
group, Households will be expected to share usage of Treadle pumps which is the normal practice in
the old community which had beneﬁted from the previous DRR mainsueaming project

among 600 households through water harvesting and small—scale irrigation. This will be for winter
cropping in order to supplement on low rain—fed crop harvest which tends to be affected by drought
or ﬂooding. This is not a duplication of FISP rather a complementary program. As a matter of fact
the Winter FlSP is not a guaranteed government program it depends on the good will of
government, even when it is provide it targets only a very small population leaving out many more
deserving households without any assistance. It is these people who are left out that the CBDRM
would like to target

4.3 lupuliﬂir mie-ﬁdﬁmz'ng 6‘" winter (opp (flirting/1t tolerant Hopi")

The project will procure 600kgs of OPV maize varieties which can be recycled for at least three years;
this tends to be a cost saving measure as farmers need not spend money on buying seeds every year.
Farmers will also benefit from 800 kgs of Sorghum and Millet which are drought tolerant crops and
normally do well even with little rainfall. The project will not provide fertilizer during this summer
period because farmers have access to FISP during this time.

livelihood. One hundred goats will be

procured and distributed to 10 villages. Each village will
receive 10 goats going to 5 household each receiving two goats, one female and one male. The

selection process will be based on an assessment of villages and households that are most vulnerable
to floods. Distribution of goats will be done after households have received an appropriate training
in goat rearing. In lower Shire goats adapt very well to hot conditions and they are a reliable source
of income mainly in periods of drought when food is scarce. Households can easily sell a goat and
realise cash which they can use to buy food and feed their families. Households will be expected to
share their off~springs with their neighbours and process will continue on and on. The pass on

scheme is framed on the premise that there is an inbuilt multiplier effect which ensures a small
investment can benefit many more in the long run.

The program will also form five and strengthen four village savings and loan groups as one form of
diversifying into non—agricultural livelihoods. The facility is expected at least 200 people within a
period of one year EAlVI staff has capacity in Micro-Finance and is already involved in facilitation of
Village Savings Loans in neighbouring communities where the activity has registered success. This
activity is part of the EAM’S roll up plan of giving priority to non-agricultural livelihoods

The project plans to raise at least 80,000 tree seedlings to address issues of natural resource and
environmental rehabilitation to mitigate the impact of climate change. Technical guidance will be
sought from the Department of Forestry at District level so that right tree species which can bring
desired results are planted and promoted. Communities will be trained in good tree seedling
management to prevent being trampled upon by livestock and bush fires. The previous DRR
mainstreaming project had some measure of success which was hampered by the general poor rainfall

in the area. This year promises to be a lanina year and more wet conditions are expected to guarantee
high tree seedling survival rate.

4.8 Bore/7019 rebabi/z'tatz'on

The project plans to rehabilitate 2 boreholes to help promote water and sanitation efforts in selected
in Suweni and Mafale villages. The rehabilitation work will take into account risk reduction aspects

Cross Cutting Issues

In recognition of differentiated vulnerabilities of groups like children, women, the elderly, people
with disabilities and those affected by HIV and AIDS, EAM will make sure VCPCs are trained to
prioritise care and safety of these special interests groups by ensuring that they are targeted with
information and education on disaster management as quickly as possible. EAM will also ensure
equal participation of community people in the planning and implementation of project activities and
benefits thereof regardless of gender, status, race and religious inclinations.

Humanitarian operations and mitigation work will involve critical assessment of potential
environmental impact to avoid causing harm to the already fragile environment. EAM will employ
DRR principles embodied in the characteristics of resilient communities in governance, knowledge
and education and disaster preparedness and response. EAM staff will also endeavour to adhere to
Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) principles and Sphere standards in execution of
project plans, this will ensure that all the cross cutting issues are considered in project implementation

processes.
3.0 Target group and beneﬁciaries
3.1 Direct Beneﬁciaries

The project will target 2002 households from the selected Villages. A recent study by Dr Peter
Ngoma, on Food Setting)! Need: AIIHIWZMZ In The Lower Sbire Val/e! diitritt of Nun/jg And Chikhwawa,
Augmf 2070, found out that there were an average of 6.3 members in each household in Lower Shire
Valley as compared to 44 members for Southern Region and 4.6 members for Malawi. About 48%
of the households in Lower Shire Valley were female—headed. About 25% of the household heads
were illiterate and about 97% of them depended 0n farming as the main occupation about 3% of the
households in Chikhwawa district were landless. It was further noted that about 66% of the
households in Chikhwawa district were classified as poor and about 34% of the households were
classified as partially poor.

It is these households who will participate in different project activities to achieve the intended result
areas. These households will be identiﬁed in a participatory manner using existing CPCs, focusing on
elderly, female and child headed households. Activities will include small-scale irrigation, crop
diversiﬁcation, village savings and loan groups, livestock pass-on schemes, and rehabilitation of river
banks through reforestation works. Other community structures such as committees for established
small—scale irrigation clubs, village savings and loan groups and participating households will also
benefit from the capacity building workshops. Other community structures to benefit from capacity
building initiatives will include the education sector (schools), faith institutions and CBOS.

3.2 Indirect Beneﬁciaries

This will include members of the society that will not be directly receiving inputs offered by me
project. These will include neighbouiing communities around the targeted areas who will be benefit
from transference of knowledge through attending Field demonstrations mounted by the project but
also those who will benefit by buying various products from those directly involved in the project.
Indirect beneficiaries will also include the rest of family members plus members of extended
families who will be benefit through sharing of the various materials coming out the project. Specific
information regarding the exact number of community members, stakeholders and organizations
representing the indirect beneficiaries will be finalized after carrying out a baseline survey.

4.0 Management arrangements

EAM is a registered umbrella organization for evangelical churches, Christian organizations, and
individuals incorporated under the Trustee Act of 1962. It has a membership of 104 members, made
up of 53 church denominations and 51 Christian organizations. EAM is a member of CONGOMA,
Africa Evangelical Alliance (AEA), World Evangelical Alliance (WEA), Public Affairs Committee
(PAC), Malawi Interfaith Aids Association (MIAA) and Ecumenical Counseling Center (ECC). It is
also an active member of several civil society networks, such as the Civil Society Network on Climate
Change (CISONECC), the Malawi Economic Justice Network, (MEJN) and the Malawi Equity
Health Network among others.

The organisation has an Executive Board that governs and oversees the work of the organization,
while its subcommittee, the Strategic Management Advisory Committee, provides technical support
to the senior management team to ensure quality performance standards are maintained

The organisation has vast experience in Disaster Risk Management work in different parts of the
country. Over the past 10 years, it has had the opportunity to collaborate with different donor
institutions, including Christian Aid, Irish Aid, UNDP, Tearfund and the Department of Disaster
Management Affairs, in the implementation of various programs in Disaster Risk Management.
EAM staff sits on government taskforces that are developing the National DRR Policy Framework
and Disaster Risk Management Handbook. EAM has established links with Chikhwawa district
council and has a good track record of working in an all inclusive participatory manner to ensure that
views from women and all other community groups are respected.

The director of the EAM Development Commission, Mr Amos Kalawe, the Operations Manager, Mr
Bryer Mlowoka, and the Finance and Administration Manager will provide oversight function and
ensure that there is adherence to tenets of the partnership agreements. The DRR Program
Cordinator, James Kalikwembe, will be answerable for the overall project coordination closely
working with key district government departments, the district assembly and other NGOs operating
in Chikwawa distiict. One Project Officer will be available for actual grassroots facilitation to ensure
that the project objectives are implemented in a timely and efficient manner. The entire team will
work towards achieving excellence in the delivery of project services. The Project Ofﬁcer will carry
out weekly visits to check usage of inputs and knowledge gained in various workshops, while the
DR Coordinator will carry out monthly visits to the project area to ensure program delivery
standards are met. Every two months the Operations Manager or the EAM’s Director of the
Development will be visiting the project to provide management support and ensure that activities
are being implemented on schedule respecting the promises made to the Donor and communities at
the beginning of the project.

5.0 Financial Management

EAM has efficient financial pr0cedures and systems to ensure proper use and accountability of
resources entrusted to it on behalf of the communities. The organisation has adequate financial
controls that regulate accounting and procurement procedures to minimise inherent financial risks.
The organisation’s finance department is headed by the Finance and Administration Manager who
has a CIMA qualification, and the Program Accountant, who is a qualified chartered accountant; both
of whom are well versed in grant accounting systems. The organisation uses the SAGE PASTEL
financial package to generate its reports and Graham Carr & Co. are the current external auditors.
EAM will open a separate IA —designated bank accounts for the CBDRM project both in Lilongwe
and Blantyre. Transfers from IA will be into the Lilongwe account from which quarterly
disbursement will be made into the Blantyre basing on work plans.

This account in Blantyre will be managed by the DR Program Coordinator, with close supervision
from senior management team in Lilongwe and the Southern region EAM committee. The bank
accounts will solely be used for IA funds. Each month financial reports will be submitted to the
secretariat in Lilongwe and a financial monitoring will be undertaken to check adequacy and
authenticity of the report. The sub ofﬁce will have limited access to the bank account as guided by
EAMs financial procedures where approval for any payment in excess of MK250, 000 will have to be
sought from the General Secretary or his designate in Lilongwe. At the community level the Project
Ofﬁcer/ Field Ofﬁcer will generates ﬁnancial requests for project activities to the DRR Coordinator,
who has to clear with Lilongwe ofﬁce if the request is beyond his approval limit.

Once the activity has been done the Project Ofﬁcer will ﬁle an end of activity report with beneﬁciary
list attached as end users. The sub office has a Finance Ofﬁcer who keeps records of all finance
transactions and produces monthly ﬁnancial reports which are checked and reviewed by the Finance
and Administration Manager. This accountability structure ensures credibility to the quality of both
Narrative and Financial reports generated for management and donor consumption.

6.0 Monitoring & Evaluation Arrangements

The CBDRM Project will promote Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation  in the planning
and implementation processes. Basically the project will employ an end user based monitoring system
that ensures the right information is collected at the right time and utilised to make decisions that
improve project quality. In this system the project will involve the local community, development
agencies, donors and other stakeholders in monitoring and evaluation of project activities. Emphasis
will be made on usage of monitoring strategies that can provide management with timely, accurate
and complete information on project effectiveness with regard to inputs being utilized to produce
desired results. The project staff will put in place relevant mechanisms and data collection tools to
ensure proper management of project results during the implementation period and for reference
beyond the life of the project.

The project will put in place an implementing team comprising key community stakeholders, relevant
government extension workers and project staff. The principal responsibilities will include the
supervision of project activities through the monitoring of progress of work and analyzing reports to
inform stakeholders on the status of the project at a particular point in time. Speciﬁcally the Field
Ofﬁcer will be conducting weekly monitoring visits to communities to collect data on progress of
work but also provide on spot advice to beneﬁciaries on project implementation processes.
Community members will be involved in record keeping of who is benefiting from the programs so
that they are able to tell their own story of how the project is impacting their lives.

The DRR coordinator will be available to provide technical advice to the Field Ofﬁcer through
provision of feedback to the reports generated from the Field. He will also endeavour to visit the
project and check for indicators of change of attitudes, awareness, and increase in knowledge in
regard to community resilience to disasters. Members of senior management will on quarterly basis
undertake monitoring visits; Irish Aid will be invited to participate in these as well, to appreciate the
impact of the project in people’s lives.

7.0 Learning

The project will also encourage the spirit of ‘learning from a project and evolving’ among the various
stakeholders in Chikhwawa and beyond. In order to ensure intentional learning takes place, strategic
sharing and learning opportunities will be planned to cater for community based learning and

14

speciﬁcally learning for District government personnel and other stakeholders. At community level
field days will be planned where communities will be able to showcase beneﬁts from the community
based disaster risk interventions to the general public for replication purposes especially in the
neighbouring communities. At district level the project will organise project quarterly review
workshops where period reports depicting successes, challenges and lessons learnt will be shared with
key stakeholders. Documentation of best practices will be Written for sharing at national workshops
with a wider network of other players in Disaster Risk reduction arena.
