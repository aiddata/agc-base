EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

Project Background

The proposed Support to Secondary Education (Education V) Project has its basis in the
government’s Policy Investment Framework (PIF) for the development of the education
sector, and in the recently developed Education Sector Plan (ESP). The PIF defines the
country’s educational policies and strategies and outlines priorities for the period 2002-2012.
The ESP translates these priorities and strategies into an implementation plan for the period
2005 - 2015. The project will support these policies and strategies by contributing to specific
components of the ESP aimed at the improvement of the quality of secondary education
provided, especially at the community day secondary schools, which are the principal
providers of secondary education to disadvantaged rural communities and has been accorded
a central position in the government’s strategy for poverty reduction.

The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) for 2006—2011 delineates the
government’s poverty reduction strategy. And, the 2005-09 CSP for Malawi revolves around
interventions in two pillars of the MGDS: Pillar I — Expanding Rural Infrastructure and Pillar
II — Developing Human Capital and Institutional Capacity. The project will support the
second pillar.

Sector Goal and Project Objectives

 

The overall sector goal is to achieve universal quality primary education and increased access
and improved quality with gender parity in post—primary education. The objective of the
project is to contribute to improved quality and equity of secondary education, especially at
the Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs) in the country.

Brief Description of the Project Outputs

 

In order to achieve this objective, the project will focus attention on (i) infrastructure
development, (ii) educational materials provision, and (iii) capacity building and policy
development for secondary education. The project will support the upgrading of infrastructure
at 30 CDSSs, through the provision of 120 new classrooms, 30 science teaching areas, 30
libraries, 30 administrative blocks, 60 teachers’ houses, latrines and boreholes. Science
teaching materials and library books for these 30 schools and an initial stock of textbooks for
60,000 CDSS students will be provided. Qualifications of 400 under—qualified CDSS math
and science teachers will be upgraded, 300 CDSS head teachers will receive management
training and 54 school inspectors will receive training in school inspection and supervision.
Consultancy services for the development of ICT policy for secondary education and for
review of post primary education to assist in reforming the sub—sector will be supported.
Technical support and operating cost for project management will be provided.

Project Cost

The total cost of the project is estimated at UA 16.66 million, of which UA 11.77 million
(70.6%) will be in foreign currency and UA 4.89 million (29.4%) will be in local currency.

(ix)

Source of Finance

ADF and the Government of Malawi will jointly finance the project. ADF grant (UA 15
million) will be utilized to finance professional services, civil works, furniture, equipment and
supplies, training, technical assistance, and operating costs. The total ADF contribution
representing 90% of total costs will be utilized to cover 100% of foreign exchange costs and
66.0% of local costs, which represents 19.4% of total cost of the project. The Government of
Malawi’s contribution of UA 1.66 million, representing 10% of the project costs, will be used
to cover part of the civil works.

Project Implementation

The project will be implemented over a period of 5 years. The executing agency of the
project will be the Ministry of Education. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), currently
managing the on-going ADF Education IV Project, under the direction of the Director of
Planning of the Ministry of Education, and with support from the Ministry of Education’s
departments of teacher education, planning, inspectorate and secondary education, will be
responsible for the day to day management of project activities.

Conclusions and Recommendations

 

The proposed project responds to Malawi’s need to improve the quality and equity of
education. It will contribute to the Government’s effort to improve secondary education,
especially at Community Day Secondary Schools. The project will provide resources for
infrastructure development, education materials provision and capacity building and policy
development for secondary education, reinforcing the objectives of the on-going ADF
Education IV Project (Support to Community Day Secondary Schools Project) and
complementing assistance provided by other development partners to the sector.

It is recommended that an ADF grant not exceeding UA 15.00 million be extended to the
Government of Malawi for the purpose of implementing the project as described in this
report, subject to conditions specified in the Protocol of Agreement for the grant.

1. ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE PROJECT

1.1 Malawi is one of the poorest countries in Africa. Per capita income stood at US$ 170
in 2004 compared to the continent’s average of US$ 800. It is estimated that about 65% of
the population live below the poverty line. Poverty is also more prevalent in rural areas where
66% of the population live below the poverty line than in urban areas where the proportion of
the poor stands at 55%. The govemment’s overall objective is the reduction of poverty. And,
as stipulated in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) for 2006-2011, which
is the successor strategy of the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP), the
provision of quality education is central to the reduction of poverty. The MGDS highlights the
critical role education could play in alleviating poverty and in developing the human capital
that could contribute to the country’s socio—economic development.

1.2 The proposed project has its basis in the government’s Policy and Investment
Framework (PIF) for the development of the education sector. The PIF is the education
sector’s response to the government policy of poverty reduction. The PIF provides direction
in the development of education and is based on a comprehensive analysis of the education
sector in Malawi. It defines the country’s educational policies and strategies and outlines
priorities for the period 2002-2012. The PIF was developed through an extensive participation
of all stakeholders and a national Education Sector Plan (ESP) has been developed to translate
the strategies in the PIF into an implementation plan for 2005 - 2015. The proposed project is
planned to fit into this investment framework, by supporting the policies and strategies
expressed in the PIF and the activities contained in the ESP.

1.3 In February 2004, the Ministry of Education requested a new ADF education project.
Consequently, in September 2004, the Bank undertook an identification mission to explore
priority areas for support in the education sector under a fifth ADF education project. The
identification mission met government officials and representatives of development partners
active in the education sector and agreed that future ADF support will be within the context of
the PIF and will support priorities set in the education sector plan. Within the sector plan, it
was also agreed that future ADF support to the sector should primarily focus on the secondary
education sub—sector, with the aim of contributing to efforts to improve the quality of
secondary education. The introduction of free primary education in 1994 resulted in huge
enrollments at the primary level, and this subsequently created increased demand for the
provision of secondary education. The secondary sub—sector expanded, largely as a result of
the establishment of Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs). But the quality of
secondary education provided remains very poor, adversely impacting on the skill levels of
the working population. The quality of secondary education is especially low at the CDSSs,
which are the principal providers of secondary education to disadvantaged rural communities
and are the poorest resourced public secondary schools. It was therefore agreed that the
project addresses quality and equity issues in secondary education. The project was prepared
by a Bank mission that visited Malawi in June 2005. And, following government formal
request during the dialogue mission for the 2005—09 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) in August
2005 for the inclusion of the project in the ADF assistance for the country and the approval of
the CSP in December 2005, the project was appraised in February 2006.

1.4 The project will assist government efforts to improve the quality of secondary
education provided, especially at the CDSSs in Malawi. This is consistent with the country’s
strategies for reducing poverty as outlined in the MGDS. In recognition of the impact of
access to quality education on poverty reduction, improvement of the quality of education,

particularly in rural areas, has been accorded a central position in the MGDS. The project is
also in line with the Bank’s assistance strategy for Malawi, which is to assist the country in its
efforts to alleviate poverty through the promotion of rural development, especially by
addressing the problem of food insecurity, investing in human capital and institutional
capacity building as outlined in the results—based 2005—09 CSP. The project will support the
second pillar of the CSP, namely developing human capital and institutional capacity
building. In addition, the project is consistent with the Bank’s education sector policy and
complements the assistance provided by other development partners, as well as building on
the achievements of the previous four (three completed and one on—going) ADF education
projects.

2. THE EDUCATION SECTOR

2.1 The Structure of Education System

 

2.1.1 The formal education system is organized around eight years of primary education,
four of secondary and four of university. Annex II shows the structure of Malawi’s education
system. There are currently 5,159 primary schools enrolling about 3.2 million pupils. During
the last year of primary education, pupils register for the Primary School Leaving Certificate
Examination (PSLCE), which is used for selection into secondary level education. Pre-school
education (for about 135,000 children) is provided by 3,200 early childhood centers run by
communities and private groups.

2.1.2 It is estimated that there are 978 secondary schools in Malawi, which have an
estimated student population of 183,854. There are two national selection secondary school
examinations; the Junior Certificate Examination (JCE) done after two years of secondary
school education and the Malawi School Certificate Examination (MSCE) which is taken by
students who have completed four years of secondary education.

2.1.3 Tertiary education is provided at two levels: teacher training colleges and university.
Primary and secondary teacher training colleges and vocational and technical institutions cater
to those students who cannot gain admission to university. There are approximately 2,700
students enrolled in 6 national primary teacher—training colleges. An additional 1,300 are
enrolled at the Domasi College of Education, which trains secondary school teachers. The
country’s technical and vocational education institutions which are now under the
management of the Ministry of Labor and Manpower Development enroll a further 1,500
students. At the university level, the University of Malawi and Mzuzu University provide
university education to about 5,500 students.

2.2 Institutional Framework of the Sector

2.2.1 Educational services are provided by three government agencies, namely; the Ministry
of Education (MoE) which is primarily responsible for primary, secondary and teacher training;
the Ministry of Labor for technical and vocational training; the Ministry of Gender for preschool
education. Coordination between the three ministries is very weak, adversely affecting the
efficient delivery of educational resources. The universities are autonomous agencies with
government support and there are private institutions that offer education principally at the
secondary level. The organizational structure of the MoE is shown in Annex III.

2.2.2 The management, planning, coordination and financing of the national system of
public schools are shared by the national Ministry of Education, the regions and districts. But the
MoE is embarking on a policy of decentralizing the delivery of educational services. The
guidelines for decentralization, the action plans and activities that would be devolved to the
districts are being worked out. There are six educational regions, which are further sub-
divided into 33 educational districts. A district education office administers a number of
school zones that are the lowest administrative authorities. An average zone covers 10 to 15
schools. The establishment of primary and secondary schools, which used to be dominated by
the public sector, has recently been liberalized with the private sector and communities making
significant contribution to the expansion of the education system. Despite the govemment’s
liberalization policy, primary and secondary education still remains the government and
communities' area of operation with local governments, regional, district and school committees
playing major roles in providing resources and other contributions for school functioning.

2.3 Status of the Education Sector

 

Access Issues

2.3.1 Malawi has experienced some remarkable expansion of its national education system
during the last decade. At the basic education level, the introduction of free primary education
in 1994 resulted in a rise of the primary school population from approximately 1.4 million in
1990 to about 2.8 million in 1995 and to a high of 3.2 million in 2005. Most primary school
age children are attending school and the net enrollment ratio (NER) is about 90%. Progress
has also been significant at the secondary school sub sector. In 2005, approximately 183,854
students (22% in private schools) were enrolled in secondary education compared to
approximately 31,500 in 1990 and just over 48,000 in 1995. Likewise, the tertiary sub—sector
is now opening up. As of 2004, approximately 5,500 students were enrolled in the country’s
universities, up from slightly over 3,000 in 1990 and about 3,500 in 1995. Almost 4,000
students are enrolled in primary and secondary teacher training institutions.

2.3.2 Access however remains an area of concern at the secondary and tertiary levels
where gross enrollment ratios (GER) are approximately 17% and 0.6% respectively. This
represents some of the lowest enrolment ratios in Africa. Moreover, the gains of increased
primary school access have been somewhat diminished by the fact that a significant number
of those enrolled in primary education repeat or drop out of the system. It is estimated that out
of every 100 children entering primary school, only 46 complete standard 8 and overall
repetition at the primary level is 25%, making the attainment of the Millennium Development
Goal (MDG) of universal primary completion difficult. At the secondary level, the average
dropout rate is 12% every year. The drop out rate amongst girls is 16% and amongst boys it is
10%, indicating a significantly higher number of girls drop out at secondary level,
undermining the MDG of eliminating gender disparity in secondary education. Ministry of
Education school—surveys report that the main reason for dropping out of school for both boys
and girls is lack of interest, largely attributed to the poor learning conditions at schools. But
family responsibilities, early marriage, and pregnancy are additional reasons for the higher
proportion of girls dropping out of school compared to boys. Some policies instituted by the
government to improve retention of girls in the schools include allowing girls to resume
school after pregnancies and bursary programs that favor girls.

Equity issues

2.3.3 A second major problem confronting the country’s education system is unequal
access. Although a number of measures have been taken to improve girls’ and women’s
participation in Malawi’s educational institutions and equal numbers of girls and boys start
school, gender parity at the upper levels of the education system has yet to be achieved. Girls
are particularly under—represented at the secondary and tertiary education levels. Currently,
about 43% of the secondary school population are girls and women constitute less than 30%
of tertiary education enrollment. Malawian girls are also relatively under—represented in
vocational training institutions and are more prone to repetition and dropout. Females also
form the majority of the country’s illiterates. In addition, there are inequalities of access
across socio—economic groups and regions as well as between rural and urban areas.
Government efforts to increase access of girls to secondary education include admission
polices that give preferences to girls, but hostel capacities at boarding schools is a limiting
factor. At the day secondary schools 50% of school spaces are reserved for girls, but at
government boarding schools, where there are more hostels for boys than for girls, the
number of girls admitted is less than 50%. In 2004, 45% of the students admitted to the first
year of secondary education (Form 1) were girls even though girls made up only 39% of the
students passing the PSLC exam taken at the end of the primary cycle, thus indicating the
positive impact of the policy on girls’ education.

Quality Issues

2.3.4 A third major issue is the relatively poor quality of education offered by the
country’s educational institutions as evidenced by the results of national selection
examinations. Many primary school children are taught in overcrowded classes by unqualified
teachers and have to share very limited teaching/learning resources. Although at present only
about 15% of primary school teachers are classified as untrained and do not possess relevant
professional and academic qualifications, the average pupil to teacher ratio in primary school
is 71:1 and average number of pupils in a primary school classroom is about 106. The poor
state of the available learning/teaching conditions also applies to secondary schools and
especially at the Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs). About 28% of secondary
school teachers are classified as qualified for the level they teach. The situation is worse at the
CDSSs, where only 14% of the teachers are qualified; instructional materials are severely
lacking and half of the infrastructure is not suitable for teaching and learning. At the
secondary level the pupil teacher ratio is 20:1, but the pupil to qualified teacher ratio is 73:1.
This high pupil to qualified teachers ratio is principally due to the presence of a large number
of under qualified teachers at CDSSs. About 86% of CD88 teachers are unqualified to teach
at the secondary level compared to 26% at other public secondary schools. Available facilities
in tertiary educational institutions are also outdated and over—stretched beyond their
capacities.

2.3.5 Despite these shortcomings in quality, progress has been made in some areas. For
example a new curriculum has been developed for the primary level and policies for
inspection and textbook provision are nearing completion. Also, strategies for primary teacher
education have been mapped out and funding for primary education has been decentralized.
The new primary curriculum, called Primary Curriculum Assessment and Review (PCAR),
will be introduced in 2007, first for grade 1 and later on rolled out for other primary grades.
PCAR is designed to address the inadequacies in the primary school curriculum and aims to

bring about needed reforms in primary education. PCAR is to be accompanied by sufficient
teachers and learning materials and the number of examinable subjects have been reduced.

Planning and management issues

2.3.6 Inadequate planning and management capacity is yet another constraint confronting
the education system. Although the Education Management Information System (EMIS) of
the MoE has significantly improved in the last two years and education plans have been
developed for the districts, the shortage of professionally qualified planners and inadequate
mechanisms for gathering data still remain a problem. In addition, despite efforts made in
recent years in providing training in management to district education officers, school
inspectors and school managers, and the decentralization of the education services, there are
weaknesses in the management of the system and the decentralization process is still
incomplete.

HIV/AIDS Issue

2.3.7 In Malawi, the education system is also seriously affected by HIV/AIDS, through
increased teacher absenteeism, resulting from teachers being sick, taking care of the sick and
attending funerals; and mortality, and a growing number of children who are orphaned and
therefore at greater risk of repeating or dropping out of school. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS
is estimated at 14% among the 15—49 year old population and the impact on the teaching
population is very serious. According to the 2005 education data, 737 primary school teachers
and 166 secondary school teachers died during the year. A significant proportion of these
deaths are from HIV/AIDS-related illnesses. The 2005 data also indicates that about 440,000
primary school pupils (14% of the enrollment) were orphans, with 33% of them losing both
parents. Approximately 70 % of all orphans are HIV/AIDS orphans.

2.3.8 To combat the HIV/AIDS in the education sector, the MoE developed an HIV/AIDS
strategic plan for the sector for the period 2005—2008. The plan is in line with the National
Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS and is a culmination of a national process that started in
2000. A Life Skills Education was developed for primary and secondary schools and
integrated Sexual and Reproductive Health Education into the curriculum in order to bring
about behavior change. In addition, mechanisms for counseling on HIV/AIDS, its impact,
infection and affection have been developed for the dissemination of HIV/AIDS messages.
School health is expected to improve, thanks to the definition and implementation of an
adequate school health strategy, relevant sensitization and information on hygiene, HIV/AIDS
and other diseases for teachers and pupils, as well as integration of school health issues into
school programs.

2.3.9 The MoE’s strategic plan for HIV/AIDS is comprehensive, providing direction as
well as practical measures to contain the problem. It is also funded by resources provided by
the National Aids Council, which coordinates all HIV/AIDS activities in the country. The
government has mobilized resources from donors and private sector and has included funding
for HIV/AIDS intervention in its recurrent budget; 2% of the education recurrent budget is
earmarked for HIV/AIDS activities. But effective implementation of the MoE HIV/AIDS
strategic plan has been slowed by inadequate human resources capacity in the education
sector. The MoE is aware of the problem and is committed to putting corrective measures in
place. The revival of the HIV/AIDS technical working group, made up of MoE staff and

representatives of the development partners, is also expected to assist in bringing about
improvements in the implementation of the Ministry’s HIV/AIDS strategy.

2.4 Education Financing

2.4.1 In 1994, when free primary education (FPE) was introduced, total education
expenditure increased from 12 to 18 percent of the total government expenditure, but this has
declined over the years to 10—15 percent. Recurrent expenditures have also ﬂuctuated over the
years, but on average it stayed at 15 percent of the total government recurrent expenditure
since 1994. Domestic spending on education as % of GDP averaged 4% from 1993/94 to
2003/04, but total expenditure was much higher at about 6% of GDP, due to the financing of
most development expenditure by external partners. Domestic expenditure as a share of GDP
is higher than the average for the region, but Malawi’s GDP per capita is one of the lowest in
the region. Therefore, given its high primary school gross enrolment ratio, funding for the
sector as a share of the GDP should exceed the regional average in order to ensure sufficient
funding for the sector. Table 1 summarizes education sector expenditure by government and
donors in recent years.

2.4.2 Households bear a significant amount of the cost of education, although primary
education is free. Parents and local communities contribute to education through sharing in
the cost of buildings and their maintenance, transport to schools, food, school uniforms,
learning materials and extra-curricular activities. At the secondary level, students have to pay
school fees in addition. Private schooling has increased significantly in recent years, mostly at
the secondary level. At the secondary level students also contribute to school textbook
revolving funds as detailed in paragraph 3.16.

2.4.3 About 58% of the education recurrent expenditure is allocated to primary education,
up from the 50% in 1994, indicating government commitment to increasing access to quality
basic education. About 80% of the allocation for primary education goes to meeting salaries,
leaving only 18% for other recurrent transactions, including the provision of instructional
materials. Allocations to secondary education ﬂuctuated from 10—15 percent over the years,
while the share of recurrent expenditure to higher education is 15—20 percent. The larger
allocation to higher education compared to secondary education, which has over 35 times
more students than higher education, indicates the need for the rationalization of the
allocation of the resources across education sub—sectors. Within the secondary education sub-
sector, there are also serious inequities in the allocation of resources. While per pupil
spending is about US$40 in secondary as a whole, per pupil spending at the CDSSs, where the
majority of secondary school students attend, is about US$20. Clearly there is a need for
shifting more resources to CDSSs.

2.5 Donor Interventions in the Education Sector

 

2.5.1

Donors play an important role in the financing of the Malawian education system. This

is particularly the case with regard to development expenditures. Available data on budgeting of
external funds during the period 2003/04 showed that the donors contributed 98% (US$ 35.4
million) of the development expenditure, which was about 28% of the MoE’s US$ 127.3
million total expenditure (US$ 91.9 million recurrent expenditure and US$ 35.4 million
development expenditure). In addition to the main education donors, NGOs support education
mainly through the construction of school buildings. Development partners active in the sector
include: ADB, CIDA, DFID, KfW, GTZ, JICA, UNICEF, UNFPA, USAID and the World

Bank. Table 2.2 summarizes the size of support by each agency and the area of support.

2.5.2 Donor support is focused on improving access and equity, quality and relevance and
the planning and management capacity for all levels of the system. In the area of access and
equity, the emphasis has been on the construction and rehabilitation of primary and secondary
schools. In the area of quality and relevance, the focus has been on: teacher training including
in—service teacher training; the construction and rehabilitation of teacher training colleges and
Teacher Development Centers; curriculum review and development; provision of text books;
enhancement of school health and sanitation; provision of safe drinking water; awareness
creation related to HIV/AIDS and the introduction and popularization of the life skills’
curriculum; and on the improvement of school assessment systems. With respect to
management and planning, donor resources have been directed toward: the development of
national and district level education strategies; national school mapping and census exercises;
the development of an education management information system; the construction and
rehabilitation of district education offices; training of educational managers, teachers and
other educational stakeholder groups.

2.6 Education Policy Framework

 

2.6.1 The Government, as part of its Education and Training Policy, has approved the
Education Sector: Policy and Investment Framework (PIF). The PIF’s main objective for the
education system is the improvement of access to basic education by a net enrolment ratio of
95% in all districts by 2012. At the secondary school level, the objective is to increase the
gross enrollment ratio from the 18% in 2000 of the relevant age cohort to 30% during the
same period. Participation in tertiary education is to be raised from the 0.3% in 2000 of the
relevant age group to 1%. Accordingly, appropriate measures for reducing poor attendance,
enrollment, repetition and dropout are stated.

2.6.2 In addition, the government policy in education intends to:

o Decentralize education and training by empowering regions, districts, communities
and educational institutions to manage and administer education and training;

0 Promote equity through making access to basic education available to all citizens as
a basic right, encouraging equitable distribution of educational institutions and
resources, and expanding and improving girls' education.

0 Improve the quality of education and training through strengthening in-service
teacher training programs, the supply of teaching and learning materials, and teacher
trainer's programs;

0 Promote science and technology through strengthening science and technical
education, and development of a policy for the ICT education;

0 Combat HIV/AIDS through provision of HIV/AIDS education at all levels of the
education system.

2.6.3 A National Education Sector Plan has been developed, with the objective of
providing a blueprint for implementation of the PIF and the stimulation of a sector wide

approach (SWAP) to the development of education.

2.7 Education Sector Plan (ESP)

 

2.7.1 The MoE has developed a national Education Sector Plan for the period 2005—2015,
which aims to translate the policies and priorities of the PIF into a sector policy
implementation plan that will facilitate a move to a SWAP, which will give government better

control of resources and an efficient mechanism that avoids piecemeal interventions that lead
to duplication and inefficiencies.

2.7.2 The ESP is a comprehensive national program, intended to be linked to the MoE
budget and the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). The overall objectives are to improve the access to, quality and relevance of education
as well as to optimize the use of resources and to move management of the system closer to
the points of delivery. However, several issues still need to be resolved before the ESP
becomes fully operational. These include the establishment of a secretariat to manage the
ESP, fiduciary arrangements for the implementation of the plan, and agreement on a
memorandum of understanding that defines how the Ministry and the development partners
will cooperate in the financing and the implementation of the plan. There is also a need to
update the plan’s costings, which were made in May 2005, and present them in MTEF. In
2005, the plan’s cost projections were US$ 925 million for primary education and US$ 297
million for secondary education for the 10—year period of the plan. To move the process
forward, the ESP will be the subject of the annual joint sector review in 2006.

2.8 Challenges and Constraints in the Education Sector

 

2.8.1 The major challenges facing the Malawi education sector include improving the
quality of primary education, increasing access to and improving the quality of secondary
education, increasing girls’ access to secondary and tertiary education and improving the
relevance of the education provided. Insufficient funding of the sector and inefficient use of
available resources are major constraints to meeting these challenges of providing equitable
quality education at all levels. The widespread poverty in the country and the severe impact of
HIV/AIDs are also immense constraints to the provision of quality education.

2.8.2 The education system in Malawi has experienced major changes in recent years. The
introduction of Free Primary Education (FPE) in 1994 has expanded access to primary
education significantly. Access to secondary education has also increased and a new
university has been opened. But while these developments have created educational
opportunities for many children, they have also placed additional stress on an education
system that was already weak in terms of human and financial resources. There is a severe
shortage of qualified teachers and instructional materials, and physical facilities are very
inadequate. Consequently, the quality of education provided is very poor and pupil attainment
levels are very low. The internal efficiency of the system is a serious problem as the level of
dropout and repetition rates are very high. Adequate capacity for planning and managing the
education system is also lacking, constraining the delivery of educational services.

3. THE SUB-SECTOR

3.1 Secondary Education

3.1.1 Secondary education begins after the eight year primary education cycle, and consists of
a junior and senior cycle. The junior cycle consist of the first two years of secondary education
after which students sit for the JCE. The great majority of students who pass this examination
continue to senior secondary education, also consisting of two years. From the point of view of
employment or further education and training, the J CE is of minimal value and there have been
calls for its abolition. However, successful completion of the final two years of secondary

10

education qualifies eligible students to sit for the MSCE that opens a variety of opportunities in
terms of employment and further training for those who pass it.

3.1.2 The school census survey of 2005 indicated that there are 978 secondary schools,
which enroll 183,854 students (about 17% of the age cohort), with girls comprising 43% of
the secondary school enrolment. The secondary school education is offered mainly through
four types of schools, namely: conventional secondary schools (CSSs), community day
secondary schools (CDSSs), grant aided secondary schools and private secondary schools.
CSSs are government supported schools and are the most privileged with regard to
educational infrastructure and quality of teaching staff. There are 95 CSSs enrolling 41,412
students, 41% of whom are girls. The CSSs enroll 23% of the secondary school population.
CDSSs, previously known as Distance Education Centres (DECs), are also government
schools established with community assistance and they are the most disadvantaged. There
are 553 CDSSs with an enrolment of 84,351 students, 40% of whom are girls. The CDSS
enroll 46% of the students at the secondary level, which is 66% of the students in the
government run schools. The third group of schools is grant—aided schools. These schools are
owned by non profit organizations but are also supported by the government and are of
similar quality as CSSs. There are 55 grant aided schools enrolling 15,382 students, 49% of
whom are girls. The students in the grant aided schools make about 8% of the secondary
school enrolment. The fourth category is that of private schools managed by individual
entrepreneurs with no subsidy from government. The majority of these private schools are
comparable to CDSSs from the point of view of the available teaching/learning resources.
There are 259 registered private secondary schools enrolling about 39,887 students, of whom
47% are girls. Students in the registered private schools make up 22% of secondary school
enrolment. No accurate statistics are available on the number of students attending
unregistered private secondary schools.

Access and equity in secondary education

 

3.1.3 Expanding access to primary education has traditionally been a primary concern of the
government of Malawi since 1994. This emphasis has resulted, however, in a lower attention to
secondary education. But the increased enrolment and retention at the primary level inevitably
increased demand for the next levels. Accordingly, the government policy gives increased
importance to raising the enrolment in secondary education from 17% in 2005 with 43% girls to
30% by 2012, with 50% being girls, as stipulated in the PIF. This would include an increased
role for the private sector and community involvement in the provision of secondary education.
The government policy also makes provision for the promotion and strengthening of secondary
education programs involving CDSSs, which provide secondary education to the neediest
segment of the secondary school age group, and continuing education for the unqualified
teachers who staff these schools. Furthermore, although the proportion of girls in secondary
education has increased in recent years and some policies and actions to promote girl’s education
in secondary have been put in place, there is a need to examine more deeply the issues related to
further expanding access for girls and improving their retention in the schools.

Quality of secondary education

 

3.1.4 In addition to the low access, the quality of secondary education provided is also poor,
especially at the CDSSs. Examination results taken as one of the standard measurements of
quality reveal that the overall students’ performance is poor. In 2004 only 45% of the students
who sat for the MSCE passed the exam. Although this is an improvement over earlier years

11

(25% of the candidates passed the MSCE in 2002 and 32% passed in 2003), the student
achievement as measured by the MSCE results is still very low. This low quality of the
secondary education provided is largely attributed to the inadequate levels of qualified
teachers, insufficient teaching and learning materials, shortage of teaching facilities, and
deficient school management and supervision.

3.1.5 There are an estimated 8,975 teachers (1723 or 19% female) in the secondary school
system. About 72% of these teachers are not qualified for secondary school teaching,
adversely affecting the quality of education provided. In most CSSs, the curriculum is
delivered by qualified teachers, but in the CDSSs, the great majority (86%) of the teachers are
academically and professionally under—qualified. The conversion of distance education centers
to CDSS in 1998 increased the need for secondary teachers as students are taught face to face.
Some primary teachers have been reassigned to teach at CDSSs. These teachers are considered
untrained or unqualified to teach at secondary schools until they complete a secondary teacher—
training program. The challenge for the Ministry is increasing the number of qualified teachers
graduating from secondary teacher programs plus upgrading the qualifications of the under—
qualified teachers. In addition strategies for addressing these challenges need to be reviewed.

3.1.6 The inadequate provision of teaching and learning materials also negatively impacts on
the education provided. In line with government policy of supplying schools with an initial stock
of books, textbooks for Form IV students have been provided in 2004 for secondary schools
which did not have the books. Textbooks for Form III students were also supplied in 2002 to
some schools. But most CDSSs are critically short of or lacking textbooks for Form I, II and III,
which make up over 50% of the secondary school enrolment in govemment-run secondary
schools. For example in Form I there is only one book for 6 students in life skills, a core and
an important subject. Provision of an initial stock of textbooks at least for core subjects for Form
I, II and III students at CDSSs will enhance the conditions for effective teaching and learning at
these schools. The ESP proposes a student to textbook ratio of 2:1 and, once an initial stock of
textbooks are provided, availability of textbooks is to be sustained through the schools Textbook
Revolving Fund (TRF). Schools retain MWK 250 of the school fees per student each year
towards the TRF which each school maintains to partially finance their school needs. But the
amount collected is not adequate to meet the textbook needs of schools, hence the need for the
provision of an initial stock of textbooks and teachers’ guides, which then could be
maintained through the TRF. Furthermore, as part of bringing about reforms in post-primary
education, strategies for improving the provision of textbooks and the functioning of the TRF
need to be examined.

3.1.7 Similarly, the lack of sufficient number of classrooms, science—teaching facilities and
libraries, principally at the CDSSs, undermines the quality of teaching at these secondary
schools. At most CDSSs the condition of existing, if any, classrooms does not provide conducive
environment for teaching and learning to take place and most schools lack libraries and facilities
for teaching science. Provision of these resources to needy CDSSs will assist in the improvement
of the quality of teaching at the secondary level.

3.1.8 The quality of the secondary education is also affected by the inadequate training of
school managers and the insufficient capacity for school inspection. At the CDSSs 50 percent of
the school managers have received management training aimed at improving their management
skills under the on—going ADF education project, but the remaining half lack the skills needed to
effectively manage the schools under their responsibility. Also, the number of secondary school
inspectors is inadequate for adequate inspection and monitoring of the implementation of the

12

secondary school curriculum. The ESP proposes the recruitment of an additional 54 inspectors
and the reinvigoration of the secondary school cluster system. To build capacity for secondary
school management, training for CDSS managers is therefore needed. In addition, although
secondary school inspectorates by and large satisfy the govemment’s basic qualification criteria,
the need for staff development once they have joined the inspectorate is critical, as most of them
are not exposed to in—service training activities regularly. Reinvigorating the secondary school
cluster system, which facilitates school-based in—service teacher training and collaboration
among subject teachers, would require as well the provision of the needed recurrent expenditure.

Relevance of secondary education

 

3.1.9 An important indicator of the quality of education is external efficiency. The
government's policy, as articulated in the ESP is to increase the number of secondary school
students to 300,000 by 2015 from the current level of about 184,000. This increase of over 60%
of the secondary school enrolment will inevitably lead to increased demand by those completing
secondary level for more opportunities in higher education and training and/or absorption into
the labor market. But according to the ESP, the present secondary education system is not
sufficiently responsive to the needs of the vast number of students who will not be proceeding to
higher education. Hence the ESP proposes a review of the post primary education for whole
school development, including reforms in curriculum, teacher education and school
management. Given the crucial role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in
modern economies, the ESP also proposes the development of ICT policy for secondary
education. Both of these actions will assist in mapping out a direction for improving the
relevance of secondary education. At the primary level, in recent years significant progress has
been made in undertaking reforms, including the development of a new curriculum and strategies
for improving teacher education, but at the secondary level essential reforms that would lead to
improvements in the relevance of the education provided need to be initiated.

4. THE PROJECT

4.1 Project Concept and Rationale

 

4.1.1 Malawi has made significant progress in the expansion of secondary education, which
includes the last two years of basic education, in the past decade, but the quality of secondary
education remains very low, adversely affecting the quality of primary education through its
impact on the quality of primary school teachers, and negatively impacting on the skill levels of
the working population. The quality of secondary education is especially poor at the CDSSs,
where 46% of secondary school students attend. In 2004, overall 45% of the candidates passed
the MSCE. At the CSSs, 68% passed the MSCE. But at the CDSSs, the pass rate was only 38%,
reﬂecting the insufficient learning outcomes at the CDSSs. Compared to other public secondary
schools, the CDSSs are under-funded, the majority of their teachers (86%) are under—qualified,
teaching and learning materials are lacking, infrastructure facilities are inadequate to provide
acceptable levels of teaching and learning, and the level of school management competencies are
considered very low.

4.1.2 The Ministry of Education and development partners have agreed that a broad program
approach is the best instrument to reach the government's educational goals. A long—term
National Education Sector Plan for Basic and Secondary Education has thus been developed by
the MoE. The ESP specifies the secondary education sector's objectives and will guide planning
and activities over the life of a 10 year multiple phase program (2005—2015). The proposed ADF

13

project, with a time frame of five years (2006—2011), will support components of the ESP aimed
specifically at improving the quality and relevance of secondary education.

4.1.3 The project was prepared with the extensive participation of staff from all
departments of the Ministry of Education. Various aspects of the project were also discussed
and validated with members of other development partners active in the Malawi education
sector to maximize resource utilization and attainment of the set objectives. It was agreed that
secondary education, and particularly CDSSs, deserve immediate attention if the quality of
education offered in Malawi at this level is to show any significant improvements and if the
skills of the working population are to be brought to levels essential for attainment of
sustained economic growth. ADF support for efforts aimed at improving the quality of
secondary education, which includes the last two years of basic education, is therefore
appropriate and will further Malawi’s attempts to realize its educational goals. Future ADF
support in this direction will also reinforce the objectives of the on-going ADF Education IV
Project, which aims to contribute to improvements in the quality of secondary education
provided at CDSSs. The concentration of donor support at the primary level and poor funding
of secondary education compared to higher education give additional reasons for continued
Bank support to the secondary sub—sector.

4.1.4 Support for the project is also consistent with the country’s strategies for reducing
poverty as outlined in the MGDS. In recognition of the impact of access to quality education
on poverty reduction, improvement of the quality of secondary education, particularly in rural
areas, has been accorded a central position in the MGDS. The project is also in line with the
Bank’s assistance strategy for Malawi, which is to assist the country in its efforts to alleviate
poverty through the promotion of the 2005-2009 CSP that revolves around interventions in
two pillars of the MGDS: (i) Pillar I — Expanding Rural Infrastructure; and (ii) Pillar II —
Developing Human Capital and Institutional Capacity. The project supports the second pillar
of the CSP, namely developing human capital and institutional capacity. In addition, the
project is consistent with the Bank’s education sector policy which advocates the
improvement of the quality of basic and upper secondary education as a way of improving the
provision of middle level skills in regional member countries. The project also complements
the assistance provided by other development partners as well as building on the
achievements of completed and on-going ADF education projects.

Bank support for the sector and lessons learned

4.1.5 To date the Bank has funded four education projects in Malawi. The first three
projects approved in 1980, 1986 and 1997 for ADF loans of UA 7.37 million, UA 15.66
million and UA 12.00 million respectively are complete. The fourth project approved in 2001
is on-going and is being implemented satisfactorily. The projects aimed in general to increase
access and improve the quality of primary and secondary education, and build capacity for
educational planning and management. For example, the recently completed Education III
Project, has established 10 new primary schools with a capacity of 9,600 school spaces, 3 new
day secondary schools with a minimum capacity of 1,440 school spaces; 2 new district
offices; supported in—service training for over 6,000 under-qualified primary school teachers;
provided textbooks for Form IV students in about 700 secondary schools; and supported long—
term training for MoE staff. The borrower project completion report recently submitted for
the Education III Project concludes that the project was successfully completed with outputs
far exceeding those planned at appraisal. The Bank’s project completion report is planned to
be prepared in 2006.

14

4.1.6 The on-going Education IV Project, which focuses on the secondary sub—sector, is
supporting improvements in the physical facilities and instructional materials at 40 CDSSs;
in-service training of 1,000 under-qualified science and math CDSS teachers; training of 300
CDSS head teachers; and building capacity for planning and developing secondary teacher
education and school inspection at MoE. The project, although experienced start—up delays
due to delays in fulfillment of loan conditions, is expected to be completed within the planned
period and achieve its objectives.

4.1.7 The new project will reinforce the achievements of these projects and will
particularly upscale the activities supported by the on-going Education IV Project as both
projects focus on improvements in the quality of secondary education especially at CDSSs.
Lessons learned from the implementation of the earlier projects will also inform the new
project. The measures that assisted in improving the implementation of the recently completed
Education III Project and the on-going Education IV Project, and which can be applied to the
implementation of the new project, include: (i) adequate oversight of the Ministry on the
implementation of project activities and close coordination with those of other development
partners; (ii) the existence of effective project management team knowledgeable about Bank
procurement procedures; (iii) the active involvement of the MoE’s departments of teacher
education, planning, secondary education and inspectorate in the implementation of training
activities; (iv) the continuous dialogue with the government on the provision of adequate
counterpart funds, which has been an impediment to timely completion of some activities; and
(v) the adequate supervision of the project by the Bank.

4.1.8 A 2006 review of the Bank portfolio in Malawi concludes that the performance of
the Bank Group Portfolio in Malawi is generally satisfactory. However, some recurrent
problems remain, and to improve the performance of the current as well as future operations,
the report on the portfolio review recommends that (i) the government should improve the
timeliness of the fulfillment of loan/grant conditions; ensure regular disbursement of
counterpart funds; increase efforts to strengthen capacity at PIUs; and improve weak
accounting and auditing systems/reporting; and (ii) the Bank should improve grant condition
design (to reﬂect government’s implementation ability); drop the requirement that
government provides counterpart funds; continue/increase capacity-building training
activities; increase the level of harmonization and coordination with other donors; speed—up
the opening of the Country Office; and strengthen supervision missions/teams in line with
project components. Annex IV gives the list of on-going Bank Group operations in Malawi.

4.2 Project Area and Project Beneficiaries

 

4.2.1 The project sites will be distributed throughout the country. However, since most
CDSSs serve remote rural communities, the schools that the project will support will be
located in disadvantaged rural areas. And the majority of the beneficiaries of the improved
learning conditions will be students from these disadvantaged communities. Thirty schools,
one per district, will be supported by the project. The list of schools to be supported by the
project was determined through a process involving district assembles and district local
education authorities. Each district assembly and its local education authorities selected their
school. The selection criteria set by the MoE was that the school should be one that is
overcrowded, with very inadequate infrastructure and with many feeder primary schools.
Annex V gives the list of the schools and districts at which they are located.

15

4.2.2 Initially, the most direct beneficiaries of the project will be students enrolled in the
secondary schools that will be supported through the project. 30 CDSSs, one per district, will
be supported. Each of these schools will receive four classrooms and a laboratory, which
means that almost 8,000 students will benefit from the improved secondary school education
in any given time.

4.2.3 Other beneficiaries of the project will include Form I, II and III CDSSs students (about
60,000) throughout the country who will receive textbooks for core subjects; 400 under—
qualified science and mathematics CDSS teachers who will receive in-service training that
will upgrade their qualifications; and 300 CDSS school head teachers and 54 school
inspectors who receive training that will enhance their capacities to fulfill their duties more
effectively. The MoE will also benefit by receiving the technical assistance required to
examine the reforms needed in the secondary education sub—sector.

4.3 Strategic Context

4.3.1 The project aims to contribute to the objectives of the Education Sector Plan (ESP) for
2005—2015, which provides a basis for a future Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) to the
development of the sector and for facilitating sourcing of additional donor support from the
Fast Track Initiative (FTI). The ESP is a comprehensive plan for the development of
education over the next 10 years and aims primarily at contributing to improving access to
quality formal and non—formal basic and secondary education. In this context, the ESP is the
government’s instrument for advancing Malawi’s MDG’s for education. By supporting the
achievement of the objectives of the ESP, the project will therefore contribute to efforts aimed
at reaching the MDGs.

4.3.2 The ESP will guide the allocation of resources from the government budget and from
the development partners. The funds from the project will therefore be focused on priority
areas in the ESP, thus improving their efficient utilization. However, as pointed out in
paragraph 2.7.2, several issues, including management and fiduciary arrangements for the
implementation of the plan, need to be resolved before the ESP becomes fully operational and
facilitates the move to SWAP. These issues are unlikely to be resolved before the ADF grant
that supports the project enters into force. Therefore, although the project will support specific
components of the ESP, the institutional arrangements for the implementation of project
activities will include, as described in section 5 of the report, the engagement of a project
management technical team and the Bank’s procurement and disbursement procedures will be
followed. However, once the management and fiduciary arrangements for the SWAP are in
place, this institutional arrangement will be adjusted to bring it fully under the control of the
SWAP implementation arrangement.

4.3.3 Finally, given that the ESP objectives are key elements of the government’s poverty
reduction strategy, the project will, through ESP, contribute to efforts to reduce poverty in the
country. At present, Malawi relies on one economic sector, namely agriculture. But there are
several constraints to this sector supporting the growing population. Therefore, there is a need
to diversify the economy and invest in the development of human capital required for the
diversification of economic activities. By supporting improvements of the quality of
secondary education, the project will assist in this direction by building the middle level skills
needed for diversifying the economy.

16

4.4 Project Objective

The overall sector goal is to achieve universal primary education and increased access
and improved quality with gender parity in post —primary education. The objective of the
project is to contribute to improved quality, equity and relevance of secondary education,
especially at the CDSSs in the country. This will be achieved through the establishment of
physical facilities, provision of educational materials, and support for capacity building,
including training of under—qualified teachers and school managers, and policy development
for secondary education reform.

4.5 Project Description

4.5.1 The project will have four components namely (i) infrastructure development, (ii)
education material provision, (iii) capacity building and policy development for secondary
education, and (v) project management. The project will be implemented over a period of five
years with the following outputs:

0 At each of the 30 CDSSs to be supported by the project, an administration and staff
block, 4 classrooms, a library, a laboratory, 2 houses for teachers, pit latrines, a fence,
and borehole constructed; classroom and office furniture and equipment supplied;
science equipment, textbooks and library books supplied and distributed;

0 Initial stock of textbooks and teachers’ guides for 60,000 Form I ,II and III CDSSs
students for core subjects provided;

0 Qualifications of 400 under-qualified CDSSs teachers upgraded through distance

learning;

Training for 300 CDSS school managers and 54 secondary school inspectors provided;

Policy for ICT for secondary education developed;

Post—primary education reviewed;

Technical support for project management provided.

The details under each component are as follows:
Component 1: Infrastructure Development

4.5.2 In view of the need to improve the quality of secondary, particularly at CDSSs in all
the districts of Malawi and especially in the rural areas, this component aims to assist in
improving the physical facilities at 30 CDSSs to create a conducive environment for learning
and consequently contribute to improvements in the quality of education provided. In the
schools the project will assist, the classrooms are either dilapidated, overcrowded or non—
existent resulting in an environment not conducive for learning. In addition, laboratories for
the teaching of science, libraries, latrines, reliable source of water, staff houses, playgrounds
and fence walls are either inadequate or lacking, hence the need to provide the necessary
infrastructure to meet the minimum physical standards set by the government for secondary
schools. The support provided by the project to the 30 CDSSs will add to that made available
by the on-going Education V Project to 40 CDSSs, resulting in the improvement of learning
conditions at 70 of the country’s poorly resourced CDSSs.

4.5.3 The above components will be achieved through a range of activities under the
following categories of expenditure:

17

(A) Civil Works
4.5.4 Civil Works under Component 1 will comprise new construction and external works
at 30 existing CDSSs in 30 districts, one school per district.

Each CDSS will be provided with the following facilities:

0 Administration block with offices for the head teacher and his deputy, bursar, store
and a staff room;

Four (4) classrooms in two (2) buildings;

Laboratory and Library block;

Two (2) staff houses;

One (1) Pit Latrine block for students and staff both male and female;

One borehole

Access roads and parking, sports grounds, fences, gate and gate house, walkways and
storm water drainage.

(B) Goods

4.5.5 The project will support procurement of classroom and office furniture as well as
office equipment. The PIU will prepare detailed specifications for both furniture and
equipment before tendering.

4.5.6 The furniture required for the new buildings will be provided under the project in
accordance with specified lists prepared by MoE. Built—in furniture will be taken care of in
the construction contracts. Loose furniture will mainly consist of tables, chairs, desks,
storage, display units and any other items of furniture required for the functioning of schools.
As much as possible preference will be given to locally produced furniture to ensure ease of
maintenance and replacement. The CDSSs will be provided with adequate general office
equipment in accordance with the MoE list of standard office equipment and supplies for
institutions of that category.

(C) Services

4.5.7 Consultancy services both for Architectural and Engineering for new construction in
the existing CDSSs will be undertaken based on site surveys including levels and soil
conditions. The standard designs already prepared by the PIU will be adapted to the various
sites taking into consideration adjustment to contours and other parameters. After tendering
and selection of contractors, carried out by the PIU, post-contract services and site
supervision will be carried out by consultants until final completion. The consultants will
apart from regularly visiting the sites also maintain their various clerk of works for day—to—
day supervision for the duration of the contracts. The PIU will handle the supervision of sites
furthest from the urban areas where the consultants are based as a means of reducing cost.

Component 2: Educational Materials Provision

4.5.8 Given the inadequate supply of books and other teaching/learning materials and the
lack of science teaching equipment this component will provide for these materials, in as
much as they enhance the quality and efficiency of secondary education provided at the
CDSSs. Although there have been improvements in the availability of textbooks in secondary
schools in recent years, there is still a severe shortage of textbooks especially at the CDSSs,
which serve poorer communities. Schools retain MWK 250 of the school fees per student
each year towards the textbook revolving fund which each school maintains to partially

18

finance their school needs. But the amount collected is not adequate to meet the textbook
needs of schools. Therefore the ESP proposes that each school should receive an initial stock
of textbooks and teachers’ guides, which then could be maintained through the TRF. As for
science teaching materials, CDSS students, unlike those who attend CSSs, have no access to
these resources, as none of the CDSSs in the country, apart from the 40 CDSSs being
upgraded by the on-going ADF education project, have a science teaching area equipped with
science teaching materials.

4.5.9 The above component will be achieved through the following category of
expenditure:

(B) Goods

4.5.10 An initial stock of textbooks and teachers’ guides for Form I, II and III students
(60,000) at a rate of one book for two students for core subjects will be provided to CDSSs
where these books are in short supply. Textbooks for Form IV students have already been
supplied in 2004 under the recently completed ADF Education III Project. Textbooks for all
students at the 40 CDSSs supported under the on-going ADF Education IV Project have also
been provided in 2006 and will not therefore receive books from this project.

4.5.11 Library books and science teaching equipment and consumables will be provided to
the 30 CDSSs upgraded under component I.

Component 3: Capacity Building and Policy Development for Secondary Education

4.5.12 The component aims to support MoE efforts to reduce the number of under-qualified
teachers in CDSSs, through the provision of in—service training. In addition the component
will assist in efforts to build capacity for school management at the CDSSs through the
provision of training to school managers as well as school inspectors involved in the delivery
of secondary education. Furthermore the component will support consultancy services for
policy development for ICT education at the secondary level and for review of post primary
education for whole school development, including reforms needed to be undertaken in
curriculum, teacher education, school management, cluster systems, textbook provision, girls’
education and maintenance of school facilities.

4.5.13 The activities under the component will be achieved through the following category
of expenditure:

(C) Services

4.5.14 The project will support an in-service training program for 400 under-qualified
CDSSs teachers through the combination of distance education and short residential courses.
The program will be a continuation of the one currently provided at Domasi College of
Education but expanded to double the number of teachers to be upgraded, using facilities at at
other higher education institutions in the country. The Ministry considers the program at
Domasi College of Education, which was running since 2000 with support from CIDA, very
successful and should be expanded to meet the training needs of more CDSSs teachers.
Science and mathematics CDSS teachers who have received the 12 week bridging course at
Mzuzu University with the support of the on-going Education IV Project will be the pool of
candidates from which the target group for the training will be selected. Preference will be
given to female CDSS teachers in the selection of candidates for the training. In addition to
raising the competency levels and teaching skills of the teachers in math and science, the

19

training will cover HIV/AIDS issues in secondary education. The Department of Teacher
Education (DTED) of the MoE will submit a detailed training program to the Bank for
approval, following grant effectiveness.

4.5.15 Training in school management will be provided to 300 CDSS school managers. The
training, which will consist of three-week duration, will be a continuation of the one currently
carried out for 300 CDSS head teachers under the on-going ADF education project and
managed by DTED. The training includes a module on gender issues, aimed at sensitizing
teachers and head teachers on girls’ needs in the classroom and the school, and a module that
deals with HIV/AIDS issues in education.

4.5.16 Training in school inspection for the 54 secondary school inspectors to be recruited
under the ESP will be provided. The content and duration of training will be determined by
the Education, Methods and Advisory Services (EMAS) department of the MoE and
communicated to the Bank for approval. EMAS staff trained outside the country under the on—
going ADF education project, will act as resource persons and will spearhead the provision of
the training for the new inspectors. The training will be carried out in the country.

4.5.17 Consultancy service for the development of a policy for ICT in secondary education
will be supported by the project for a total period of 12 person—months. The purpose of the
support is to map out policies, strategies and resource requirements of the provision of ICT
education at the secondary level. The ICT policy for the sub—sector will be developed within
the framework of the country’s ICT policy formulated in 2003.

4.5.18 Consultancy services will be supported to review post primary education to assist
MoE in initiating needed reforms in secondary education, including reforms in curriculum,
teacher education, school management, functioning of cluster systems, provision of textbooks,
and maintenance of school facilities, and close examination of issues related to girls’
education. The support will assist MoE recruit short—term consultants and finance workshops.
Ten consultancy services each of 12 week duration and associated workshops will be
supported.

Component 4: Proiect Management

4.5.19 The management of the project will be carried out by the existing Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), currently managing the on-going ADF Education IV Project,
under the supervision of the planning department of the MoE and support from the
beneficiary departments of MoE such as DTED and EMAS.

4.5.20 The activities under the component will be achieved through the following categories
of expenditure:

(B) Goods
4.5.21 In view of the large number of project sites in deprived rural areas and the need for
regular supervision of the project activities, one more vehicle will be purchased to
complement the existing ﬂeet of PIU vehicles for project co—ordination and site supervision.
No additional office equipment will be needed since those provided by ongoing projects are
still available.

(C) Services

20

4.5.22 The project accounts will be audited annually and at the end of the project by an
external auditor.

(D) Operating Costs

4.5.23 The operational costs in carrying out the administration, co—ordination and
procurement activities necessary for the successful completion of the project, will be met by
the project for the 60 months of implementation. The operating costs will include the salaries
of the project staff, which are not paid by the government.

4.6 Environmental Impact

4.6.1 The project aims at procuring new construction for existing school infrastructures and
is therefore classified as category II according to the Bank’s environmental guidelines. With
the proper mitigation measures indicated below put in place, the project will have minimal
negative impact on the environment. The buildings to be constructed are single storey. In the
execution of civil works, the basic principles of environmental protection including the
preservation of existing trees not interfering with construction and the planting of new ones
will be encouraged. Since most of the schools do not have pipe—borne water, the construction
of boreholes as a guarantee for the availability of good drinking water will be a priority.
Moreover, the improved version of pit latrines, the ventilated improved pit latrines (VIP),
shall be erected in the schools. Small incinerators and septic tanks shall be built for the
disposal of laboratory waste and foul waste respectively. The Environmental and Social
Mitigation Plan is presented in Annex VI.

4.6.2 The burning of bricks with wood constitutes a serious environmental problem in the
light of the serious deforestation taking place all across the country. The production of burnt
bricks is a source of income for some people in the rural areas, but there is also the need to
promote an alternative material for construction as a means of halting the rapid degradation of
the fast disappearing forests. The first three ADF education projects have used burnt bricks
for construction of schools. But Stabilized Soil Blocks will be used for the 30 schools in the
Education V project as a follow—up to the use of the material in the 40 schools of the
Education IV project. The blocks are produced with block making machines contributing to
their quality.

4.7 Project Cost

4.7.1 The total cost of the project, net of taxes and customs duties, is estimated at UA 16.66
million, of which UA 11.77 million is in foreign exchange and the equivalent of UA 4.89
million is in local currency. All items have been priced in USD and converted into UA at the
exchange rate applicable in the Bank for the month of February 2006. A summary of project
cost estimates is given below in Table 4.1 by component and in Table 4.2 by category of
expenditure.

4.7.2 The cost estimates for civil works are based on averages worked out from tenders
submitted for the ongoing civil works under Education IV project. The cost estimates for
furniture, equipment and supplies are based on data obtained from the PIU. Physical
contingencies are set at 5% of base costs for all categories of expenditure. Price contingencies
are estimated at 3.2% inﬂation per year for both local costs and foreign currency costs. The
detailed project cost estimates are shown in the Project Implementation Document (PID) and
the provisional list of categories of expenditure is shown in Annex VII.

4.8 Sources of Financing and Expenditure Schedule

 

4.8.1 The project will be financed jointly by the ADF (90%) and the Government (10%) as
shown in Table 4.3. The ADF’s contribution, with a grant of UA 15 million, will cover 100%
of all foreign exchange costs and 66% of local costs. The Government will finance 34% of the
local costs, estimated at UA 1.66 million which represents 10% of the total project costs. All
foreign exchange requirements of the project will be borne by ADF funds.

4.8.2 The ADF will wholly fund the cost of goods, services, operating costs and 83.4% of
civil works. The Govemment’s contribution of UA 1.66 million in local currency,
representing 10.0% of the total cost and 16.6% of the civil works cost will partially finance
the category of expenditure for works. Tables 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) show the sources of finance
and sources of finance by category of expenditure. Annex VII gives the distribution of the
grant by component and category of expenditure.

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 Executing Agency

The Ministry of Education through its Planning Department will be the executing
agency and will steer the project to ensure that it is efficiently managed. The existing PIU,
currently responsible for the implementation of the ongoing Education IV, and integrated with
the regular operations of the MOE, will be retained for the management of the project, as it has
successfully and efficiently managed the completed and on—going ADF projects. The
technical staff of the PIU is made up of a project manager, who reports to the Director of
Planning, an accountant, an architect, a procurement officer (quantity surveyor) and an
engineer. The scope of the work is similar to that of the on-going project and therefore the
staffing of the PIU will stay at the present level. The five technical staff of the PIU are not
government civil servants. They are recruited through advertisement of the positions they hold
and are on two year performance based contracts, with salaries paid from project funds. MoE
staff from the DTED, EMAS, the Secondary Education Department and Planning Department
of MoE will also be involved in the implementation of some of the project activities as part of
their regular duties with no remunerations from the project. However, in line with the Paris
Declaration of Development Effectiveness, once a secretariat is established for the
implementation of the ESP and fiduciary arrangements are in place for the SWAP, the
management of the implementation of the project activities will be adjusted to bring it under
the full control of the SWAP management arrangement. This is because effective donor
coordination and harmonization of implementation arrangements are needed to lower
transaction costs of interventions and improve development effectiveness.

5.2 Institutional Arrangements

The Director of Planning of the Ministry of Education will oversee the execution of
the project, approving work plans and reviewing progress, as well as ensuring that the PIU
and other MoE departments responsible for the implementation of the project carry out their
duties. The project coordinator, under the direction of the director of planning, will be

24

responsible for the implementation of the operational activities related to the project,
including preparation of work plans and progress reports and supervision of the project staff.
The technical staff of the PIU (architect, quantity surveyor and engineer) will be responsible
for the implementation of the infrastructure component, preparing designs and tender
documents and supervising the construction works, whereas the accountant will be
responsible for the project accounts. Since the project involves a substantial civil works
component, the PIU will be assisted in the supervision of the civil works component of the
project by consultants. The capacity building and policy development component will be
implemented in close collaboration with DTED, EMAS, the Secondary Education
Departments and the Planning Department of MoE. The DTED will be responsible for the
planning and implementation of the training activities for teachers and head teachers, while
EMAS will be responsible for the training of school inspectors. The Planning Department and
the Secondary Education Department will be in charge of the management of the activities
related to policy development for ICT and review of post—primary education. Basic office
equipment is already provided under the on-going Education IV Project, but one vehicle for
supervision and necessary funds for the activities related to the implementation of the project
will be provided under the project management component.

5.3 Supervision and Implementation Schedules
The project will be implemented during a period of 5 years (60 months) from

effectiveness of the grant, assumed to be in the last quarter of 2006. The implementation
schedule is presented in Annex IX and administration activities are summarized as follows:

Works

5.4.2 Procurement of civil works valued at less than UA 500,000 per contract will be
carried out under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. 30 such contracts will be
awarded, for new construction at 30 Community Day Secondary Schools, valued in total at
UA 10.02 million. NCB is used because the character, location and size of the construction
works to be undertaken are unlikely to attract foreign bidders, as the schools are scattered all
over the country in rural areas, and there are local contractors sufficiently qualified and in a
number sufficient to ensure competitive bidding.

Goods

5.4.3 Six contracts for the supply and distribution of textbooks and library books valued in
total at UA 2.28 million, or about UA 0.35 million each, and one contract for science
laboratory equipment for 30 CDSSs valued in total at UA 0.29 million, will be procured under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.

26

5.4.4 One contract for office and general equipment for 30 schools valued at UA 0.12
million; and one contract for furniture for 30 schools valued UA 0.35 million will be awarded
under NCB procedures. This is because the goods are of such value and quantities that their
supply could not possibly interest suppliers outside the Borrowers’ country and there are local
suppliers sufficiently qualified and in a number sufficient to ensure competitive bidding.

5.4.5 One vehicle valued at UA 0.02 million to complement the existing ﬂeet of the PIU’s
vehicles, will be procured under National Shopping procedures. This is because the item is
small in value and is readily available locally.

Services

5.4.6 Consultancy services for supervision of new construction of 30 CDSSs, estimated at
UA 0.66 million, will be procured through shortlisting of firms in accordance with the Bank’s
Rules of Procedure for the Use of Consultants. The selection procedure will be based on the
technical quality with price consideration.

5.4.7 Consultancy Services for policy development for ICT and review of post primary
education are valued at UA 0.27 million. Selection will be through shortlisting of individual
consultants.

5.4.8 Training is valued in aggregate at UA 1.85 million. Training for CDSS teachers,
valued UA 1.66 million, will be procured through competition among a shortlist of training
institutions. Given the nature of the training the shortlist will comprise training institutions in
Malawi with the specific capacity in the required subject areas and single contract amounts
will not exceed UA 350,000. Training for CDSS school managers, valued UA 0.16 million,
and training for school inspectors, valued UA 0.03 million, will be procured through Direct
Negotiations with the Malawi Institute of Education. Direct negotiation is justified because
the identified institution has the requisite capacity, expertise and experience for such training,
as well as a good track record with the Borrower.

5.4.9 Consultancy service for auditing project accounts, valued at UA 0.04 million, will be
though a shortlist of firms. The selection procedure will be based on technical quality with
price consideration.

National Procedures and Regulations

5.4.10 Tender Procedures and Regulations from the Government of Malawi have been
reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Implementation

5.4.11 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), under the direction of the MoE, will be
responsible for the procurement of works, goods and services. The PIU has sufficient capacity
to manage all the procurement activities under this project. The PIU will submit a
procurement plan for the Bank’s no objection prior to the first launch of tenders.

27

General Procurement Notice

5.4.12 The text of a General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be agreed upon with the GoM
during negotiations and will be issued for publication in the United Nations Development
Business, upon the approval of the grant.

Review Procedures

5.4.13 The following documents are subject to review and approval by the Bank before
promulgation:

Specific Procurement Notices;

Shortlists and Requests for Proposals (RFP);

TORs for consultancy services and training institutions;

Lists, Designs, Specifications, Tender Documents, with Draft Contract Agreements for

Civil Works, Furniture and Equipment;

0 Tender Evaluation Reports, or Reports on Evaluation of Consultants’ Proposals,
including recommendations for Contract Award;

0 Draft contracts, if these have been amended from the drafts included in the tender
documents, and draft contracts for consultancy services and training;

0 Procurement Plan.

5.5 Disbursement Arrangements

 

5.5.1 The following disbursement methods will be followed for the various components and
categories of expenditure: one Special Account (SA) for civil works payments less than UA
20,000, operating costs and training, the establishment of which will be a condition precedent
to first disbursement; and direct payment method for professional services, equipment,
furniture and civil works payments greater than UA 20,000. The establishment of a Local
Currency Accounts for ADF grant and a separate Program under the annual budget of the
MoE for the allocation of the counterpart funds for the project will be required, and both of
these requirements will be a condition precedent to first disbursement.

5.5.2 An initial deposit for an amount corresponding to four months of activities as justified
by a work program approved by the Bank will be made in the SA. Subsequent replenishments
of the SA will be subject to the PIU having provided sufficient justifications for the use of at
least 50% of the previous deposit and upon production of agreed work program for the
following four months. To ensure adherence to agreed financial regulations, the special
accounts will be monitored by the ADF financial supervision and AUDIT missions.

5.6 Monitoring and Evaluation

 

5.6.1 The PIU, through the MoE, will submit to ADF Quarterly Project Progress Reports
(QPPR) in accordance with the established format covering all aspects of the project, within
30 days following the end of each quarter. The QPPR will cover progress measured against
indicators in the project matrix. As part of the preparation of QPPR, the Project Manager will
ensure the development of a Project Progress Chart, indicating percentage of disbursement
against implementation status of each component of the project. The project management will
also prepare and submit a project completion report in accordance with the format

28

recommended by ADF. Additional reports and clarifications will be submitted to the Fund as
required.

5.6.2 A mid—term review will be conducted after two years to evaluate progress. ADF will
be responsible for undertaking the review in collaboration with the MoE. A participatory
approach will be encouraged in the review process. In the event of the need for modification
of the project after the mid-term review, submissions will be made to ADF for consideration.

5.6.3 The key progress indicators for monitoring delivery of project inputs and
achievements of project outputs are described in the Project Matrix. Changes in these
indicators will be monitored through the data collected annually from the schools and analysis
by the planning department of the MoE. Recent improvements in the Education Management
and Information System of the MoE should assist in better monitoring and evaluation of the
outcomes.

5.7 Financial Reporting and Auditing

 

In order to ensure efficient monitoring of the project expenditure, the PIU will
maintain separate project accounts which should correspond to the project budget. Detailed
accounts concerning expenditure by the Bank and the Government should facilitate the
identification of expenditure by project component, category of expenditure and source of
finance. The accounts should clearly document disbursed amounts from the Bank and GoM.
The accounts and ledgers should be kept separately from any other project the PIU would
implement. External auditors will audit the project accounts annually and at the end of the
project. An Audit Report will be presented annually to the Bank, within six (6) months
following the end of each financial year.

5.8 Aid Coordination

The PIF is the guiding document for education development in Malawi. All
development partners active in the education sector support and assisted in the development
of the policies and priority strategies contained in the PIF. The development of the ESP is also
seen as an important stage in a process that will lead to the adoption of a Sector Wide
Approach (SWAP) that will strengthen aid coordination. However, until the ESP becomes
fully operational, the monthly government/development partners meetings and the annual
joint sector reviews will remain the main mechanisms for aid coordination. The Ministry of
education chairs the monthly meetings and leads the annual joint sector reviews. Additionally,
technical working groups, made up of MoE staff and representatives of development partners,
provide mechanisms for closely examining specific issues such as HIV/AIDS and teacher
education. At present, the Bank coordinates it activities with those of the Ministry and other
development partners by planning its missions to coincide with the annual sector reviews and
monthly Ministry/development partner meetings, and by maintaining close contact with other
development partners and the MoE through electronic communication. However, with the
planned opening of a Bank country office in Malawi in November 2006, the coordination of
the project’s activities with those of the other stakeholders in the education sector should
further get strengthened. The establishment of the Bank country office will also facilitate
Bank involvement in development partner dialogue with the government on important sector
issues such as financing the sector and supply, deployment and development of teachers.

29

6. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
6.1 Recurrent Costs

6.1.1 The recurrent costs generated by the project are relatively small. This is because the
schools to be supported through the project already exist and that the major recurrent cost,
teachers’ salaries, is already met by the government. In situations where the additional
classrooms provided by the project lead to increased number of classes (for example schools
maintaining some old buildings and splitting classes to reduce overcrowding in classrooms)
there will be no need for recruiting additional teachers. This is because at the secondary level,
as pointed out in paragraph 2.3.4, the current pupil to teacher ratio is 20:1, which is lower than
the MoE recommended ratio of 40:1. This oversupply of teachers at the secondary level is
principally due to the presence of a large number of teachers trained for the primary level
teaching at the CDSSs. The ESP indicates that about 1,000 of these teachers could be
redeployed without disrupting teaching in the secondary schools. But the MoE has not put in
place yet a mechanism for effecting the redeployment.

6.1.2 Recurrent costs related to the maintenance of facilities constructed under the project
are estimated at 2% of the capital investment and will amount to about UA 200,000 per year.
The recurrent cost for science equipment and consumables provided by the project are
estimated to be UA 10,000 per year, based on 3% of purchase price. The latest figure for
recurrent expenditure for secondary education (2004) was about UA 12 million. The total
addition to the recurrent expenditure arising from the project is UA 210,000 and this will
increase the recurrent expenditure of secondary education by about 1.7%. Modest increases
in recurrent expenditure for the sub sector should offset this small increase in the recurrent
expenditure resulting from the project activities. One third of this cost can also be met from
the school development funds as explained in the next paragraph.

6.2 Project Sustainability

6.2.1 The sustainability of project outcomes is primarily contingent on the level of
ownership by the country. This project supports specific components of the ESP. And the ESP
is a national program developed by the MoE through an extensive participation involving all
stakeholders in the education sector, whose involvement will continue during implementation
and in the monitoring and evaluation of the program. In designing the ESP, some mechanisms
for addressing sustainability issues have been included. For example, to ensure that
infrastructure provided to the schools lasts long, the ESP requires schools to use some of their
school development funds on maintenance of school buildings. In addition to contributions
from their communities, schools keep MKW 1,050 of school fees per child per year towards
their school development funds. Assuming an average enrolment of 300 students per school,
each of the 30 schools supported by the project can keep MKW 315,000 (equivalent to US$
2,625) of the school fees per year for maintenance and additional physical facilities. Since the
project is providing these schools a substantial proportion of the required infrastructure, a
higher proportion of the development fund can be used to meet the maintenance costs of the
facilities. In the case of textbooks, schools will receive an initial stock of textbooks. But
further financing of books, will have to come from the TRF of each school as described in
paragraph 3.1.6. The TRF is resourced from contributions paid by students, but its functioning
needs improvement at some schools. The project will provide resources for the review of
secondary education, and this will include examination of the strategies for the maintenance
of physical facilities and the provision of instructional materials.

30

6.2.2 The development of ESP should also facilitate the accessing of resources from the
FTI. Countries with credible sector development plans along with clear strategies for poverty
reduction are eligible for resources available under the FTI. The MGDS, which articulates
Malawi’s strategy for poverty reduction for the period 2006 — 2011 is in place, and once the
ESP is finalized there are opportunities for the sector to benefit from the resources available
under the FTI. However, the values of some of Malawi’s education sector indicators need to
be raised to meet those of the FTI indicative framework. For example, the share of
government expenditure on education, which is currently 17%, should be raised to the FTI
indicative framework’s value of 20%. The renewed commitment on the part of the
government to supporting education, as evidenced by the national conference on education
convened by the government in 2005, with participation of the highest authorities in
government and all levels of the society, should create a favorable environment for increased
investment in education.

6.3 Critical Risks and Mitigating Measures

 

6.3.1 One of the risks associated with the project is the likelihood of continued inadequate
provision of qualified teachers. Currently most teachers at the CDSSs are under-qualified and
the capacity of these under-qualified teachers to maximize the usage of instructional materials
to be provided by the project is questionable. To mitigate the risk, there are ongoing and
planned in—service teacher training programs to upgrade the qualifications of the under—
qualified teachers serving at the secondary schools. Also, the facilities at three higher
education institutions are being expanded to increase the number of qualified teachers
produced by these institutions. But the Ministry should put in place mechanisms for ensuring
that the new graduates from these institutions are hired immediately after graduation. The
current practice of delayed hiring increases the risks of the new graduates getting other jobs
and the problem of shortage of qualified teachers remaining unresolved.

6.3.2 Inadequate use of the instructional materials provided under the project, resulting from
insufficient supervision and inspection by the head teachers and secondary school inspectors,
is also a risk that could reduce the impact of project inputs. Training that will be provided
under the project to head teachers and secondary school inspectors as well as teachers, should
assist in mitigating this risk.

6.3.3 The impact of HIV/AIDS continues to pose a major threat to the education sector. To
combat the problem of HIV/AIDS, the MoE formulated an HIV/AIDS strategic plan, which
details the mechanisms for addressing the pandemic. The provision of learning/teaching
materials on HIV/AIDS education and the inclusion of modules on HIV/AIDS education in
the training provided to teachers and head teachers under the project will complement the
activities funded under the Ministry’s HIV/AIDS strategic plan to reduce the impact of the
pandemic on the education sector.

6.3.4 Although one of the primary objectives of the ESP is to facilitate the efficient use of
available resources, the declining proportion of government recurrent expenditure for the
sector for the last two years is of concern. In 2004, the recurrent expenditure on education as a
percent total government spending was 17%, down from 18% in 2003, and in 2005 the
recurrent government budget for the sector was 14% of total government recurrent spending.
In this project, about 16% of the cost of the construction works at the schools supported by
the project is planned to be met from the government counterpart contribution to the cost of

31

the project. But the availability of counterpart funds for the ongoing project has been a
problem and there is a risk that slow and inadequate provision of counterpart funds may affect
timely completion of project activities. The government indicated that it will meet its
obligations to providing the required counterpart funds. However, in the light of decreasing
recurrent budget for education, ADF along with other development partners supportive of
education should maintain a dialogue with the government to mitigate the risk of planned
activities under the ESP under—resourced.

7. PROJECT BENEFITS

7.1 Socio—economic Impact

7.1.1 The country’s economy is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and is heavily
reliant on the export of tobacco. But the high density of population in Malawi has increased
the pressure on the limited natural resources available and the country suffers from a number
of environmental problems, including soil erosion, deforestation, and water resources
depletion, which are major constraints to the expansion of the agriculture sector. Productivity
in agriculture, the country’s main economic activity, is therefore low. As a result, the majority
of the population, which is engaged in agriculture, does not generate sufficient income to lead
a productive life. Poverty is, therefore, widespread in the country. If Malawi is to move from
this reliance on one economic sector, diversify its economy and increase overall level of
economic productivity, investments in the development of human resources is paramount as
healthy and educated population is key to improved economic productivity and better living
conditions. By contributing to the implementation of the ten—year ESP, which is a major step
in Malawi’s human resources development, the project, through its support for improvements
in the quality of secondary education and especially in science education, will assist in the
building of middle level skills in the country, which is needed for promoting sustained
economic growth. At the household level, the increased individual productivity, resulting
from the improved quality of education, can lead to increased earnings and improved quality
of life.

Poverty Reduction

7.1.2 As pointed out above, poverty is widespread in Malawi with some 65% of the
population living below the poverty line. The non—income measures of poverty also point to
pervasive poverty in the country. For example, in 2005, infant and under—five mortality rates
were amongst the highest on the continent at 106 and 174 deaths per 1,000 births respectively
and maternal mortality rate was estimated at 1,120 deaths per 100,000 live births. Life
expectancy has in the past few years declined from 40 years in 1998 to 38 years in 2004,
largely as a result of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The UNDP’s 2005 Human
Development Report (HDR) ranks Malawi 165 out of 177 countries. The government believes
that this problem can be addressed in the context of a broad policy framework, which includes
investments in human resources through education and training, especially in rural areas
where the poor are concentrated. The CDSSs that the project will assist are predominantly
located in poor, remote rural areas. By assisting in the improvement of these schools through
the provision of physical facilities, provision of instructional materials, training of the school
teachers and school managers, the project will contribute to the improvement of the quality of
secondary education, which includes in Malawi the last two years of basic education. The
expected outcome of these activities is improved opportunity of schooling for poor children

32

and enhanced labor productivity with consequential rise in household incomes and a reduction
in poverty. The civil works component of the project will also benefit the local communities
by creating temporary jobs.

Gender

7.1.3 In Malawi, education attainment is lower among women compared to men. This is
illustrated by the higher adult illiteracy rate among women, which stood at 48% in 2005,
compared to 23% for men. By supporting improvement of the quality of education provided
by schools close in proximity to where students live, the project will contribute to improving
learning conditions for female students. This is because parents are more likely to allow girls
to attend school when the distance to travel is relatively short. At most CDSSs, because of the
poor quality of the education provided, students at the upper grades of secondary in these
schools generally walk to distant CSSs, where teaching conditions are better. But parents are
less likely to allow girls to walk these distances, and this reduces girl’s access to better
education. By improving conditions for learning at the CDSSs, the project will enhance
opportunities for better secondary education for girls. In addition, under the project’s support
for teacher education, preference will be given to female teachers in the upgrading of the
qualifications of under qualified CDSS teachers. This should have a positive impact on the
education of girls as the presence of female teachers at schools is positively related to girls’
continuation at schools. The training that will be provided to CD88 head teachers will also
include a module which aims to sensitize school managers to girls’ needs in the classroom and
the school. Additionally, the review of post—primary education that will be supported will
include an examination of the gender issue that impact on the education of girls.

HIV/AIDS

7.1.4 To complement the activities carried out under the MoE’s HIV/AIDS strategic plan,
the project will provide textbooks and teacher’s guides on life skills education, a core school
subject and an important area in HIV/AIDS education. The training provided to CD88 school
teachers under the project will also include HIV/AIDS education. Furthermore, the
management training program for CD88 head teachers will include a module that deals with
HIV/AIDS issues in education.

8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8. 1 Conclusions

8.1 To address the inadequate provision of educational services in the country, the
government of Malawi, together with its development partners, formulated a policy and
investment framework, which outlines the policies and strategies for the development of the
education sector, and also developed an education sector plan that translates the priorities in
the policy and investment framework into an implementation plan. The project will support
these policies and strategies by contributing to specific components of the sector plan aimed
at the improvement of the quality of secondary education provided, especially at the
community day secondary schools. It will provide resources for the improvement of the
physical facilities at some community day secondary schools, for the provision of
teaching/learning materials for community day secondary schools country wide, for the
training of under-qualified community day secondary teachers, and for the strengthening of
the capacity for school management and policy development for secondary education.

ANNEX VI
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN SUMMARY

Project Title: Support to Secondary Education (Education V) Project
Project N o.: P-MW-IAC-001 Country: Malawi
Department: ON SD Division: ON SD. 1

a) Brief description of the project and key environmental and social components
0 New construction at 30 CDSS Schools on existing sites;
0 Provision of science equipment and books for secondary schools;
0 In-service training for math and science teachers, training for school
managers and school inspectors;
0 Technical Assistance on Policy Development for ICT and Review of Post
Primary Education.

b) Major environmental and social impacts
Positive Impacts:
0 Improved safe water drinking supply to community day secondary
schools;
0 Improved sanitation facilities through the provision of ventilated latrines;
0 Reduced incidence of water borne diseases like cholera, gastro—intestinal
disorders;
0 Better opportunity for girls to attend schools; and
0 Protection of forest resources by utilization of stabilized blocks instead of
burned clay bricks.

Potential Negative Impacts
0 Risk of soil disturbance during construction; and
o Slight risk of pollution of groundwater and soil contamination.
o Risks of pollution and accidents from laboratory wastes

c) Enhancement and mitigation program

Implementation of the ESMP will be developed, along with the project
implementation document, by the project management team and cleared by the Bank
before commencement of project physical implementation. The following mitigation
measures represent the main outlines of the EMSP and will form an integral part of
the project;

0 Disturbance of soil is minimal since the scope of construction is limited to
small buildings within existing school premises;

0 To avoid the contamination of water resources, the water points will be
designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure proper drainage so as
to prevent water stagnation which may increase the risk of groundwater
contamination and development of breeding grounds for mosquitoes, ﬂies
and other insects;

0 Each school will be provided with VIP latrines for both students and
teachers to ensure an acceptable level of cleanliness and hygiene;

0 Efforts will be made to train and sensitize teachers, school managers and
students on environmental health hazards associated with infected water
and poor drainage;

0 Existing trees on all school sites will be preserved and students will be
sensitized on the importance of tree planting and protection.

0 Develop safety manual to minimize safety risks and pollution from
laboratory.

d) Monitoring program and complementary initiatives

0 The District Education offices will lead the environmental monitoring
activities and will provide regular reporting to project management and
the MoE; and

0 Bank supervision missions will follow up on the implementation of the
EMSP.

e) Institutional arrangements and capacity building requirements
0 The overall responsibility for the implementation of the project ESMP
will rest with the MoE. In addition, environmental education is
provided by the schools as part of the regular curriculum.
0 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will supervise the
implementation of the ESMP

f) Public consultations and disclosure requirements
0 The project is designed to operate in a participatory manner where all
activities will be implemented in close collaboration with local
communities to increase their sense of ownership of the improved
facilities to be introduced under the project.

g) Estimated costs: Project environmental components
0 The main environmental improvement falls under the civil works for
construction of CD88 schools with a budget of UA 10.02 million.
0 Notably, waste management will be improved through the provision of
pits and VIP latrines as part of the facilities at the CD88 schools.

h) Implementation schedule and reporting
0 The environmental management and monitoring will be implemented
following the same project schedule as all activities were
mainstreamed in the project design. Achievements and problems will
be reported in the project quarterly progress reports and should be
timely addressed by the project management and the Bank.
