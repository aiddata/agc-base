1 1th December, 2008

Dear Mr. Kumbatira,

I am writing in relation to the amended “Malawi Civil Society Networks Capacity
Development” proposal submitted to the Embassy of lreland by the Malawi Economic
Justice Network. I am pleased to inform you that following our internal review that
additional funding has been approved to the original agreement (f Ref: l\/l.l§3.lN 07 (l 1).

While the terms and conditions of the amended grant are outlined in the detailed Grant:
Agreement attached to this letter, i also wanted to draw your attention to the ftjiilmzving:

l. The additional funding is being provided based on amendments to the original 2 year
proposal agreed between lrish Aid and MEI N. The amended grant attreement attached to
this letter will therefore supersede the grant agreement signed by lrish Aid on the 4th
September 2007 (Ref: MEJN 07' Ol).

  

2. The proposal submitted was in excess of the amount of available funding at this time.
Unfortunately, lrish Aid is therefore, not in a position to fund all of the proposed
additional activities. Based on our internal review, and following extensive consultation
with MEJN and the other networks, we are in a position to only cover the costs as
outlined in the budget attached to this letter and grant agreement. This version of the
budget should be revised in line with this agreement and will be the point of reference
from here on. The version submitted with the proposal on 24m October 2008 is therefore
obsolete. It is the responsibility QfMEJN as signatory to the agreement to ensure that
this information is communicated clearly to all partners concerned.

3. The grant allocation of E 118,597 will be made payable in Malawi Kwacha at the
prevailing exchange rate on the day of transfer.

4. Irish Aid expects both ﬁnancial and narrative progress reports (standard iormats for each
will be shared with you in advance) to be submitted according to the folltnving schedule:

0 Progress Report (Narrative and Financial) by February 15”] 200.9

- Interim Financial Progress Report by May 15m  2009

0 Progress Report (Narrative and Financial) by August 15m 2009

- Final report (Narrative and Financial)  by J an nary 3 l SI 2 0 l (l

0 Copies of all research reports, advocacy materials, policy paper; and other
relevant documentation related to this cooperation should also be attached to
reports submitted to lrish Aid.

10.

Irish Aid in consultation with h/lE.l'N and the other networks may organise monitoring
visits in between reporting dates to assess progress against the worl; plan and review
documentation in relation to the project (ﬁnancial reports, outputs etcl.

While the funding will be transferred to MEJN upon signing of the (Ilrant A greement, it is
also a requirement that: a detailed log frame and skills develrnmzent plan outlining the
proposed activities for each network is submitted to Irish Aid via h/l'ElN.

In relation to CSCQBE, Irish Aid approves disbursement offending held back in 2 ()0 ,7-
2008 and that relevant expenditures can be backdatetl to I“ September 2008 against
this grant The additional funding for 2008 —» 2009 should not however  disbursed until
fulﬁlment of the applicable conditions outlined in point 6, i.e. submission of a log frame
for proposed activities in 2008-2009.

The additionalfunding to MHENshould not be disbursed until such time as the issues
in relation to misappropriation of funding by the Financial Administrator are resolved
to the satisfaction of lWHEN, MEJN and Irish Aid It is also advised that MHEN
postpone any of the additional programme activities under the revised proposal until
the proposed systems audit or other similar activities are completed aml shared with
donors.

Irish Aid would like to stress the importance of sound ﬁnancial and programme
monitoring and management for all beneficiaries of this grant and the important role that
MEJN as signatory to the agreement has to play in terms of monitoring all partners and
ensuring that budgets are followed and that reporting requirements are met.

In incidences where a budget revision may he required then this should he put to Irish Aid
in writing and can only be implemented following the formal written approval of Irish
Aid. Only Irish Aid is entitled to approve a revision to the project documentation
supporting the agreement attached to this letter.

Please ﬁnd enclosed 2 copies of the Grant Agreement  negotiated which will need to he
signed and one copy returned here to the Embassy. Once we have received the signed Grant
Agreement and a formal request for transfer offunding, a payment ole) l l8,597 will be made
to the MEJN bank account for which details have been provided.

I look forward to taking this worthwhile project to implementation and working closely with
the Malawi Economic Justice Network in this regard.

Yours Sincerely,
