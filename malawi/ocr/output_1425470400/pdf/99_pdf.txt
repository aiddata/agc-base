Dear Ms. Auer,

RE: 2009/2010 Accelerating Child Survival through Improving Nutrition

I wish to inform you that approval has been given for a grant of € 1,060,249.29
between November 2009 and November 2010 from Irish Aid (hereinafter, also
referred to as the ‘Department’) towards the above programmes.

This contribution is being made subject to the following terms, hereinafter referred to
as the “Agreement”:

I) The programme activities will encompass the 2009/2010 Accelerating Child
Survival through Improving Nutrition as outlined in the proposal document
attached to this agreement.

2) UNICEF will monitor the project activities and will:

- carry out the programme in a proper manner and ensure that all personnel
engaged on the programme have the appropriate skills and professional
competence.

- make every endeavour to ensure that all applicable laws, statutes and
regulations are complied with, in the course of implementing the programme.

- notify any changes to the programme or to the manner in which the
contribution is to be applied, must be agreed in writing in advance with the
Department.

3)

4)

6)

7)

8)

9)

Should an audit report of the External Auditors of UNICEF contain observations
relevant to the contribution, a copy of such report and of UNICEF’s published
comments shall be made available to the donor.

UNICEF will procure and dispose of supplies, equipment and services using
UNICEF Rules and Regulations.

Neither Ireland (“the State”), the Minister or the Department shall have or be
deemed to have any liability in relation to any contracts or agreements negotiated
or entered into by UNICEF or any other party in connection with the project.
Neither the State, the Minister nor the Department is or shall be deemed for any
purpose to be a partner of UNICEF.

No contractual or other relationship shall exist or be deemed to exist between the
State, the Minister of the Department and any other person employed, or sent
abroad in connection with, or otherwise associated with, or working on the
programme. None of the personnel working or who shall work on the project are,
nor shall be deemed to be, employees or agents of the State, the Minister or the
Department.

(1) Although the Minster is providing a financial contribution towards the cost of
the programme, neither the State, the Minister or the Department shall bear any
liability for claim of whatever nature or for any court order made against UNICEF
or any party, arising from, or in connection with the programme and UNICEF will
be responsible for any liabilities, claims, actions or proceedings whatsoever in
connection with the programme.

(2) In particular and without prejudice to sub-paragraph (l), neither the State, the
Minister or the Department shall be liable in respect of any claim by or on behalf
of any advisor, manager, volunteer, expert, employee, servant or agent of
UNICEF or by or on behalf of any other person who may have a claim against
UNICEF arising out of the implementation of the programme and nor shall the
State, the Minister or the Department be liable in respect of any claims that may
arise where any advisor, manager, volunteer, expert, employee, servant or agent of
UNICEF or any other person, is injured, disabled or killed in the course of
employment or engagement under the programme.

It shall be the sole responsibility of UNICEF to take adequate and appropriate
insurance cover in relation to the programme.

The Government of Ireland may conduct an evaluation on the activities ﬁnanced
out of its contribution. The terms of reference for such an evaluation will be
mutually agreed.

This agreement will be deemed to be frustrated if:

a) Unless otherwise agreed with the Department, the programme for any reason
is not commenced within three months Of the signature by UNICEF of this
agreement; or

The Minister in consultation with UNICEF considers that the events occur
which are sufﬁcient to defeat or substantially prevent or delay the achievement
of the stated objectives of the programme.

b)

UNICEF will be given advance notice by the Department in the event that the
Agreement is deemed to be frustrated and will be given an opportunity to
respond to the Department’s concerns before the Agreement is formally
terminated.

10) UNICEF agrees to refund to the Department, within six months of the completion
of the project (as per this agreement), any part of the contribution which has not
been allocated.

a) UNICEF agrees to refund to the Department any monies advanced by the
Department which have not been accounted for in the project to the
satisfaction of the Department.

b) Alternatively, it may be agreed, by consultation with the Department, to use
the residual funds in support of activities which reﬂect the overall objectives
of the original allocation.

ll) UNICEF will acknowledge receipt of the contribution provided by Irish Aid to the
Department within 20 days of receipt of such and also in publicity about the
programme in a manner to be agreed with the Department and in accordance with
the applicable UN/UNICEF rules and regulations.

12) The Department reserves the right to reduce its contribution, stop transfers
prematurely or claim repayment of all or part of the funds transferred, amongst
others, if contractual obligations are not met or if it emerges that the funds are not
being used or have not been used for the purposes for which they have been made
available. The Department will initiate such reduction or termination only after
consultation with UNICEF, after which the accounts will be settled on the basis of
costs made and taking into account, within reasonable limits, ﬁnancial obligations
already entered into, in good faith, by UNICEF in the implementation of the
prOj ect.

l3) UNICEF and the Department shall seek to settle amicably any differences and
disputes arising from or relating to the implementation of the programme.

14) This Agreement may not be amended, varied or modified in any way except by an
instrument in writing signed by both parties.
