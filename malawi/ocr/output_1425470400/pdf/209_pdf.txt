1. RATIONALE

1.1. Economic and social situation

Malawi has a pc-piiiritn'vn of approximatcl} 12.3 million of uhicli 52.4 percent lt\C below the poverty
line'. It continues to rank loo out of l”? countries on the 3006 Human Development Index with 8 GDP
per capita ol‘ L'SS lo: \lalaw cmers an area of l 18 500 km: and is one ofthe most densely populated
countries in sub-Saharan Africa with an awragc land holding ol‘t).8 ot'a hectare per household.

Agriculture is not only the backbone of Malawi's econom) bUt also an essential part of its economic
base and social labric. accounting for about 36% ol‘GDP; 90% of foreign exchange eaming (tobacco
65%, sugar I l9’o and tea l0%) and employing 87% ot' the population}. Generally agricultural
productivity is low, primaril) due to dependence on rain—fed agriculture. declining soil fertility, and a
lack of inputs. The majority of smallltolders practice subsistence agriculture rather than considering
farming as a bUSlI’ICbS. The status quo is exacerbated h) weak links to markets and limited aCCess to
extension services. land and credit.

H0wevcr large maize surpluses in the past two years. due to favourable rains and the Gobi/donor input
subsidy scheme. have helped raise real GDP from 3.1% to 8.5% between 2005 and 1006. In addition, a
sound macro economic situation has seen inﬂation decrease from l6.5% to 9.9% between 2005 and
2006, similarly interest rates hate fallen from 45% to 20% between 2003 and 2006. In 2007 the EIB has
made available 6' 30 million for an imestment facility for tan—loaning> to small and medium-sized
businesses. These improsements in the macro economic situation are expected to base a positive impact
on private sector investment. And lastly. in 2006, Malawi also achieved HlPC completion.

Despite the encouraging macro economic situation. poverty in Malawi continues to be endemic,
particularly in rural areas. and food security is far from assured. l iwlihoods are brittle with few coping
mechanisms or assets to mitigate the impacts of an) exogenous shocks. The Situation is further
compounded by malnutrition, and high lll\""AlDS and malaria infection rates. Furthermore. Malawi‘s
environment continues to be degraded. Chen that more than 8992; of households depend on income
derived. wholly or in pan. from the exploitation ot'thc natural resource base ' be it through farming.
fishing or other aciit ities — this degradation implies negatite consequences on future household incomes
unless it is addressed

1.2. Sector context
Malawi '3 development and sugar policies

Malawi's oxerarching policy document is the Malawi Growth and Detelopment Strategy (MGDS), a
second generation PRSP which was adopted in 2006. It has a ver} high level of national ownership and
commitment. The MODS highlights sugar as one of three core sub sectors in terms of revenue, GDP.
employment and foreign exchange earnings and looks to maximise the performance of the sugar sector
in the short to medium term. The MODS recognises sugar's imponance not only in terms ofagricultural
production, but also in agro processsing. and identiﬁes sugar as a means of reducing Malawi‘s
dependency on tobacco. which represented approximately 58.2% of Malawi‘s exports in 2002 compared
to 7.7 "/o for sugar

In response to the changes in the current sugar regime announced by the European Commission in June
2005, Malawi developed a National Adaptation Strategy (NAS). The overarching objectives of the
National Adaptation Strategy (NASJ are twofold"

a) To increase cane production and factor} output (quantitative objective)

b) To increase production through efﬁciencs gains in both the ﬁeld and factory operations
(qualitative objective).

The EC has dcieloped 21 Multi Annual Support Strategy for Maitmi 2006-205 in order to support.
where appropriate and possible. the measures outlined in the \AS. The EC Multi Annual Support
Strategy for Malaixi is in turn operationalised through two Multi Annual Indicatiic Programmes (MlPs)
which ensure coordination and programming of the Annual Action Programmes tAAPs). The recently
adopted MIP For 2007-20“) has mu main objectiies. which are'

3) Strengthening and dmeloping out grrmers’ schemes
b) Support for rural infrastructure deielopment

The AAP 200". is the second in a series of annual actions and builds on aCliHUCS already approved in
the 2006 Accompanying Measures.

The strengths and weakness ufrhe sugar secmr

Sugar is the second highest foreign exchange earlier in \lalavii at around ll‘t'ii; it contributes 5-694: of
GDP; l‘?-"o to goiermncnt reienues. employs H.500 workers directl) and supports around l20.000
people indirectly

Malawi is considered a potential mirld«class producer of sugar mth excellent cane growing conditions
and abundant water and land resources. Malaisi‘s industry is one of the most efﬁcient in the world. This
is in spite of the fact that some of Malaiii‘s comparative advantage is eroded by the fact that it is
landlocked. with transport adding an extra 3-4 cents per lb to the farm gate price of 7 cents per lb.
Nevertheless, Malaixi remains luv. cost and proﬁtable at current “Ol’id prices. Malaiii also has a
reputation for high qualit} sugar and is known for its specialit) sugars. Furthermore, the Nchalo mill is
fair trade certiﬁed

Malawi beneﬁts from numerous markets for its sugar. L'nlike man) other sugar protocol countries,
Malawi is not hlgi‘li) dependent on the ESL market. to \shich it onl) exports around 36%. meaning that it
is less exposed to the elimination of preferential prices under the sugar reform, At present the majority —
57% w is for domestic consumption. A further l9% is exported to the regional market — mainly Kenya
and 'l‘anunia ~- silio despite being sugar producers are net importers of sugar.

There is a high degree of consensus that the reform of the El; sugar regime presents Malawi — like
neighbouring Zambia -- with very signiﬁcant opportunities to increase their sugar exports to the EL'
under the Everything But Arms (EBA) agreement. The expansron ofthe sugar sector in Malawi, which
often links the prii ate sector with out growers. can be used as a model for achieving pm erty alleviation
by linking trade to deielotamcttt. in addition. there is the potential of further increasing the use of sugar
byproducts. for example. in the production ot‘ ethanol. While a regional study has been conduclcd by
the EC last )ear. the 2006 Accompanying measures will be used to launch a stud) speciﬁcally for
Malawi.

Potential in the sect0r is compromised by a number of factors. Sugar needs to be grown under irrigation
in Malawi, meaning that any expanSion is capitai intensive with high initial imestments. Past interest
rates over 40% and the heavy devaluation of the Kwacha has meant that commercial loans have been
cosdy. This, coupled with the lack of availability ot‘sot‘t loans. has limited imcstment and expansion of
the sector and in certain cases. such as Kasinthula, led to the accumulation of signiﬁcant debts. In
addition, limited access to credit at indiiidual and cooperative ieiel has hindered access to inputs and
funds fur replanting cane. both Wthh have negatively impacted on productivity This is exacerbated by
a lack of skilled personnel both at ﬁeld and management leiel. And lastly. from a deielopment
perspective. out grower schemes have high per capita costs given the limited number of direct
beneﬁciaries.

Threats to the sector are less tangible. but exist netertheless. Clearly government macro-economic
policy towards the sector is important. In addition. the dominance ol‘ Illmo in the Malawian sugar
sector, which omts both mills. creates dependency on a singlc company. World prices Ior sugar have
proved to be highly volatile and difﬁcult to predict. due to the fact that sugar is largely traded through
futures and trade acrccmcnts. although there is consensus that in the short to medium term prices would
rise to around ‘2 5 cents per lb And lastly. thch is a need for transparency and accountability between the
various stakeholders in the sector in order to avoid misunderstanding and the perception that out
growers are being exploited.

Recent developments

In September 2006 Illmo was purchased by Associated British Foods. Due to this. and their conﬁdence
in the opportunities opened up by hat ing unlimited access to the II market. Illmo hats brought forward
their post-2012 expansion plans in urdcr that they he completed by it’ll l or earlier. The plans include
investing around (- 60 million in increasing the crushing capacity of the \chalo factory front 3l3 MT
per hour to 385 Ml. increasing the amount of raw cane required from I414 million tonnes to 1.754
million tons. I‘his increased demand ol‘ 340.000 MI 0!“ cane requires that a further 3.300 hectares of
land be CUI‘HCFICd to sugar cane. It is expected that 700 hectares will come from estates while the
remaining 2.600 hectares will be from put groyser schemes. such as the 550 hectare Kasinthula phase III
expansion. ()ycr the next ten years Illmo has further plans to expand the capacity of the Nchalo mill
creating the demand for an additional 7.000 hectares. \h hile user the next 3-5 years increased capacity at
Dwangwa will require an additional 2.500 hectares ol‘sugar cane,

1.3. Lessons learnt and complementarity

The Kasinthula Sugar Cane (Jrcmers‘ Scheme (KSCGS) is an irrigated smallholder sugar cane scheme
supplying cane for processing by Illmo at the Nchalo mill in the Chilmawa district of Malawi. The
scheme was established in I997 using a bridging loan in anticipation ol'concessionary ﬁnance. However
the concessionary ﬁnance was delayed resulting in the scheme accumulating significant debt that almost
doubled the original cost of the scheme. The scheme “as eventual ﬁnanced through the European
Investment Bank, the (joxernment of Malawi. and lllmo Group Holdings London Ltd but has been
severely allected by the continuous detaluation ol‘the Malawi Kuacha

These loans were guaranteed by Ilium on behalfthc out growers. Hassex er. out grewers incomes3 have
not always been sufﬁcient to sen ice the loans. Instead the loans hate been serviced by lllovo who have
set up a type of ‘oxcrdrat't t'acility‘ for the out growers. The design ot'thc present operation has taken on
board lessons learnt under phase I and phase II expansion of the Kasinthula out growers“ scheme as well
as the recommendations ot‘an L’Mc‘lht\¢ GoN'I. I1Cstudy on the feasibility oi'thc phase III expansion.

As it currently stands. the Kasinthula scheme is unproﬁtable and unsustainable The scenario does not,
at ﬁrst glance. look encouraging. However. if loan repayments are excluded, the accounts ofthe scheme
from 200l onwards demonstrate pre-taa proﬁts ot‘mer 3l°"o. In addition. even in its current state the
scheme provides signiﬁcant social and economic beneﬁts to the region. which is one of the poorest and
most food insecure in Malavii.

Given Malaw‘s comparative advantage for sugar production, the st heme's prov-en underlying economic
viability, the guaranteed aCcess to market that out growers hate through Illoso. and stakeholders'
commitment to the scheme. a phase III expansion is proposed in order to make the whole scheme viable.
Phase Ill is based on an extensive study and would increase the land area under cane by a further 550
hectares. If the expansion is funded wholly, or in part. from a grant then not only would the expansion
increase cane revenues — as well as sharing ﬁxed costs . but the existing debt burden would be shared
among a greater number of beneﬁciaries meaning that it is both more manageable and repaid sooner. In

addition, in the past technical assistance to the scheme had been charged as 6% ot’ the Kasinthula‘s share
ofthe cane revenues under the l)i\ ision ot' Proceeds”. As technical assistance would non be provided to
Dwangwa and Kasinthula tinder acti‘. ities I and 3 ofthe 2007 Accompanying Measures. 3 further 6% is
made available tor debt repayment.

It is expected'1 that il‘the phase III expansion is grant t‘unded. then it is expected to break even from the
second year and the u hole scheme by 20l2. Farther incomes are expected to average 5650 per farmer
until phase I and Il debts are repaid in 20l6 after which the} rise to over SLSOO. in addition, it is
proposed that farmers pay 2% of their resenucs into a community dexclopment fund. which by 2025 is
estimated to exceed $6 million The community development Fund would be used to mitigate any
negative effects of the expansion and fund community projects (schools. prm-ision of clean water,
HIV/AIDS projects ete.t and so help ensure that the scheme has a wider beneﬁciary hasc that those
directly employed.

Recent experiences have shown that the Board of Trustees ot‘ the Shire Valley Cane Growers Trust
('SVCGT), which mer‘sees the Kasinthula scheme. must be strengthened. In addition the l'rust must have
full time qualiﬁed stat‘l‘ accountants and programme management stat‘l‘. which mil be assisted by
technical assistance (activities 1 and I). -’\ study \‘tll be launched under the 3006 Accompanying
Measures to look into the capacity ot’the Kasinthula and Duangua Board ot'l‘rustees. the latter appears
to operate more efﬁciently.

The expansion at phase ii! utilising donor funds and the establishment of the community development
fund can proxide an innovative model of development that could be replicated across Malawi and
developed for other cash crops. The model promotes a busmess approach to development and
demonstrates how business can help develop a communit} and reduce pmerty though maximising
market opportunities and Malawi is comparative advantage in sugar production.

Other lessons can be drawn from the implementation of STABEX projects, which hate mainly focused
on the tea and cotl'ee sectors. EC support has assisted in increasing the proﬁtability of both smallholders
and estates by introducing higher yielding and better quality varieties In turn. this has helped to increase
diversiﬁcation by sinallholders. leading to higher production and increased incomes in these areas.

Actions under the AAP 2007 are fully consistent with, and complementary to. the 9th EDF Country
Strategy Paper (CSP). where both agriculture and infrastructure are focal areas‘. in addition. in recent
years Malani has been the third largest rootpient of Food SCCUFI?) Budget Line Funds. It is expected that
the 10th EDF will maintain the same focus but add food security to agriculture under focal area one of
the IOIh EDl CSP L'nder the lOth tEDF a greater percentage of resources will be allocated to the focal
areas Over non-tocal areas. It is theret'ore highly probably that EDl’ resources will be used for
complementary actions for sugar in Malawi.

The EC is the largest donor in the agricultural sector in Malawi and has a number of Hell performing

2. DESCRIPTION

The 2007 Sugar Action Plan is the second in a series ot‘annual actions to support the implementation of
the Multi Annual Indicative Programme DOW—2010. the EC Support Strategy for Malawi 2006—2013.
and the Natmnal .-\daptation Strategy For \‘lalam WAS). it builds on activities approved in the 2006
Accompanying Measures.

For ease of reference an initial logical t'ramcisork is attached. 11 mar) be updated or adapted in the
Overall Work Plan. to which it \A ill be annexed. Without this necessarily requiring an amendment to the
ﬁnancing agreement.

2.1. Objectives
Overall objective

The overall objective is to reduce pox-en). The proiect purpose is to strengthen and develop sugar cane
out grower schemes, leading to increased out grower incomes. through four actixitics. The first two
activities focus on capacity building at both farmer and at management level The third is a phase III
expansion ofthe Kasinthula out grower scheme. and the last is the Improvement of cane haulage /' feeder
maids in the Dwangvia out grower scheme Cross cutting issues are directly addressed in activities a, b
an c.

0) Capacity building for 0a! growers in agricultural met/lads (flm)

Building the capacit) of out growers in agricultural methods would lead to better )ields of sugar cane
from the out growers schemes. (‘urrcnt out growers in the Duungun and Kusinthula were not selected
due to their Farming abilities but rather on land claims. meaning farmers have dill'ering levels of
expertise. In addition. tcxs had c\pet'ietice of gaming sugar cane. \\hlcl1 requircs dillierent agricultural
practices to others crops. VS hile the main focus of the actitit} “ill be orientated towards increasing
sugar cane production tplanting. weeding. l'enilisers application. herbicide application. trashing, feeder
canal maintenance. drain maintenance etc.) in an cmirt‘nmcntall) sustainable manner. assistance will
also be gii en on best agricultural methods to grow other crops. as in Kitsinthula out growers are each
provided \sith dpptuxfmalcl) 0.4 hectares of irrigated land in order to gross other crops oftheir choice.
Training Will also be giien on cmironmental issues. gender issues. l|l\'iAll)S, and cmc education.

The actn it) \muld focus on pro\ iding technical assistance to all out groth’s at both the Duangwa and
Kasinthula schemes A needs assessment will be conducted in Order to design the modules and the
balance ot’assmtance between D\\ﬂng\\3 and Kasinthula. as it ell as the needs ot'cach out grower within
each scheme. lt is expected that the majority ol‘capacit} building will focus on Kasinthula. with phase
III farmers requiring the most assistance.

The actitit} “ill result in increased )ields. and hence incomes. of out growers. This mll help to reduce
poverty in the target areas and ensure the sustainability ofutit grower schemes.

b) Building of our growerx' management capabilities (61m)

Both Dwangua and Kasinthula hate similar institutional set ups “lthi! are based on the conventional
institutional models tor irrigated smallholder sugar cane projects. In the model (shown in annex 2)
individual out growers are represented by elected farmer on whom committees. These committees
receive technical assistance and training from Kasinthula or Dwangwa Cane Growers Company Ltd,
companies that run the do) -to-du_\ operations. which are in turn linked to a Trust. where out growers are
also represented The lrusts both represent and oversee the out growers schemes. they are the apex
bodies dealing mth pleilt.‘ sector tlllmo) and other stakeholders on behalf ot' the individual out
growers.

However, the various bodies which make up the institutional model have different capacities and hence
differing needs for capacrry building This actis it) will {oeus on impronng the ﬁnancial. administrative
and project management capacities ot‘ the Trusts. lhc respectixc Cant: Growers Companies. farmer
committees and the indi\ idual farmers themselves. this uill enable better decision making by the Trusts
and other bodies. for example, helping them to negotiate better credit facilities for inputs and replanting
materials. The action \xill also help establish a matinee information sistem tMlS) for decision
making and monitoring which will increase cfhcmncy of operations. Training mill also be g'vcn on

 

 

environmental issues. genderissues. HlV ME 5. and cnic education. The activity b) is comp-lem'cntaﬁr

to‘E‘éiiiiiiS'iiiTa-hiEh’ ‘t‘o‘cu gas on mt» prodtic‘ﬁoﬁ's‘i‘de'” 

 

A needs assessment will be conducted in order to design the modules and the balance of assistance
given between Dnangwa and Kasimhula. although it is thought that “the ma‘torit) cit-capacity building
will focus on the latter. A preliminary needs assessment coxering both aCllUUES a) and b) was
undertaken for Kasinthula as part of the studs on the thasibilit) ot‘a phase III expansion and IS included
in Annex 3.

c) Kasinlhula phase 3 expansion (0.55m)

The Kasinthula Sugar Cane Growers Scheme (KSCGS) is an irrigated smallholder sugar cane scheme
supplying cane for processing by lllO‘I'O at the Nchalo mill in the Chiltwawa district of Malawi. The
scheme was established in 1991' using a bridging loan in anticipation ol'concessionar) ﬁnance. However
the concessionar) finance was delayed resulting in the scheme accumulating Signiﬁcant debt that almost
doubled the original cost of the scheme. The scheme was eventual!) ﬁnanced through the European
Investment Bank. the Goremment of Malawi. and “lore Group Holdings London Ltd but has been

severely affected by the continuous detaluatiott of the Malani Knacha. This is discussed in greater
detail in section L3.

The cost ot‘ Kasinthula Phase lll expansion has been estimated at around 6 4 million. however, it is
assumed that t" 3 SS is sufﬁcient to complete the expansion due to a number of potential cost saving
measures. The expansion will be ﬁnanced through an EC grant ol'é' 2.55 million. lfadditional ﬁnancing
is needed. then this can potentially be obtained either through an [LIB loan or monies allocated in the
2008 AAP where. according to the MI? ZOOT-ZOlU. a further €39“ million is foreseen for the
development ol'cxisting and next out groxter schemes.

The phase lll expansion would increase the area under irrigated cane by a further 550 hectares. It would
involve an additional 200 out growers \\ hose incomes would be signiﬁcantly enhanced by admittance to
the scheme" in addition a further 2 'z .8 hectares of irrigated food crops would he gromi. enhancing food
security in \t hat is traditionally one oi~ the most t'ood insecure regions of Malawi. The expansion will
also ensure the Viability of phase I and phase ll. hereby securing existing farmers incomes. lt will also
capitalise the community detelopment fund. \xhieh will help to u iden the beneficiarx base.

d) Dwangwa feeder minis (€0.35m)

The casts of bane-sting. including the transportation ot. the cane from the ﬁeld to the lacrories. account
for approximater 40% of all operating costs of the out growers schemes. As operational costs are paid
for by the farmers from their 60% of the diiision of proceeds t‘DOP) with the mills, any reduction in
operating cost results in a direct increase in farmers net incomes. A signiﬁcant proportion of operating
costs are cane haulage costs. which are contracted out to private companies. These companies charge
high costs in part due to the poor state ol' the roads which are unsuitable for heaxy farming machinery
and cane haulage. improving the feeder roads in [)wangwa “ill potentially reduce the costs of hauling
the sugar cane to the rclinery. and hereby increase l‘arrners‘ net incomes. imprmements will focus on
cane haulage roads. bridges. drainage and ﬂood protection infrastructure.

2.2. Expected results

Section 1 .3 identified a number nt'strength and weaknesses ol'the sugar sector in Malawi, The weakness
that the four actixnies of the 2007' Accompanying Measures will address include 1) poor skilled
personnel at both ﬁeld and management lCVCl.’ 2) that expansion of irrigated sugar cane is capital
extensive and that Kasmthula scheme is currently unviablc 3) that proﬁts are eroded by poor
infrastructure in addition these actitities “ill build on Malani's strengths in the sector. The four
activities tad] mll result in the follow. ing results:

a) Capacity buildng for out growers in agricultural methods {Um}
alj Out grow era. are better skilled and more productixe compared with their lexel at the beginning
ot‘the activity
32) Existing out growers incomes increase as a result of being more productive
b) Building afoul growers ' management capabilities (61m)
bl) Out grower management representatives make better management decisions and operations
are run more eiiicrently‘ (credit facilities. etc.)

b2) Existing out growers' incomes increase due to the better management and more efﬁcient
operations.

4:) Kasr'nlhula phase 3 expansion (62.55114)
cl) Kasinthula will use 550 hectares of land for growing irrigated sugar cane.

The FCBSXhllll)‘ stud} estimated that sugar can: out growers earnings aieragc between H.500 lU H.500 MKW per month.
This compares taxourabte to the maturity of households in the region who earn between 2.000 to 4,000 MKW per month
Ho!) 2006 ligh‘l’tfxi

c2) Kasinthtila \xill produce an additional 65.000 \lT ot'cane each year.

CS) 200 additional sugar cane farmers are recruited under phase lll whose incomes are increased
from 3.000 MK to l 1.000 MK per month.

c4) Food security is imprm'ed as a result ot'gmwing an additional 2l.8 hectares of irrigated food
crops

c5) Deht servicing is itnprmed.

c6) The communit) dexelopnieiit t‘und widens the beneﬁciaries base it} generating 3 E million by
