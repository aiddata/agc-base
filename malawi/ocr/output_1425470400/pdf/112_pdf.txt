CAPACITY BUILDING FOR MIDDLE, LEVEL IVIA‘NAGERS Tli_Rtﬁ)l...ltCll-‘l   ' 
TRAINING AT BUNDA COLLEG OF A GRICUIITLI RE
Background

Malawi has one of the highest levels of child malnutrition, with a high percentage Ho‘i'itl o'l

 

children suffering from chronic malnutrition (NSC) and UNIC ti? 2003i. Stunting is one of" the
nutritional indictors that has shown no improvement over the last twenty years as indicated by
three consecutive Demographic and Health Surveys oi" l992, 2000 and 2004. Stunting is
frequently irreversible after the age of 2 years therefore it is necessary that interventions should
target the period before the children become stunted. Stunting is associated with pt‘ititr
developmental attainment in young children and poor school achievement or intelligence levels
in older children. Furthermore, growth retardation in early childhood is associated with
signiﬁcant functional impairment in adulthood, that is limited bit‘ilogical and intellectual abilities

that diminish their workng capacity and in women it leads to increased obstetrical risks.

There are several levels of intervention for nutrition in lvlalavvi which include capacity building,
of personnel responsible for coordinating, implementing food and nutrititim security policies and
plans at district level. District level ofﬁcers in health, agriculture. gender and child, devel<zz>pment
are increasingly involved in planning and overseeing the implementation of nutrition programs in
districts. Hence the department of Nutrition HIV and AIDS (UNI-M) plans to build capacity for
middle managers from key sectors in food and nutrition security through structured training.
This is necessary since some of the incumbent ofﬁcers involved in implementation of nutrition
programs do not have nutrition back ground training. Most of these ofﬁcers come from a general
agriculture background. Therefore through this activity it is expected that government’s capacity
to plan and oversee the implementation of nutrition programs in the country will be strengthened.
In addition non governmental organizations implementing nutrition programs will also be
included in the training. It is envisaged that 20% of all the participants to be trained in this
program will come from the civil society. This will enhance the existing partnership for

implementation at district level.

 

Bunda College of Agriculture

Bunda College of Agriculture  a constituent College ol‘the University oil" l‘vlulawi. It is the only
institution that provides full undergraduate  in Nutrition and Food Science and a master oil?”
science in Food Science and Human Nutrition in lvlalawi. The Critllege has a number of qualiﬁed
and experienced faculty members who will be involved in the delivery oi" these programs.
Currently Bunda College of Agriculture is the only institution offering university training in the
area of human nutrition. More that 80% of current qualified nutrition practitioners in the country
have been trained at Bunda College oi" Agriculture. ln addition the college has in the past olf‘lie'red
tailor made short courses to meet the needs ol‘ the nutrition sector sttzilte holders such  non
governmental organisations and government. The short term trainings (Tillie-red addressed issues
of infant young child feeding; food processing and nutrition assessment. among other issues. The
college is also involved in training oi" ofﬁcers from government. government: pttltitﬁﬂ'lfl and non
governmental organisations implementing nutrition interventions with support trom the .liiiuropean
Union. The training focuses on nutrition impact and output indicators as part of the harmonized
monitoring and evaluation of projects and programs in hilalawi. "'l"‘ii'is: training has become
necessary because most of the incumbent ofﬁcers responsible for nutrititm at district levels do not
have any nutrition training and yet they are required to collect data on nutrition indicators.
Hence the need for this training. This training is being ccmducted crituntrywide and is ctjtt':)rdinated
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security Technical (EU l‘ttnded projects} secrctzztriat
which is responsible for monitoring and evaluation of nutrition output. and impact indicators

among other indicators.

Focus of planned support

This activity is in line with strategic objective three ol‘the National Nutrititm Policy and Strategic
Plan (NNPSP), which clearly outlines the capacity gaps and needs for the nutrition sector in
Malawi. Through this activity Bunda College of Agriculture seeks ﬁnancial support to contribute
towards strengthening the capacity of government institutions to implement nutrition activities

and projects.

The role of Bunda College of Agriculture in this proposed program will be  tolltznws:

- ln liason with OPC-DNHA the College will develop course material to meet the ltntwvledge
and skills gaps for middle level managers, According to the .li‘AO (leiltlit) report on Nutrition
Capacity Assessment in Malawi. most of the incumbent: district: cd‘licers responsilzile for
coordinating and implementing nutrition programs do nor, have nutrition training. The
training materials developed will remain the property ol‘ Bundzrt College o t” Agriculture. There
is agreement by Bunda College that the use oi" this material will not incur an addititimal cost it"~
further courses are to be planned by UPC andr’or lrish Aid. The support received by the
college from OPC—DNHA and lrish Aid in developing these materials will be acknowledged.

o Collaborate with OPC-DNHA in the identiﬁcation and recruitment. oi"pn‘rspectivc participaiz‘its
from government and civil society for the training. Priority will be given to district ofﬁcers
responsible for nutrition from the Ministries of Health. Agriculture and Food Security,
Education and Gender and Child Development. According ,li‘AC) (Billie?) the basic
qualiﬁcation for these ofﬁcers range from a certiﬁcate to a bachelor’s degree. This will have

to be taken into consideration when deciding the composititm olian individual col‘ltnt.

- Provide and manage the training during the funding period.
0 Submit quarterly progress and ﬁnancial reports with, supporting documents.
0 Submit ﬁnal consolidated progress and ﬁnancial reports with supporting documents at the end

of the funding period in a format that will be agreed upon by Irish Aid.

This activity will complement other investments that other dtmors in l‘vlalawi have embarked
upon to build institutional and community capacity for nutrition tl'iereby addressing 6(2).le I‘lt‘iedﬁi
and Irish Aid’s own objectives. This support spans across three levels: tertiary. instituticmal and

community levels.

Links with National Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan
Malawi needs more qualiﬁed nutrition personnel. The biggest challenge to implementation ofthe

National Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan is not a lack of commitment among stakeholders, but

 

 

 

rather a lack of qualiﬁed personnel. One of the main objectives of the "National l'slutrititni lilolicy is
to increase the presence of nutrition workers in all 28 ot'iMalawi‘s district: areas-t

Increasing the presence of nutrition workers on the ground poses a serious cl‘itstllenge in terms of
ﬁnancing and in terms of recruitment. To date, posts. which include mitrition education, nutritirm
surveillance, and food and nutrition programme ofﬁcers remain vacant. ‘ntn. due to lack of

funding, but to lack of qualiﬁed personnel.

Capacity issues are some of the challenges outlined in the National 'i‘slut;["itltim Policy and Strategic
Plan. A preliminary training—needs assessment was conducted and it outlines a list. of short

courses required. Several Development Partners are ctmsidering prim‘itiaingg assistance in this

 

area as one of the potential solutions. Supprn‘ting this proposal is tl’tere'liore in line with the 
and Irish Missions Memorandum of Understanding for enhanced cooperation in lvlalawi over the
next three years which was signed on ll1h March 2010 and focuses on supportitngg the national
agriculture and nutrition policies in Malawi. The proposal is also aligned with. the global
framework of Scaling up Nutrition and the 1000 days initiative as agreed during the recent.

Millennium Development Goals Summit.

Bunda College of Agriculture's Department of Home Economics and lE'-'ltnnan Nutrition is

currently the only institution in Malawi to offer advanced training in nutrition.

Objectives
The main objective of this activity is to build capacity for middle managers ‘lirom  sectors in

food and nutrition security. The speciﬁc objectives include:

b. Conduct three training sessions for middle level managers :lirom government
nutrition sector. The training will include lecturers. group discussitnis of case studies,
practical sessions, guest speakers and ﬁeld visits to nutrition interventitm programs. "'l"‘he
participants will also be required to write tests on the different topics covered in the
