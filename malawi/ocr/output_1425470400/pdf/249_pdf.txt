Of notable mention, the main thrust of the MGDS is to create wealth through sustainable
economic growth. As such, agriculture has been singled out as the priority sector; it is envisaged
that the agriculture sector will lead to economic growth Thus, attainment of MDGs will be
dependant on a strong agriculture sector. Regarding sustainable economic growth, the MGDS
calls for action in the following areas: I) maximize contribution to economic growth through
sources of growth; 2) create an enabling environment for private sector led growth; 3) attain food
security; 4) boost exports so that they can lead to growth; 5) ensure economic empowerment of
the Malawi people; and 6) ensure access to land and housing.

UNDAF and the donor environment

In support of the Government’s objectives and priorities, the 2008-2011 Malawi UNDAF was
drafted with the central purpose to help Malawi achieve the MDGs as locally articulated through
the MGDS. The UNDAF is directly based on the MGDS and is in compliance with the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. In the ‘one UN’ approach, FAQ is the lead agency for the
UNDAF Outcome 1 ‘By 2011 Government policies and local and national institutions effectively
support equitable economic grth and the achievement of food and nutrition security while
minimizing or reversing environmental degradation’ supporting the MGDS priority of
‘Sustainable economic development and food security’.

Other main development partners in Malawi, excluding the UN, are: DFID (UK), CIDA
(Canada), GTZ (Germany), USAID (USA), EU (EC), JICA (Japan), Irish Aid and NORAD

(Norway). The following UN agencies have a presence on the ground: UNDP, UNICEF, WFP,
UNFPA, WHO, UNI-[CR and FAQ.

The main donors active in the area of Food and Nutrition Security in Malawi are DFID (UK), EU,
Norway, USAID (USA), JICA (Japan), Irish Aid and the UN family (FAO, UNICEF and WFP).
The EU provides additional capacity to the Ministry of Agriculture. The donors meet every two
weeks through a Donor platform for Food and Nutrition Security (DCAF S). The government has
been working closely with development partners in advancing the food and nutrition security
agenda since the agricultural symposium that was held about 5 years ago earlier to invite broader
participation from development partners and other regional bodies in the area of Food and
Nutrition Security in Malawi.

1.3 Sectoral policy and legislation

It was highlighted during the agricultural symposium that Malawi lacks an integrated response to
the recurring food and nutrition security situation, with many active initiatives, but little overvrew
or vision on how to integrate these different initiatives into an integrated and coordinated
approach, aligning policies and work plans of the different actors and harmonizing these
approaches under the umbrella of government policy. In 2005, a ‘National Action Plan for Food
Security and Nutrition in Malawi’ was developed by the Ministry of Agriculture with technical
support from FAO, which has subsequently led to government developing a National
Agricultural Sector Policy Framework (NAPF), highlighting eleven results-based priorities which
broadly include the need for tenure reform, sustainable natural resource management and
conservation, research, sustainable irrigation systems, microfinance, promotion of agribusiness
and value addition, and a conducive environment for smallholder productivity, livestock
production (including ﬁsheries and agro-forestry) and farmer organizations/cooperatives. For
effectiveness and in support of government, FAO and donor alignment to these priorities is
necessary. In a move towards further improving resource utilisation and coordination in the
agricultural sector, also noting nutrition vis-a-vis production, government developed the

 

 

agriculture sector wide approach programme (ASWAp)that donors and stakeholders are to
commit themselves to, e implementation of which will entail realignment of all programmes to
this agenda, ensure effective use of the available resources and effective monitoring and
evaluation of agricultural development programme activities, amongst others. The ASWAp and
Compact were signed by the government of Malawi on 19 th April 2010; the deputy minister of
agriculture expressed in her opening speech that all partners in the agriculture sector are expected
to adhere to the goals and principles of the ASWAp in general, and the Compact in particular.
Government of Malawi has received further support from FAQ to facilitate the finalisation of the
ASWAp for wide implementation.

2. RATIONALE

2.1 Problems and issues to be addressed

Achievement of the MDGs and the Government of Malawi’s priorities to achieve economic
growth and food and nutrition security as set forth the MGDS and the its goals in terms of
agricultural development as presently outlined in the ASWAp requires substantial effort and
investment. Food insecurity and unacceptably high levels of malnutrition in the country persists,
and the agricultural sector as an engine for growth, remains very far from developed.

Agriculture and the Food Security Situation

The most prominent feature on the economic front has been improvement in maize production,
the national staple food, not least as Malawi’s experience has attracted international attention as
to the relevance of lessons here for the whole continent. The 2007/2008 agricultural season
marked the third consecutive season of favourable rains and bumper harvests, contributing to
Malawi’s progress towards achieving improved food security. In 2008, ofﬁcial estimates reported
a 2.95 million MT harvest, signiﬁcantly above the average of the previous ﬁve years (2.19
million tonnes) and representing an excess of about 500,000 MT above the country’s yearly
staple requirements. In 2010 the country has produced 3.4 milliom MT. Malawi exported a little
over 300,000 MT of maize in the 2007/08 marketing year, the bulk of it to Zimbabwe and
donated some 20,000 MT as food aid for distributions in Lesotho, Swaziland and in Malawi itself.

In addition to record cereal production, the output of crops such as rice, pulses and groundnuts
have all increased. This positive outcome indicates a development in crops other than maize and a
signiﬁcant improvement in the diversiﬁcation of food crop production. In 2007, some 182,000
tonnes of cereals consisting of wheat and maize (51,000 tonnes of cross border imports from
Mozambique) and 57,000 tonnes of cereal food aid were imported in the country. In 2008/09 the
total cereal imports, consisting of wheat, rice, and maize (through cross border trade from
Mozambique) were down, primarily because of the reduced maize import needs.

Alongside good rains, the Government’s agricultural Input Subsidy Scheme (fertiliser and seed
subsidies) has played an important contributing role to the season’s harvest, increasing fertiliser
use in the country and improving productivity.

Constraints to agricultural growth

There are a number of factors that contribute to food insecurity in Malawi. Socio-economic
factors such as very limited access to improved technologies (limited dissemination and use of
better practices), mono cropping and access to affordable agricultural inputs (fertilizers, improved
maize seed). These factors directly impact upon productivity levels (agricultural growth) that are
a key factor in physical availability and access to food. Lack of access to capital for investment
purposes compounds the situation. In addition to low agricultural productivity, poor infrastructure
— physical and market, ecological constraints, limited arable land and many other demographic
and social factors contribute. It remains that a large majority of rural households are facing a

a l \t\.\

 

persistent lack of economic opportunity to produce sufﬁcient, safe and nutritious food or to
exchange labour to generate income with which to purchase this food. However the Input Subsidy
Programme that the government has implemented over the last four seasons has signiﬁcantly
improved access to inputs.Productivity has as a result gone up from an average of 800kg/ha to
around 200kg/ha.

household distribution of food in relation to nutritional needs of individual members, also affects
ind1v1dual’s ability to beneﬁt nutritionally from food that is available at the household level.
Compounded by a dependence on cereals (making up two-thirds of total energy intake), lack of
dietary diversiﬁcation and a shortage of essential vitamins and minerals in people’s diet,
adversely affects children’s growth and mental development and impairs adults’ capacity to work
and stay healthy. Nutrition education coupled with crop and dietary diversiﬁcation are vital
strategies to help households improve their food security and improve the nutritional status of
individual household members. Nutrition education should provide information on the food and
dietary needs of different houschold members and encourage learning by doing so as to empower
household members to change behaviours on food, diet, health and hygiene that are vital for
nutrition improvement. A particular focus should be placed on improved maternal and infant and
young children feeding and intra-household food distribution in line with the nutritional needs of
vulnerable household members.

2.2 Stakeholders and Target Beneﬁciaries

During the second phase the project will continue to work at national level through the servnces to

be rendered by the international policy advisor to national level stakeholders in the area of food

 

security and nutrition. The most direct beneﬁciary of this activity will continue tolb: the:
Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS in the Ofﬁce of the PreSidentland Cabinet. 11 irec
beneﬁciaries will be the other ministries and departments involved in nutrition and food security
work and the food insecure households in Malawi in general who will beneﬁt in the medium and
long-term from more effective programmes and services.

District and local levels

During the second phase the project will ﬁnalise the not yet completed scheduled support to the
six Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) of the ﬁrst phase3 and will start to reach out directly to food
insecure households in newly selected EPAs in Kasungu and Mzimba districts, in each of which
three new EPAs will be selected“.

Selection of new EPAs will be made by the district authorities in consultation with project
management and priority will be given to those EPAs in close proximity to each other and where
food insecurity and vulnerability is widespread. In this way, management will be enhanced and
the likelihood of showing a visible impact will be greater. Selection of sites will further take into
account evidence of community interest, motivation and commitment, non-duplication of donor
supported activities, and access to markets for production envisaged by the project.

households and 10500 schoolchildren in both old (ﬁrst phase) and new EPSs and direct services
to approximate 15 000 households in the new EPAs, both delivered through the district and sub-
district level service providers. More than ﬁﬁry (50) percent of the resources allocated to the work
in Kasungu and Mzimba will flow directly to these grass-roots beneﬁciaries, who will be mainly
small-scale farmers. Also in the second phase special consideration will be give to marginal
farmers, the landless and women-headed households in both the more remote rural areas and peri-

a good start was made With this process, but further support is still needed.

It is'against this background for an integrated approach that the second phase of the project will
continue to provide technical assistance at national policy and programme level to better focus
food security and agricultural development policies and programmes on nutrition objectives and
outcomes and vice versa to make sure that nutrition policies and programmes do not overlook the
food security and agricultural development dimension. The impact of this intervention on the
household food security and nutrition situation of vulnerable households will be indirect through
better targeted and more effective programmes. The details of the activities to be undertaken in
this area are given under Output 3 “Policy and Programming Component” of the project’s
Logical Framework.

At the same time, the second phase of the project will continue provide assistance at the
decentralised level by providing technical assistance and resources to Kasungu and Mzimba
districts for turning national policies and programmes into concrete action. This will entail two
types of project intervention.

The ﬁrst type of project intervention will be to provide technical assistance to the district and sub-
district staff as well as community workers to develop community and district plans and develop
capacity to reach out with providing educational/training support and direct services (micro
projects) to food insecure households in six new EPAs, three in each district. This in order to
address the diverse problems different vulnerable groups face in terms of achieving food security
and adequate nutrition status. The support to be provided by this project in this area is detailed
under Output 2 “District Outreach Capacity” of the project’s logical framework. The essence
of this component is provide technical assistance to build capacity among district, sub-district
service providers and community workers. This capacity will enable them to assess together with
the communities the food and nutrition security cimation, to identify interventions that will assist
vulnerable households and communities to overcome their problems and to translate the identiﬁed
interventions into micro-projects and educational/training support. Finally, this capacity will also
enable them to implement the identiﬁed support activities, and to monitor and evaluate in a
participatory manner the performance of these activities and outcomes in terms of food security
and nutrition status.

The second type of project intervention in terms of turning policies and programmes into action
in Kasungu and Mzimba entails the actual delivery of a comprehensive set'of educational/training
services to approximate 31 500 farming households and 10 500 schoolchildren in both old (ﬁrst
phase) and new EPSs and direct services (micro projects) to approximate 15 000 food insecure
households in the six new EPAs over the four years duration of the second phase of the pr0ject.
While the focus of direct service delivery — through micro-project — will be mainly on the food
security side of nutrition, micro-projects that will deal with issues related to access to potable
water, sanitation, nutrition education, social care and social organization are also env1saged. How
the project will support service delivery to food insecure households 15 detailed under Output 1

components for a more comprehensive approach (e.g. kitchen demonstration gardens at
Nutritional Rehabilitation Units and Home-based Care centres). In 2002, FAO also successfully
implemented a three-year pilot phase of a Special Programme for Food Security Project, which
aimed to improve household and national food security. This included identiﬁcation,

from SPFS and greater support. In view of the operational objectives of the on-going Norwegian
project, there is great scope for further scaling-up of activmes. Linking and sharing of
information and expertise is made possible, and scaling-up of activities can be made cost
effective. Given the successes and lesson learned from these projects, FAQ is in very good
position to scale—up its efforts, through expansion of area coverage and through added
components such as a nutritional component.

joint effort with UNICEF and WFP, FAO has implemented amongst others, a pilot project to
improve food and nutrition security of orphans and vulnerable children through a Junior Farmer
Fields and Life Skills approach which is based on learning by doing.

In terms of the Outreach Component of the project, it is assumed that the Government of Malawi
is fully committed to implement the participatory planning and action process as outline in the
project’s logical framework and has the required technical and managerial capacity for

implementing the process and supporting the community-level activities that will emerge from
the process.

In terms of the Policy Component of the project, it is also assumed that there is shared political
will and commitment amOng Government Ministries and Donors for re-focusing, wholly or in

part, food security and agricultural development policies and programmes on the achievement of
nutrition objectives.

4. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS

4.1 Institutional framework and coordination

The institutional framework and coordination arrangements during the second phase are more or
less the same as during the first phase of the project.

The project’s Policy Component relates directly to the Department of Nutrition and HIV and
AIDS within the Ofﬁce of the President and Cabinet (OPC). The International Policy Advisor to

be hired under this component will continue to be based in the Department of Nutrition and HIV
and AIDS.

The project’s Outreach and Outreach Capacity Components relate directly to three Ministries: the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MoAFS), the Ministry of Irrigation and Water
Development (MoIWD) and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
-(MoLGRD). MoAFS will have overall implementation and coordination responsibility for these

 

two components. The project manager, the two district managers as well as the newly hired
nutrition officer will be based in MoAFS at district level. Most of the project operations (e.g.
representing an estimated 50 percent of the outreach project budget) will be carried out and
managed directly by MoAFS and other Ministries and its decentralised units (e.g. DADD, E'ZPA)
through contracts to be closed between the project and the various departments and organizational

units concerned.

The different Ministries will be directly responsible for those activities that fall under their
speciﬁc mandates. E.g. MolWD will be responsible for ensuring that the necessary rights to water
use are obtained for the irrigation programme. In addition the irrigation department will be
responsible for all irrigation surveys, designs and construction. MolWD and MoAFS are both
responsible for drawing up irrigation schedules and recommending technological packages for
both irrigated and rainfed agriculture, respectively. MoAFS, however, is responsible for the
provision of general extension advice for agriculture and livestock production and natural
resource management. MoLGRD will be responsible for decentralised, local government
planning, management and ﬁnancial disbursement. "Local" in this context means the lowest level
of administration and management compatible with coherent and coordinated decision-making and
necessary executive authority. The principal unit of local government which meets this criterion is
the district.

Activities at the District level will be coordinated through the District Executive Committee
(DEC), chaired by the District Commissioner. Government funding at District level for all
ministries is channeled through the District Commissioner. The Govemment’s decentralized
structure has a core of essential qualiﬁed professional and technical ofﬁcers including irrigation
engineers, agronomists, and extension agents with experience in the requisite specialized areas.
Given that an integrated approach is crucial to the achievement of the project’s outcome, the
project will assist when and where needed to improve upon the existing coordination and
cooperation mechanisms among the different ministries and their decentralised departments.

The project will continue to work to the largest extent possible through the nationally and locally
existing implementation structures and apply the existing implementation modalities. In this way,
the project will avoid being regarded as an isolated island of resources whose impact is
unsustainable when project funding ceases. In this way the preconditions necessary for
sustainability can be ensured. It is clear that signiﬁcant impact cannot be made by the project
unless it is sustainable integrated within the local institutional context. This implies working
directly with governmental structures and local initiatives, building on and complementing what
is already in place and working.

A Project Steering Committee (PSC) at central level was established during the ﬁrst phase but
never actual became operational. In the second phase the project would like to make the PSC
more operational. The PSC is being chaired by the Principal Secretary (PS) of the MoAF S or his
designated person, and with the PM as its secretary. The PSC is responsible for overall direction
of project activities and provision of policy and strategic guidance. The PSC is a tripartite
committee, comprising representatives of the main stakeholders directly involved in project
activities. These include:

Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (and relevant departments)
Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development

Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development

Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (OPC)

FAO

Government of Flanders (Observer)

 

 

 

The PSC will convene on a six monthly basis to provide guidance and policy advice. PSC
meetings could be scheduled to ﬁt in with Government of Malawi’s budget preparation cycle.

The management structure will comprise of the operating/implementation unit, under direction
from the PSC and through the NPC, comprised of the PM, consultants and experts.

The focus of planning and coordination will be at the EPA and village levels where planning and
programming of project activities will be jointly conducted between planners, the project and
communities. EPA Annual Work Plans and Budgets resulting from these planning exercises will
ensure a common and cross-sectoral planning framework for coordinated implementation of
pr oject activities.

Department of Agricultural Extension (MoAFS)

The .Department intends ’to provide pluralistic and demand driven Agricultural Extension
Servrces m partnership With Civic, NGO, private and farmer organizations in order to empower

farmers. to improve agricultural productivity and thereby achieve food security and income
generation to reduce poverty’.

A new extension policy focuses on pluralistic, demand driven and decentralized extension
services. The policy allows for the participation of many players in addressing extension issues
usmg various methods, promoting participatory planning and implementation of agricultural
programmes at district levels. Extension Services are demand-not supply-driven. Depending on
their needs, farmers can demand advice to which the extension service providers respond.
Farmers are to become more in control of extension services than recipients.

Through its mandate, the Department coordinates agricultural extension activities, aims to
institutionalize decentralized extension service systems in all districts, institutionalize
Participatory Extension approaches in agricultural programmes, develop and disseminate
agricultural extension messages, enhance research and extension farmer linkages, coordinate
formation and management of farmer organizations, enhance gender and HIV and AIDS
mainstreaming, enhance agribusiness knowledge and skills in staff and farmers, promote dietary
diversiﬁcation and promote agro-based income generation projects for vulnerable groups.

Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development (MoAFS)
The department aims to promote livestock productivity, improve livestock based incomes and
promote sustainable use of natural resources in partnership with other stakeholders while

protecting the general public against zoonotic diseases for overall food security and poverty
reduction.

llll ll;

In order to achieve its objectives, the department undertakes to improve husbandry and health
services, breeding practices, intensify productivity per unit area, broaden livestock ownership
(and increase the livestock population), increase utilization of livestock and livestock products,
support highly potential livestock producers in urban and semi-urban areas, strengthen private
sector participation, increase smallholder access to credit and develop smallholder agribusrness
skills amongst its activities.

Department of Crop Production (MoAF S)

The Mandate of the Crop Production Department is primarily that of addressing the knowledge
gap at extension staff level to enhance diffusion of technologies generated by Research. The
mission is to promote sustainable crop production through increased yields and expansion of
hectarage for some selected crops.

Amongst its objectives and activities, the department provides policy, technical and professional
direction on all aspects of crop development and management, proliferates technologies and
ensures they are available to extension staff, promotes crop intensification and crop
diversiﬁcation to ensure diversiﬁed cash and food crop base, aims to reduce pre-harvest and post
harvest losses, promotes agro-processing and aims to improve department capacity so that it is
able to effectively respond to needs of the smallholder and estate sub sectors.

Department of Agricultural Research Services (MoAFS)

The mission of the Department is to generate and disseminate demand-driven and market-
oriented agricultural technologies and specialist services, through participatory and integrated
approaches in order to increase and sustain agricultural productivity by all stakeholders.

In the context of this project, the department can provide support in the project’s efforts to
promote conservation agriculture.

Department of Land Resources (MoAF S)

The Department’s mission is “committing herself to provide efficient and diversified services on
environmental conservation and education, land resource surveys and evaluation and land
management training to the farming community and other [and users for sustainable use of
land based resources”.

The department aims to achieve the following objectives: increase and sustain land productivity
for agriculture and other uses, improve planning, monitoring and evaluation of land resources
conservation programmes, establish a highly effective conservation infrastructure that integrates
research, technology development and transfer, education, and technical advise to assist land
owners and users manage and sustain natural resources, establish management information
systems and strengthen legislation and regulations governing land and water management.

Department of Irrigation (MoIWD)

The Department of Irrigation is mandated to manage and develop water and land resources for
diversiﬁed, economically sound and sustainable irrigation and draining systems under organized
small holder and estate management institutions. It aims to facilitate the increase and stabilization
of agricultural production, through mobilization of small and large scale irrigation projects with
human and ﬁnancial resources provision from beneﬁciaries, the private sector, NGOs and the
public sector; with full participation of the beneficiaries and ample observance of environmental
aspects to ensure sustained productivity.

Efforts to achieve objectives include the following: targeting resource-poor small holder farmers
for irrigation development and creating an enabling environment for irrigated agriculture by
facilitating and encouraging the private sector to invest in irrigation development and by
encouraging rural communities to manage the projects. Promotion of irrigation schemes range
from treadle pump irrigation, canalization, river diversion and motor pump irrigation.

 

 

Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (DNHA) in the Ofﬁce of the President and Cabinet
(OPC)

The DNHA is mandated to provide visionary guidance and strategic direction for the
implementation of the national response to nutrition disorders, HIV and AIDS in Malawi. It has
the goal of contributing to the development of the nation by ensuring the availability of a well
no urished and healthy human capital. The core functions of the DNHA include: spearheading and
coordination of national nutrition, HIV and A108 policies, strategies, plans and progrannes;
provision of technical support and guidance in the development, review and implementation of
sectoral policies, plans and programmes; facilitation of joint and evidence based planning,
mOnitoring and evaluation; institutional and human capacity development; enactment and
enforcement of relevant legislation etc.

The DNHA stakeholders include public, private, civil society and development partners’
organisations. The major government ministries for implementation of food and nutrition security
policies and programmes are: Agriculture and Food Security; Health; Gender, Children and
Community Development; and Education, Science and Technology.

4.2 Strategy/methodology

In terms of the project’s Outreach Component, the strategy is to support the implementation of a
participatory and integrated approach for addressing food and nutrition issues in the target
districts. The project will focus on building up local technical and managerial capacity among
district service providers for better targeting of and reaching out to food insecure households with
a menu of interventions/micro-projects that address the speciﬁc needs and build on the particular
potentials of the different target groups. In terms of the anticipated content of these interventions,
details are provided under section 2.3 project Justiﬁcation. Below is an outline of the process to
be followed by the project, whereas details on activities to implement this process are provided in
the logical framework under Outputs 1 and 2 which deal with the Outreach Component. The
strategy to be followed for the Policy Component is detailed in the Terms of Reference for the
lntemational Policy Advisor in Annex 3.

The strategy underpinning the participatory planning and action proeess to be promoted and
supported by the project aims at enhancing the capability of individuals and community
organizations to take charge and direct their own development. The purpose is to provide a space
at grass roots level where local service providers and interest groups can engage in a discussion
to:

— Review their past and present food security and nutrition situation and envision possible
future scenarios where their food security and nutrition problems are resolved in a
sustainable manner.

— Review and (re-)design the services the communities need and want to improve food
security and nutrition among vulnerable households and population segments.

— Review and (re-)design the manner in which services should be delivered so as to ensure
optimal outreach, especially to vulnerable households and populations segments.

The focus of this planning and action process is on the participatory design, delivery and
continuous improvement of a well-deﬁned set of relevant services in the most economic, efﬁcient
and effective way. In that sense, the process is essentially a tool that allows providers and users of
services to come together and jointly plan, implement and review service delivery from the
perspective ofthe users, in this case food insecure households and communities, ofthe services.

Before the actual participatory planning and action process can start the project will conduct a
baseline survey. In the ﬁrst place to obtain the needed baseline data for the ﬁnal impact

evaluation of the project but also to obtain a basic understanding of the nutrition and social
economical situation in the newly selected EPAs. The same was done during the ﬁrst phase of the
project in the old EPAs through two separate baseline surveys (nutrition and an social-economic
baseline survey). The baseline surveys will be carried in close coordination with the Ministry of
Agriculture which has developed impact and output indicators in order to harmonize the
monitoring and evaluation system of agriculture, food security, nutrition, natural resources and
ﬁsheries/or aquaculture project/programmes in Malawi.

The German-funded research project on complementary feeding will also contribute to the
baseline survey and impact evaluation, since the FICA programme and the German project have
common information requirements". This said, each project will require speciﬁc data. For
example, the nutrition research will require more detailed information about nutritional status and
infant and young child feeding practices, food taboos, common recipes, etc. The sample size and
selection is also likely to differ for the different data collection exercises. Finally, the two projects
have slightly different timeframes, in that the FICA programme will be implemented for four
years and the German research project for three. Efforts will nevertheless be made to ensure
maximum synergy between the survey, evaluation and research activities of the two projects. For
example, the German-project research results can serve as secondary data for the F ICA-
programme impact evaluation. It is also expected that the participation of the research team from
Giessen and local research institutions can enhance the quality of the data collection and analysis
used by both projects. The exact assessment methodologies to be used will be discussed between
the programme team and research team in the ﬁrst phase of the programme.

The actual participatory planning and action process will start with one day training of the
responsible extension staff in the selected new EPAs on the objectives of the project and process
to follow to identify the targeted vulnerable households and the needed support services. After the
training the extension staff will go to the villages and brief the local leaders. Together with the
local leaders the extension workers will organize a community meeting where the project
objectives will be explained. During those community meetings it will be explained that the
project speciﬁcally targets the vulnerable households and the benefiting groups will have to
include at least 50% vulnerable households (AIDS/HIV affected, children headed,
widowers/female headed households, physically challenged, households looking after orphans,
etc.). Together with the community and village leaders the extension workers will identify the
beneﬁciary groups after which focused discussions will be held with those groups on the speciﬁc
support (micro projects and/or educational/training support) the project could provide to them.

Originally it was planned that the service providers would purchase all the needed materials and
inputs for the identiﬁed micro projects with ﬁnancial support from the project through contracts.
This turned out not to be an efﬁcient approach and therefore most of the materials and inputs for
the micro projects were purchased by the project. For the second phase it has been decided that
the project will continue with purchasing the materials and inputs for the micro projects. These
seeds, fertilizers, small livestock, irrigation materials, etc. needed for the micro projects as well as
the educational/training support will be provided to the beneﬁciary households mainly through
the EPA extension ofﬁcers and community workers. To enable the EPA extension ofﬁcers and
community workers to do this the project will provide them with the needed training support.
When the project is not able to deliver the requested inputs and/or training/educational support
the project staff will link these household groups to other projects/organizations active in the two
project districts.

During the ﬁrst phase a few households did receive dairy cows. Although these dairy cows did
beneﬁt these households substantially and limited milk could be made available within the
communities, the project will not continue this support during the second phase because of the

 

6 All the resources required for the nutrition research part will be covered by the German-funded project).

 

 

d isproportional ﬁnancial support to only a few households. Instead the project will link
households interested in dairy cows with another FICA funded project in Kasunga and Mzimba
speciﬁcally focussed on the promotion of dairy farming.

Gender and HIV/AIDS will be crosscutting issues in all project activities. The project will also
p ay special attention to environmental issues by promoting conservation agriculture, the
establishment of woodlots and preparation and use of compost. In order to be able to provide all
the needed support to the vulnerable households in the targeted EPAs the project will assist the
d istrict agricultural ofﬁces to organize regularly coordination meetings with all the projects and
organizations active in the project districts in the ﬁeld of food security and nutrition, land
management.

4-3 Government inputs

As part of its contribution to the project, the Government of Malawi shall agree to make available
a National Project Coordinator and qualiﬁed technical personnel at district level for project
implementation. In addition government will provide buildings, training facilities and other local
services necessary for the implementation of the project. This support is expected to ensure the
full involvement and commitment of government staff to the project. As staff numbers are not yet
known, no speciﬁc estimate of the Govemment’s budget for provision of staff has been included.
MoAF S will be expected to continue making available suitable ofﬁce space in the vicinity of the
project. As a measure of Government contribution to the project, the Ministry of Agriculture’s
budget allocation to the two District Agricultural Ofﬁces of Mzimba and Kasungu is the basis for
estimation, covering operation costs and enumeration of district staff. As such, yearly
Government contribution is estimated at USD 567 000.

4.4 Donor inputs

The contribution from the Flemish Government is estimated to be equivalent to USD 5 350 013
(€ 4.] million). FAO in support of the Government of Malawi, will sub-contract activities for
implementation to Government where possible. Donor inputs through FAO are detailed as

follows:

Project staff

International Staﬂ

The placement of a International Policy Advisor in the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS
within the Ofﬁce of the President and Cabinet, is a key component of this project, ensuring that
nutrition is part and parcel in efforts to ensure food security and agricultural development. With
limited capacity in the area of nutrition at policy level, it is envisaged that an Advisor at P4 level
will continue to have a signiﬁcant impact. The International Policy Advisor will provide technical
oversight of the nutritional education component (including the complementary feeding
promotion), supported by the national nutrition ofﬁcer.

In the outreach component of the project, a most crucial factor to ensure project success will be
the project staff. Needless to say it is essential that high calibre people with the correct range of
skills are recruited. It is proposed that a TCDC FFS master trainer will be recruited for 3 month
during the ﬁrst and second year to facilitate the training of FFS facilitators. The TCDC expert

will report directly to the FAO Representative and be supported by FAO technical supervision
from within the region and headquarters, as required.

The Terms of Reference of the International Policy Advisor and TCDC FFS master trainer is
given in the Annex.

National statZ

Technical and Other Support Costs

As during the ﬁrst phase of the project one of the main challenges of implementing the project
will be the broad range of expertise required for farmer, extension worker and stakeholder
capacity building. The intention in this project is to rely in the ﬁrst place on local district and
national government staff, assisted by the local project staff and when and where needed national
and international consultants and technical backstopping from FAO sub-regional, regional and
headquarters offices. Regular supervisory technical support services (STS) will be provided by
the Lead Technical Unit, TCSF. TCSF will coordinate the technical inputs to be provided by the
various technical services. The following FAO units will be involved:

FAO Sub-regional Ofﬁce for Southern Africa (SFS)

FAO Regional Ofﬁce for Africa (RAF)

Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division (both AGSF and AGST)
Land and Water Division, (both NRLW and NRLA)

Plant Production and Protection Division (AGP)

Nutrition and Consumer Protection Division (AGN)

Animal Production and Health Division (AGA)

The Project will rely on strategic, recurrent, short-term inputs covering an appropriate range of
expertise corresponding to the scope of project activities.

It is anticipated that each of the services will continue to designate a core support person who can
provide support to the Project Manager and national project personnel over the life of the project
on a demand responsive basis. In order to develop appropriate understanding of the project
context and familiarity with project personnel, provision is made for annual backstopping visits
by core support persons.

The actual composition and timing of ATS and STS visits will depend on the needs of the
beneﬁciaries and project team. It is desirable to maintain some degree of continuity in STS
support through recurrent visits by at least some of the core support people since this will
improve understanding of and sensitivity to changing challenges and circumstances faced by the
project. More importantly, it will be feasible and desirable for the core support people to be “on-
call” through email requests once basic support relationships are established during site visits.
The consultancies periods are designed to be short (two weeks as an indicative length) so that the
expert has adequate time to visit the project sites. A total of USD 179 000 is proposed for STS
over four years.

In addition to speciﬁc technical support costs, the project budget includes seven percent
(7 percent) Project Servicing Cost (PSC) to cater for servicing costs incurred by FAQ.

General operating expenses

The general operating expenses are estimated at USD 395 336 over four years. The single largest
general operating expense will be vehicle operating expenses, estimated at USD 50 000 per year,
and the operating expenses of the International Policy Advisor. Provision is made for
communications including email and telephone. Other general operating expenses include
cleaning and upkeep of ofﬁces, utilities and insurance. The proposed budget includes USD 2 000
per year for miscellaneous general operating expenses.

Overall budget

 

The overall budget has been estimated at USD 5.33 million (dollar equivalent of the Euro 4.1
million FICA commitment) The Oracle budget for the project is provided in Annex l-A. Annex
laB provides details on the budget for the Outreach Component of the project and Annex 2-B the
budget for the Policy Component. At project inception, a baby budget will be established for the
Policy Component given that the institutional home of the two components is different and it
therefore is essential to manage the funds separately.

4.5 Technical support/linkages

The project will continue to take a comprehensive approach in dealing with food insecurity and
malnutrition and to support in a signiﬁcant way the implementation of Malawi’s Food Security
and Nutrition Policies and the formulation and implementation of the “Food Security and Social
Protection” pillar of the Agriculture Development Programme, which has effectively superseded
Malawi’s Action Plan for Food Security and Nutrition which was formulated in 2005 as the
transition from the pilot SPFS to a National Food Security Programme. Given the multi-sectorial
nature of the project, technical assistance from a range of technical units will be required. It is this
context that a Country Core Team, composed of the diverse technical units at headquarters and
decentralised ofﬁces will be established that will technically support the project’s ﬁeld activities
and its policy work. As in the case of other programmes in the context of FAO’s support to
National Programmes for Food Security (in this case Malawi’s ADP), the Integrated Food
Security Support Service (TCSF) will be the project’s Lead Technical Unit coordinating the
technical inputs from the Country Core Team. The Country Core Team will include inter alia the
Sub-Regional Ofﬁce for Southern Africa, AGSF, AGST, AGNA, AGNP, NRLW and NTLA, and
ESWD.

TCSF will carry out supervisory missions and the various technical units will provide technical
backstopping missions to the Outreach Components on a demand-basis as need arises from the
local planning processes. AGN and ES will provide technical backstopping to the Policy
Component.

In terms of FAO’s Strategic Framework, the project is linked to Strategic Objective H,
Organisational Result H01, which covers policy and programme support related to improving
capacity of Member countries’ capability for improving nutrition and food security.

The project will also be linked and share experiences and where feasible and relevant technical
assistance with other FAO project’s in the country including the Norway funded
GCPS/MLW/030/NOR Enhancing Food Security and Developing Sustainable Rural Livelihoods,
GTFS/RAF/394/ITA Enhancing food security in cassava-based farming systems in Malawi and
Zambia. The project will beneﬁt from additional technical nutrition expertise through its
collaboration with the German-funded project on Complementary Feeding research (pipeline
status). This partnership will also enhance the present project’s visibility since research findings
will be disseminated in international and regional fora on nutrition.

The project will also continue to develop close working relationships with WFP (e.g. food and
cash for work), UNICEF (on nutrition) and other relevant UN agencies, NGOs, Government
departments and other support service providers. The Intemationai Policy Advisor will work very
closely with the UN Country Team and through FAO provide the UNCT with regular reports on
the policy and programme work carried in the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS under the
Ofﬁce of the President and Cabinet.
