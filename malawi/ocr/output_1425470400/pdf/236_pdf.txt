EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project Background

The proposed Education IV Project has its basis in the government’s Policy Investment
Framework (PH?) for the development of the education sector. The PD3 defines the country’s
educational policies and strategies and outlines priorities for the period 2000—2012. The project
will support these policies and strategies by contributing to the improvement of the quality of
secondary education provided at the community day secondary schools, which has been accorded
a central position in the govemment’s strategy for poverty reduction.

Puggose of the Loan
The ADF loan of UA 15.00 million, amounting to 90% of the total project cost will be used to
finance 100% of foreign exchange (UA 11.74 million) and 66.2% of the local cost (UA 3.26

million).

Sector Goal and Project Objective

 

The sector goal is to increase coverage and improve the quality and efficiency of the education
system in Malawi. The objective of the project is to contribute to improved quality of secondary
education at the Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs) in the country.

Brief Description of the Project’s Outputs

 

In order to achieve this objective, the project will focus attention on (i) infrastructure
development, (ii) education materials provision, (iii) teacher education development, and (iv)
capacity building for school management.

Project Cost

The total project cost is estimated at UA 16.67 million out of which UA 11.74 million (70.4%)
will be in foreign currency and UA 4.93 million (296%) will be in local currency.

Sources of Finance

The project will be jointly financed by ADF and the Government of Malawi. ADF funds
will be utilized to finance professional services, civil works, furniture, equipment and supplies,
training, technical assistance, and operating cost. The total ADF contribution representing 90% of
total costs, will be utilized to cover 100% of foreign exchange costs and 66.2% of local costs
which represent 29.6% of total cost of the project. The Government of Malawi’s contribution of
UA 1.67 million, representing 10% of the project costs, will be utilized to cover parts of the civil
works and furniture. However, since the ADF—VIII allocation for Malawi has been fully
committed, an additional allocation of UA 15.00 million will be required to finance this project.
Given the project’s significant potential to contribute to the country’s poverty reduction
objectives, through improvements in the quality of education, this additional allocation will
further support the Bank’s development objectives as articulated in the CSP 1999—2001.
Furthermore, the resources will be utilized efficiently as reﬂected by Malawi’s good performance
rating in the 2001 Country Performance Assessment.

viii
Project Implementation

The project Will be implemented over a period of 4.5 years. The executing agency of the project
will be the Ministry of Education.

Conclusions and Recommendations

 

The proposed project responds to MalaWi’s need to improve the quality and equity of
education. It Will contribute to the Government’s effort to improve secondary education at
Community Day Secondary Schools. The project Will provide resources for infrastructure
development, instructional materials provision, teacher education development and capacity
building for school management, complementing assistance provided by other development
partners to the sector.

It is recommended that an ADF loan not exceeding UA 15.00 million be granted to the
Government of Malawi for the purpose of implementing the project as described in this report,
subject to conditions specified in the Loan Agreement.

1. ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE PROJECT

1.1 The 1999 World Human Development Report ranked Malawi 159 among 174
countries, and as one of the least developed countries. The report also indicates that about 60
per cent the population live below the poverty line, which is reﬂected in low social indicators.
For example, Malawi’s infant and maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the
region, at 128.3 per 1,000 and 620 per 100,000 respectively. Among other socio—economic
variables in Malawi that significantly constrain economic productivity is its education levels,
among the lowest in the region. The provision of quality education is central to the reduction
of poverty in Malawi.

1.2 The proposed project has its basis in the government’s Policy and Investment
Framework (PH3) for the development of the education sector. The PD3 is the education
sector’s response to the government policy of poverty reduction. The PD3 provides direction
in the development of education and is based on a comprehensive analysis of the education
sector in Malawi. It defines the country’s educational policies and strategies and outlines
priorities for the period 2000—2012. The PD3 was developed through an extensive participation
of all stakeholders and was the subject of a joint review of the Malawi education sector in
October 2000. Along with other development partners active in the sector, a Bank mission
participated in the joint review in October 2000 and identified the project at the same time,
following government request in June 1999 for a fourth education project. The Education IV
Project is planned to fit into this investment framework, by supporting the policies and
strategies expressed in the PD? The project was prepared by a Bank mission that visited the
country in March 2001 and was appraised in August 2001.

1.3 The project will assist government efforts to improve the quality of secondary
education provided at the Community Day Secondary Schools in Malawi. This is consistent
with the country’s strategies for reducing poverty as outlined in the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). In recognition of the impact of access to quality education on poverty
reduction, improvement of the quality of education at the Community Day Secondary Schools
has been accorded a central position in the PRSP. The project is also in line with the Bank’s
lending strategy for Malawi, which is to assist the country in its efforts to alleviate poverty
through sustainable and equitable growth and improved access to basic health and education
as outlined the Country Strategy Paper (1999—2001). In addition, the project complements the
assistance provided by other development partners and is consistent with the Bank’s
education sector policy.

2. THE EDUCATION SECTOR

2.1 The Education System

2.1.1 In its broader context, education is organized around three main categories: basic,
secondary and tertiary. Basic education includes pre—school, primary, and non—formal
initiatives such as adult literacy. The provision of pre—school education is not well organized
and is mainly left to private education providers. Pre—schools are much more common in
urban areas where such non—state providers have a ready market. There are however a few
parts of the country where communities have established their own day care centers.

2

It is estimated that there are 4,000 such day care centers in Malawi, concentrated mainly in 13
of the 33 country’s districts. Adult literacy is run under the National Adult Literacy Program
that is currently supporting almost 2,000 adult centers.

2.1.2 The formal education system is organized around 8 years of primary education, four of
secondary and four (or five) of university, depending on the degree program being pursued.
Annex H shows the structure of Malawi’s education system. There are currently 4,500
registered and unregistered primary schools enrolling about 3 million pupils (about 80% of
the relevant age group). During the last year of primary education, pupils register for the
Primary School Leaving Certificate Examination (PSLCE), which is used for selection for
secondary education.

2.1.3 It is estimated that there are 937 secondary schools in Malawi, which have an
estimated student population of 242,740 (about 18% of the age cohort). Secondary school
education is offered through three types of schools, namely: conventional secondary schools
(CSSs), community day secondary schools (CDSSs) and private schools. CSSs are
government supported day schools and are the most privileged with regard to educational
infrastructure and human resources. CDSSs, previously known as Distance Education Centres
(DECS), are the most disadvantaged. The third category is that of private schools managed by
individual entrepreneurs with no subsidy from government. There are two categories of
private schools: the designated schools, mostly catering for foreign students and therefore
following on European syllabus and those following the Malawi curriculum. The majority of
these private schools are comparable to CDSSs from the point of view of the available
teaching/learning resources. There are two national selection secondary school examinations;
the Junior Certificate Examination (JCE) done after two years of secondary school education
and the Malawi School Certificate Examination (MSCE) which is taken by students who have
completed four years of secondary education.

2.1.4 Tertiary education is provided at two levels: teacher training colleges and university.
Primary and secondary teacher training colleges, vocational and technical institutions and a
few other middle level professional colleges cater to those students who cannot gain
admission to university. There are approximately 8,000 students enrolled in 6 national
primary teacher—training colleges. An additional 500 are enrolled at the Domasi College of
Education, which trains secondary school teachers. The country’s technical and vocational
education institutions which are now under the management of the Ministry of Labor and
Manpower Development enroll a further 1,300 students. At the university level, the
University of Malawi and Mzuzu University provide university education to about 4,000
youth. About 0.8% of the relevant age group are enrolled in the tertiary level.

2.1.5 Provision of education is supported by a system of four national institutions. The
Malawi Institute of Education (MHE) develops and evaluates the school curriculum and
coordinates in—service teacher training. The Malawi National Examination Board (MANEB)
administers national examinations and develops examination syllabuses for all examinable
subjects. The Malawi National Commission for UNESCO links government ministries, the
intellectual and civil societies with UNESCO and its library is the official depository of all
UNESCO publications in the country. Finally, the Malawi National Library Service has the
responsibility of promoting, establishing, equipping and managing national libraries.

2.1.6 In keeping with the current Government policy of decentralization, the Ministry of
Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) is embarking on a policy of decentralizing
educational delivery. Already, there are moves to support the development of district
education plans to fit within overall district plans. However, the MoEST headquarters remain
largely responsible for the planing, management, coordination and financing of the national
education system. The organizational structure of the MoEST is shown in Annex HI. The
country is divided into six educational regions, which are further sub—divided into 33
educational districts. A district education office administers a number of school zones that are
the lowest administrative authorities. An average zone covers 10 to 15 schools.

2.2 The Current State of the Education System

 

2.2.1 Malawi has experienced some remarkable expansion of its national education system
during the last decade. At the basic education level, the introduction of free primary education
in 1994 resulted in a rise of the primary school population from approximately 1.4 million in
1990 to about 2.8 million in 1995 and to a high of almost 3 million in 2000. It is estimated
that almost 80% of the primary school age group are attending primary education. Progress
has also been noticeable at the secondary school sub sector. In 2000, approximately 250,000
Malawians were enrolled in secondary education compared to approximately 31,500 in 1990
and just over 48,000 in 1995. Likewise, the tertiary sub—sector is now opening up. As of 2000,
approximately 4,000 Malawian youth were enrolled in the country’s universities, up from
slightly over 3,000 in 1990 and about 3,500 in 1995. Almost 8,000 students are enrolled in
primary and secondary teacher training institutions.

2.2.2 Access however remains an area of concern at the secondary and tertiary levels where
approximately 18 and 0.8% of the relevant secondary and tertiary age groups are enrolled at
these levels, respectively. This represents some of the lowest enrolment ratios in Africa.
Moreover, the gains of increased primary school access have been somewhat diminished by
the fact that an average of 12 and 15% of those enrolled in primary education repeat or drop
out of the system, respectively. In fact, almost 30% of the children who enter primary school
do not progress from grade four to five.

2.2.3 A second major problem confronting the country’s education system is unequal
access. Although a number of measures have been taken to improve girls’ and women’s
participation in Malawi’s educational institutions, gender parity at all levels of the education
system has yet to be achieved. Girls are particularly under—represented at the secondary and
tertiary education levels. Currently, less than 40% of the secondary school population are girls
and only 5% of the Malawian girls of secondary school age are enrolled at this level of
education compared to 7% of the boys. And while approximately 1.2% of Malawian men
aged between 18 an 23 are enrolled in tertiary institutions, only 0.5% of the women are.
Women constitute less than 30% of tertiary education enrollment. Malawian girls are also
relatively under—represented in vocational training institutions and are more prone to
repetition and dropout. Females also form the majority of the country’s illiterates. In addition,
there are inequalities of access across socio—economic groups and regions as well as between
rural and urban areas.

4

2.2.4 A third major constraint is the relatively poor quality of education offered by the
country’s educational institutions as evidenced by the results of national selection
examinations. Many primary school children are taught in overcrowded classes by
unqualified teachers and have to share very limited teaching/leaming resources. More than
40% of the primary school teachers do not posses relevant professional and academic
qualifications. The average pupil: teacher ratio in primary school is 63:1. The average number
of pupils in a primary school classroom is about 119, an average of 38 pupils share 1 desk and
there are 48 pupils to a chair. The textbook situation is not any better as on average more than
20 pupils share a single textbook for the key subjects of English, Math and Chichewa. The
MoEST is addressing the textbook problem in primary schools by supplying almost 10
million books, which would mean that there would be a textbook for each pupil in primary
school. The poor state of the available leaning/teaching facilities also applies to secondary
schools and especially at the CDSSs. Available facilities in tertiary educational institutions
are also outdated and over—stretched beyond their capacities.

2.2.5 Moreover, effective mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the performance of
students are not in place. School inspectors are greatly handicapped not only by the large
numbers of schools they are expected to monitor but also by a lack of transport facilities.
Thus the Primary Education Advisors (PEAS) who are responsible for 10—15 schools and
more than 150 teachers cannot reach even a third of the schools under their jurisdiction during
an given school term. Also critical is the fact that many of the educational administrators
charged with the responsibility of monitoring the quality of education at all levels of the
system have not benefited from appropriate professional training.

2.2.6 Poor quality education is also a result of poverty—stricken households where there are
limited out—of—school learning opportunities due to a lack of reading materials and the mass
media, among other factors. Poverty is a particularly significant factor as it is the main reason
a substantial number of Malawian school going children are of poor health with many
suffering from malnutrition, a situation which greatly limits the learning potential of many of
them. The poor health and nutritional condition of many of these children are intensified by
the facts that once in school, they have to contend with the health hazards related to the
absence of school latrines and clean water. Less than 20% of Malawi’s primary schools have
access to safe drinking water and an average of 350 primary school pupils share one pit
latrine.

2.2.7 A fourth constraint is a school curriculum that needs to be more responsive to societal
needs. The school curriculum is particularly weak with regard to the teaching of science and
mathematics at the secondary school level. In fact, only about half of those studying science
subjects pass national selection examinations and thus join higher educational institutions, as
a result of which Malawi’s production of scientific manpower in the natural sciences is
relatively poor. Recently there have been efforts to review the basic education and secondary
school curriculum with a view to addressing its shortcomings.

2.2.8 Inadequate planning and management capacity is yet another constraint confronting
the system. Although the Government has embarked on a decentralization strategy in recent
years, the education system remains relatively centralized. This leaves little room for
flexibility by regional and local level school administrations with regard to issues such as the
determination of fees levels, use of funds raised locally, adjustment of the curriculum to local
needs, the recruitment of staff, or for the involvement of communities, parents, teachers, and

pupils in taking of educational decisions which affect them directly. A second administrative
challenge is that head teachers are usually overburdened with routine administrative matters.
This leaves them with little time to attend to the monitoring and evaluation of relevant
standards and the curriculum. In addition to these management—related problems, Malawi’s
educational system is characterized by a weak planning capacity, mainly due to a shortage of
professionally qualified planners and because mechanisms and capacity for gathering good
planning data is inadequate.

2.2.9 The impact of HIV/AIDS pandemic on the education system is another serious
constraint to the effective delivery of education services. Teacher absenteeism and mortality
resulting from HIV/AIDS is hampering the efficient functioning of the schools. Although it is
not easy to catalogue the exact magnitude of morbidity arising from HIV infection, survey of
sample schools indicates increased levels of absenteeism among teachers, which parallels the
increased levels of teachers living with HIV/AIDS. The death records from MoEST also
conform to the expected trend of increasing mortality in a situation where HIV prevalence is
high. The MoEST records show that 456 primary school teachers died in 1999. But a review
report in 1999 by Malawi School Support System Program, estimates that 2,369 primary
school teachers will die in 2001, five times the number in 1999.

2.3 Education Financing

2.3.1 The Govemment’s strong commitment to the education sector is underlined by the
fact that in fiscal year 2000/01, it allocated 28% of its total recurrent budget, one of the
highest in sub—Saharan Africa, to this sector. This represents 5% of GDP. In 1994, when free
primary education was introduced, recurrent budget for education was 20% of the total
government recurrent budget. The Government is also strongly committed to strengthening
basic education and has accordingly allocated 60% of its education recurrent budget to this
sub—sector in 2000/01. Tertiary education received the second largest share at 18% while
secondary education remains the least funded as this sub—sector accounted for 12% of the
recurrent education budget allocation in 2000/01. In the 2000/01, personnel emoluments
accounted for almost 90% of the recurrent budget allocations for the primary and secondary
education sub—sectors, leaving only 10% for relevant learning/teaching inputs.

2.3.2 Local communities, donor partners and the business community continues to play an
important role in supporting the national education system. Local communities and parents
contribute to education through sharing in the cost of buildings and their maintenance,
transport to schools, food, school uniforms, learning materials and extra—curricular activities.
It is estimated that local communities have participated in the building of almost 75% of the
country’s schools and most schools’ maintenance is officially their responsibility. At the
secondary level, almost 15% of Malawi’s secondary school population is enrolled in private
institutions.

2.3.3 In 1996/7 MoEST introduced the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
budgeting process as a way for improving the efficiency of the use of available educational
resources. It is hoped that this approach will lead to relatively greater macroeconomic balance
with the placing of GoM budgets within a realistic expenditure framework.

Among other things, the MTEF approach should promote: the articulation of broad policy
intentions; the commitment by the districts, divisions and some of the other cost centres to the
budgeting process through the preparation of Individual Activity Based Budgets (ABBs); and
the adoption of a participatory, bottom—up approach with regard to the preparation of ABBs.
The approach should also promote an integrated approach to budgeting with regard to
development and recurrent budgets.

2.4 Donor Interventions in the Education Sector

 

2.4.1 External development partners play an important role in the financing of the
Malawian education system. This is particularly the case with regard to development
expenditures. The donor’s share of the total MoEST development expenditure has averaged
more than 80% during the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 fiscal years. Secondly in 1999/2000,
total grants from the three major donors were equivalent to the total education development
budget. In addition to the main education donors, NGOs have continued to support education
mainly through the construction of school buildings. In order to minimize duplication of
effort donors have accelerated efforts to improve coordination as evidenced by their joint
support for education sector reform, the holding of a joint sector review in October 2000 and
the strengthening of the monthly donor meetings, which are now chaired by the Minister for
Education.

2.4.2 More than 75% of the donor support has been directed to basic education. Those
active in the sector include: ADB, CIDA, DANIDA, DfID, KfW, GTZ, JICA, The
Government of Norway, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNFPA, USAID and the World Bank. For
2001, donor support for the sector is estimated to be about US$ 56 million. Annex IV
summarizes the size of present support by each agency and the area of support.

2.4.3 Donor support focused on improving access and equity, quality and relevance and the
planning and management capacity for all levels of the system. In the area of access and
equity, the emphasis has been on the construction and rehabilitation of primary and secondary
schools. Donors have also supported programs aimed at improving the participation and
retention in primary and secondary education of disadvantaged groups such as females, the
physically disabled and children living in remote and poor environments. In the area of
quality and relevance, the focus has been on: teacher training including in—service teacher
training; the construction and rehabilitation of teacher training colleges and Teacher
Development Centres (TDCs); curriculum review and development; provision of text books;
enhancement of school health and sanitation; provision of safe drinking water; awareness
creation related to HIV/AIDS and the introduction and popularization of the life skills’
curriculum; and on the improvement of school assessment systems. With respect to
management and planning, donor resources have been directed toward: the development of
national and district level education strategies; national school mapping and census exercises;
the development of an education management information system (EMIS); the construction
and rehabilitation of district education offices; training of educational managers, teachers and
other educational stakeholder groups, including primary education advisors (PEAS), heads of
schools, teachers, school management committees and community leaders on planning and
management issues; improvement of central, regional and district planning capacity; and
toward the development of a decentralized structure for continuing education, advanced
training and supervision.

2.5 Education Policy Framework

 

2.5.1 The Government’s education strategy is spelt out by the Education Sector: Policy and
Investment Framework (PIF). The PD3 outlines five main objectives for the education system.
The first of these is the improvement of access to educational opportunities at all levels of the
education system. At the basic education level, the intention is to arrive at a net enrolment
ratio (NER) of 95% in all districts by 2012. At the secondary school level, the aim is to
increase the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) from the current 18% of the relevant age cohort
to 30% during the same period. Participation in tertiary education is to be raised from the
current 0.8% of the relevant age group to 1%. Accordingly, appropriate measures for reducing
poor attendance, enrollment, repetition and dropout are stated.

2.5.2 Secondly, the PH3 proposes measures for improving the equity of access and outcomes
particularly for disadvantaged social and economic groups and regions. In this connection, the
PH3 identifies relevant strategies for improving the participation of girls and women, children
with special needs and other disadvantaged youth and that of rural communities at all levels
of the education system. It is proposed that female participation at the primary, secondary and
tertiary levels are increased to at least 50% of the total enrollment at all levels of the
education system.

2.5.3 Pm’s third objective is to enhance the quality and relevance of the country’s
education. With regard to quality improvements, appropriate strategies will aim at combining
the right inputs, the right processes and the right outputs. The relevance of Malawi’s
education system is to be achieved through ongoing reviews of the curriculum aimed at
ensuring that it addresses the needs of individual school goers and those of the country more
effectively. Because adequate numbers of professionally qualified teachers are critical for
promoting these goals, The PD3 stresses the need for a quality and sustainable teacher—training
program as a way of promoting quality and relevant education.

2.5.4 Fourthly, PHj outlines measures for developing an institutional and financial
framework to sustain the country’s education system. In this connection, the PH3 underlines
the need to strengthen the capacity of the MoEST and relevant regional and local institutions
to plan and manage educational programs in a more cost—effective manner. Finally, the PH:
encourages those in society who can afford it to share in the cost of education provision while
ensuring that the poorer sections of society are not forced to drop out of school because of
inability to pay. In recognition of the crucial role that communities, the private sector and
international development partners could play in the development of education in Malawi, the
PH3 proposes strategies that will encourage an increase in their investment in this sector.

3. THE SUB-SECTOR
3.1 Secondag Education

3.1.1 Secondary education begins after the 8 years primary education cycle. Secondary
education aims at equipping its recipients with appropriate skills and knowledge to facilitate
further education as well as their survival as individuals and participants in the nation’s socio—
economic and political spheres. In view of this, the govemment’s goal as spelt out in the PD3
is to raise the enrollment of the relevant secondary school age group from the current 18% to
30% and to improve the quality of education provided by the country’s secondary schools.

3.1.2 Secondary education comprises a junior and a senior cycle. The junior cycle consists
of the first two years of secondary education after which students sit for the JCE. The great
majority of students who pass this examination continue to senior secondary school, also
consisting of two years. From the point of view of employment or further education and
training, the JCE is of minimal value and in fact there have been calls for its abolition.
Successful completion of the final two years of secondary education qualifies eligible
students to sit for the MCSE that opens a wide variety of opportunities in terms of both
employment and further training for those who pass it.

3.1.3 Before 1998 secondary education was provided through four main types of secondary
schools; government school; grant—aided schools; Distance Education Centers (DECS); and
private schools. In 1999, the MoEST reclassified the secondary school system as follows:
conventional secondary schools (CSSs); Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs); and
private schools.

3.1.4 Until the ongoing national school mapping exercise is completed, it is difficult to give
accurate statistical data on secondary education and particularly on the CDSSs. Nevertheless,
it is estimated that there are 937 secondary schools in Malawi. CDSSs are by the majority at
approximately 556. They have an estimated enrollment of 166,781 students of whom 6,723
(37%) are girls. There are 103 CSSs enrolling an estimated 58,174 students, 22,294 (38%) of
whom are girls. An estimated 278 registered private schools enroll about 17,245 students,
7,507 (44%) of whom are girls. An estimated further 4,200 students are enrolled in the non—
registered private schools. The system of selecting students for these schools varies for the
different school types. From among the CSSs, national schools are the first to select from a
national merit list. They therefore pick the top performing students. Former grant—aided
schools then select the best from those left out by the national schools. CDSSs and private
schools are the last to select and therefore pick the lowest performing students, although some
high performing students may join the top quality private schools if they so wish. Currently,
selection for the national boarding and day schools and government day/boarding schools is
based on the principle of admitting at least 15% of the students from the local catchment area
of the school. The other 75% are selected from the rest of the country. CDSSs select their
students from their respective localities while private schools selection process is open. PHj
has recommended a local catchment area selection system but this has yet to be implemented.

3.1.5 All secondary schools with the exception of the designated schools offer the same
government approved curriculum. The revised curriculum promotes a broad learning
approach according to which students have to be proficient in languages, mathematics,
sciences and humanities. The curriculum of both the junior and senior secondary cycles is

9

organized into core and elective subjects. For the junior cycle, the core curriculum comprises
of English, Math, Agriculture, Physical Education, Chichewa, Integrated Science and Life
Skills. The electives include a range of subjects depending on what is feasible for specific
schools but must include at least one of the following: Geography, History and Social
Studies. A student is expected to select a total of eight subjects (6 core and 2 electives) in
which they have to pass in at the JCE. The core curriculum of the senior cycle comprises of
Chichewa, English Language, Math, Science and Technology, Social Studies, Life Skills and
Physical Education. Students can select their electives from a wide range of subjects but again
depending on the situation of the schools, these electives should include at least one of the
following subjects; Literature in English, Literature in Chichewa and Crafts and Art.

3.1.6 There are an estimated 4,325 teachers (942 or 22% female) in the secondary school
system. About 68% of these teachers are not qualified for secondary school teaching,
adversely affecting the quality of education provided. In most CSSs, the curriculum is
delivered by qualified teachers, but in the CDSSs, the great majority (93%) of the teachers are
academically and professionally under—qualified. It is estimated that if all the secondary
schools have to be equipped with academically and professionally qualified teachers, the
system would need approximately 700 new teachers annually for the next 5 years. This, plus
the upgrading of the under—qualified teachers is one of the biggest challenges facing the
secondary school sub—sector today. The continued shortage of secondary school teachers led
to the opening of Mzuzu University in the northern part of the country. Bunda College of
Agriculture trains agriculture teachers and the Polytechnic also supplies some science
teachers. In 1999, approximately 300 trained secondary school teachers graduated from the
country’s teacher training colleges. About 600 of the under qualified secondary teachers are
also receiving in—service training managed by Domasi College of Education. The remaining
under—qualified teachers can benefit from similar in—service teacher training program.

3.1.7 Within the MoEST, the division of Education Methods Advisory Services (EMAS) is
entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the quality and relevance of education offered
by the country’s public and private secondary schools. Among other responsibilities, the
functions of EMAS include: the coordination and supervision of teaching and learning; the
coordination of teacher support including pre—service and in—service education; coordination
of the secondary school assessment and evaluation system; planning, review and
implementation of the curriculum for both schools and relevant teacher training institutions;
and registration of private secondary schools. With the policy of decentralization, the
functions of EMAS as they relate to the inspection and monitoring of the secondary system
have been devolved to the education divisions under a Senior Education Methods Advisor
(SEMA). However, although the target of decentralization is the district, there is no secondary
education Methods Advisor for a district. At the school level, head teachers and heads of
departments deal with issues of quality assurance. Capacity for advisory services at the
secondary level therefore needs to be strengthened.

3.1.8 The Director of Secondary and Higher Education who is based at the MoEST
Headquarters oversees all management issues of the secondary education system. A deputy
director of secondary education, two assistant deputy directors and a senior education officer
assist him. Division managers who are based at the divisional headquarters oversee matters
related to secondary administration in the divisions. At the division level, a desk officer for
secondary education is directly responsible for the administration of secondary education. The
division planner who is also responsible for primary education planning issues assists

10

him/her. With the implementation of the decentralization policy, the District Education
Officer (DEO) shall coordinate the management and planning issues of secondary education.
This will require the replacement and/or retraining of the current crop of under—qualified
DEOs.

3.1.9 Below the districts, head teachers are responsible for managing their respective schools
with the support of school boards and their teachers. But the management skills of most
secondary schools heads, deputy heads and heads of departments are seriously lacking. About
10% of school managers, all of them from CSSs, have received training in school
management aimed at making schools effective. Similar training is needed for CDSS
managers to build the capacity required for improving the effectiveness of the schools.

3.1.10 On financing, secondary education is allocated 10% of the total MoEST recurrent
expenditure. The bulk of these funds are spent on personnel emoluments and boarding
facilities in CSSs and CDSSs. In 2000/01, personnel emoluments and boarding facilities
accounted for approximately 40 and 16% of the total recurrent expenditure for secondary
education while teaching/leaming materials accounted for approximately 5% of the available
recurrent funding in this year. Students attending CSSs and CDSSs pay modest tuition and
boarding fees as well as a small deposit for textbooks and examinations. Until 1999, students
in the CDSSs met the full cost of their tuition and boarding expenses while the government
met the costs of teacher salaries and learning/teaching materials. It needs to be said that for
both the CSSs and CDSSs, fees collection rates are less than 50%. Since 2000/2001,
secondary education has received 60% of the education sector development expenditure
compared to 30% for primary education and 10% for the tertiary sub—sector. This is as a result
of the government policy of taking over CDSSs with the aim of improving the quality of
education offered by them.

3.2 Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs)

 

3.2.1 The origins of CSSs go back to 1964 when Malawi attained political independence.
At independence, Malawi inherited a highly elitist secondary education system. In 1965 for
example, only 5% of primary certificate holders found a place in the country’s secondary
school system. Yet the immediate independent govemment’s aim for education was to
accelerate the production of an educated cadre of Malawians to take over the middle and
senior management positions left vacant by the colonial administrators. The post—
independence government therefore embarked on a program to expand secondary education
as a result of which every district had at least one government secondary school by 1982.

3.2.2 Despite these government efforts, access to secondary education for the relevant age
group has remained severely limited. An alternative mode for delivering secondary education
had to be identified; thus the birth of the CDSSs.

11

CDSSs were initially started under the Malawi Correspondence College (MCC) in 1964 and
were then known as Distance Education Centres (DECs). DECs were run as part of the
Malawi College of Distance Education (MCDE) which replaced the MCC in 1980. The aims
of MCDE were to provide: an alternative for the secondary school age population who could
not be accommodated by the formal system; and secondary schools’ teachers upgrading
courses. The MCDE depended on three main modes of instruction, namely: printed materials,
radio broadcasts and audio tapes available at designated MCDE centers.

3.2.3 Although the MDCE Program was originally envisaged as a correspondence program
for both primary and secondary education, by the late 1990s more than 80% of their students
enrolled for subjects offered by the formal secondary school system. In recognition of this
demand for formal secondary educational opportunity by a large number of Malawians, DECs
were converted to CDSSs in 1998. The intention was to upgrade CDSSs with a view to
having a unified national system of secondary school education provision. Such a policy was
not without a price. DECs were constructed by communities, with provision for some poorly
constructed classrooms, and were staffed by primary school teachers paid by the government.
But the DECs, were converted to conventional secondary schools without being provided
with relevant physical infrastructure; teaching/leaning facilities and the required qualified
teaching force.

3.2.4 Compared to CSSs, CDSSs provide education of very poor quality. Many of these
secondary schools operate in borrowed primary school premises, are run by a largely
unqualified teaching force, are characterized by inadequate and overcrowded classrooms, lack
essential teaching/learning materials and have no libraries and science facilities. In the CSSs,
almost 90% of the teaching force are qualified for their teaching responsibilities compared to
7% in the CDSSs. With regard to teaching/learning materials, more than 15 CDSSs students
share 1 text book in the key subjects of English, Math and Physical Science compared to an
average of 6 students in the CSSs. Severe inequalities between the two systems are also
apparent in the realm of physical facilities. While an average of 114 CDSSs students share a
classroom, 93 of those in the CSSs do the same. Only 10% of CDSSs have science teaching
and library facilities compared to 60% of the CSSs. Such inequalities in the level of available
human and physical resources explain much of the differential achievement in the MSCE. In
1999 for example, almost 30% of the CSSs students who sat for the MSCE passed it
compared to about 4% of those who were enrolled in the CDSSs. Annex V gives comparative
data on Malawi’s secondary school system.

3.2.5 It would thus appear that CDSSs deserve almost immediate attention if the quality of
education offered here has to show any significant improvement. Thus, although access for
secondary education in Malawi remains a major problem, it is necessary to support programs
aimed at consolidating these access gains by strengthening the capacity of secondary
education and particularly, the CDSSs to offer education of some quality. Support is thus
urgently needed with regard to the provision of relevant leaning infrastructure, classrooms,
science laboratories, libraries, administrative blocks, teachers' houses, textbooks, science
equipment and other relevant inputs. Given that a key contributory factor to the poor quality
of secondary education in general and CDSSs education in particular is the severe shortage of
qualified teaching staff, it would be useful to support in—service teaching programs as a way
of addressing this problem.

12

Finally, improved management and planning capacity are critical in ensuring that the impact
of relevant physical and human inputs are sustained in the long run. One way of contributing
to strengthening of this capacity is through training of school heads and secondary education
methods advisors on management and maintenance skills.

3.3 Donor Interventions in the Secondary Education Sub—Sector

 

3.3.1 DANIDA is the principal donor at the secondary education level. In the area of policy
planning DANIDA has supported secondary school policy development as part of the PH3 and
division and secondary schools cluster developments aimed at strengthening secondary
education provision and management. In the area of access, support has focused on physical
infrastructure improvement revolving around secondary school mapping and data bank
generation, girls’ bursary schemes and on the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of
secondary schools, including the establishment of school construction and maintenance
procedures. DANIDA is also active in developing an effective advisory and support services
through the Education Methods Advisory Services (EMAS). With regard to secondary teacher
education, DANIDA is supporting teacher training and the development of a secondary
teacher training strategy. In addition, DANIDA is putting some funds in programs targeting
senior secondary school curriculum improvement, the development of a sustainable textbook
provision and the upgrading of school libraries.

3.3.2 In the secondary school sub—sector, JICA supports a program for the strengthening of
science and mathematics education in secondary schools. This program revolves around
actual training, targeted technical exchanges and study visits by science and mathematics
teachers. A second JICA initiative focuses on the dispatching of Japanese volunteer teachers
to needy Malawian secondary schools. Future J ICA support in this sub—sector may involve the
expansion of Domasi College of Education; and construction of teaching facilities for
secondary schools.

3.3.3 ADB, the World Bank, CIDA and UNFPA are also active in the secondary education
sub—sector. ADB and World Bank support has included the construction and rehabilitation of
some secondary schools, the provision of school textbooks and other leaning/teaching
materials and the development of HIV/AIDS materials. CIDA is supporting a distance
education diploma program in education for 600 secondary schoolteachers in collaboration
with Domasi College of Education. CIDA is also working with the MoEST and other donors
to develop an Education Management Information System (EMIS) for both the secondary and
primary education systems. UNFPA support has focused on the development of an integrated
syllabus for junior secondary in the areas of social studies, agriculture, home economics,
biology and geography. In this connection, UNFPA is funding the development of appropriate
textbooks for students and of a methodology guide for teaching these subjects. Future
support in this area is to include the printing of ICE textbooks and teachers’ guide books for
all career subjects and the orientation of secondary school teachers in the teaching of the
revised curriculum.

4. THE PROJECT

4.1 Project Conception and Rationale

 

4.1.1 This project is a response to the GoM’s poverty alleviation strategy as enunciated by
the country’s PRSP. The PRSP highlights the critical role education could play in alleviating
poverty and in generating the human resources that could contribute to the country’s socio—
economic and political advancements. To achieve these goals, the PRSP lists as priorities the
expansion of educational opportunity for disadvantaged groups and the improvement in its
quality as the key building blocks of a long—term national educational strategy. These issues
are underlined by the official government policy in education as spelt out by the Education
Sector: Policy and Investment Framework (PH3). PHj was finalized in 1999 following lengthy
consultations with the majority of the country’s education partners. It identifies appropriate
strategies for enhancing the quality of education at all levels of the education system. For
secondary education, the main focus is on upgrading the standards of poorly equipped
CDSSs. Towards this end, this proposed project would aim at complementing GoM and other
development partners’ efforts to strengthen the capacity of a selected number of CDSSs to
offer education of acceptable quality. The project has been developed through an extensive
participation of key stakeholders whose involvement will continue during implementation.
Views of education planners and managers, school administrators and teachers, parents and
external financing agents were sought and incorporated in the design of the project. It should
also be pointed out that the schools the project will support have been founded with strong
community participation. The DECs, which became the CDSSs, although poorly resourced,
were constructed by the communities. The project will thus be complementing community
initiatives.

4.1.2 To date the Bank has funded three education projects in Malawi. The first two
projects approved in 1980 and 1986 for ADP loans of UA 7.37 million and UA 15.66 million
respectively are complete. The third project approved in 1997 for an ADF loan of UA 12.00
million is on—going and is being implemented very satisfactorily. The projects aimed in
general to increase access and improve the quality of primary and secondary education, and
build capacity for educational planning and management. The new project will reinforce these
objectives. Lessons learned from the implementation of the earlier projects will also inform
the new project. For example, the successful implementation of the on—going Education 1H
project is attributed to the effective management of the project by a competent project staff
and the adequate supervision of the project by the Bank. The integration of project activities
fully into the operations of the Ministry of Education and the close coordination with other
development partners has also meant the efficient use of project resources.

4.2 Project Area and Beneficiaries

 

4.2.1 The project sites will be distributed throughout the country. However, since most
CDSSs serve remote rural communities, the schools that the project will support will be
located in disadvantaged rural areas. The actual schools to be supported by the project will be
determined on the basis of the outcome of the on—going school mapping survey, which is
expected to be completed by end of November 2001.

14

As a condition of first disbursement, MoEST will submit for fund approval the list of the
districts and locations of the schools to be supported by the project.

4.2.2 Initially, the most direct beneficiaries of the project will be students enrolled in the
secondary schools that will be supported through the project. As of now, it is estimated that
40 CDSSs will be supported. Each of these schools will have a minimum student population
of 160, which means that almost 7,000 students will benefit from the improved secondary
school education at any given time. Since CDSSs are generally located in rural areas, the
majority of the beneficiaries of the improved learning conditions will be students from
disadvantaged communities.

4.2.3 Other beneficiaries of the project will be the almost 2500 professionally under—
qualified secondary school teachers to be upgraded through the project’s in—service training
program. Female teachers will be among the major beneficiaries of this training. This is
because more than 90% of the female teachers in CDSSs are professionally under—qualified.
As the project will aim at training most of the untrained teachers currently working in the
CDSSs, a conscious effort will be made to include the majority, if not all, the under—qualified
female teachers in the lot of the project’s trainees.

4.2.4 Females students will also be beneficiaries of the project. As of now, girls represent
almost 40% of the enrollments in the CDSSs. Although performance in national examinations
is poor for both boys and girls, during the last decade, girls enrolled in CDSSS have tended to
perform slightly worse than the boys in the JCE and MSCE for all subjects except Chichewa
and Bible Knowledge. In 1999 for example, while 5% of the boys who sat for the MSCE
passed, only 1% of the girls did. By improving the conditions of the CDSSs through the
training of their under—qualified staff, the building and rehabilitation of infrastructure, the
provision of science and library facilities, equipment and books as well as other facilities
likely to appeal to females, such as latrines and clean water, it is likely that the achievement
levels of female students will improve and more of them will be attracted to CDSSs.

4.3 Strategic Context

4.3.1 The goal of education as stated in the PRSP is the alleviation of poverty. PHj
reinforces this position by stressing the developmental and poverty alleviation role of good
quality education. Among others, the objectives include the promotion of access to quality
health and education; an economy supported by a strong scientific and technological base; an
equitable distribution of wealth; and a sustainably managed environment. This project will
reinforce these goals in a number of ways. Firstly, the improvement of 40 secondary schools
will promote quality education that is likely to open up increased employment and higher
education opportunities for graduates of these schools, thus preparing them to better
contribute to the development of the economy. The project will also promote the national goal
of strengthening the country’s scientific and technological base as all the project schools will
be equipped with science facilities, equipment and relevant science textbooks. Unqualified
teachers in these schools will have their teaching skills upgraded which will make them better
teachers for science and other subjects. Overall, the project will contribute to improving the
productivity of the economy, as those graduating from the project’s schools will be better
equipped for employment and further education.

15

4.3.2 Second, the project will promote the goal of moving toward some form of equitable
distribution of income by making it possible for graduates of originally disadvantaged schools
to compete on an equal footing with those from the more advantaged conventional schools. It
is also noteworthy that many of these beneficiaries will come from rural areas of Malawi, as
most CDSSs are located there.

4.3.3 Finally, the project will contribute to developing healthy human resources by
promoting improved health standing among students from the projects’ schools and their
teachers as well as their immediate associates by putting resources in programs focussing on
HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.

4.4 Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to contribute to improved quality and equity of
secondary education provided at the Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs) in Malawi.
This will be achieved through the establishment and rehabilitation of physical facilities,
provision of educational materials, training of under—qualified teachers and capacity building
for school management.

4.5 Project Description

The project, which will be implemented over a period of four and half years, will
consist of five components with following outputs:

0 Based on a maximum of 4 classrooms per school site, the project will construct/
rehabilitate 160 classrooms at 40 CDSSs, providing a total of 6,400 class spaces in
schools where very little provision currently exists or the facilities are in dilapidated and
impermanent structures. 40 science facilities, 40 libraries, 40 administrative blocks, and
80 teachers’ houses will be built. 160 double and 80 pit—latrines provided, together with
40 boreholes with hand pumps. Playgrounds will also be provided where none exist.

0 Science equipment, books and other teaching leaming—materials for pupils at project
schools will provided.

0 2,500 teachers will be trained under the project’s in—service teacher training program and
two fellowships in secondary teacher education will be provided.

0 As a capacity building for schools, and in support of the policy strengthening the methods
advisory services, 300 school managers and methods advisors will receive training in
school management.

0 The project will support the operational costs of implementation for the 54 months of the
project period.

4.6 Project Activities and Components

 

4.6.1 The project will include a range of activities within the following categories:

(A) Professional Services
(B) Civil Works

(C) Furniture

(D) Equipment

(E) Training

(F) Operating Costs

The details under each component are as follows:

Component 1: Infrastructure Development

 

4.6.2 In view of the need to improve the quality of secondary education at the CDSSs,
especially in the rural areas of Malawi, this component is intended to improve the provision
of physical facilities that will enhance the quality of the education provided. The schools that
the project will assist as indicated in paragraph 3.2.4, have no science teaching and library
facilities; classrooms are either lacking or dilapidated and overcrowded, unfit for teaching and
learning; and latrines and access to safe water are absent. Thus the need to upgrade these
schools to the minimum physical standards set by the government justifies the use of
resources for school infrastructure development.

(A) Professional Services

4.6.3 Architectural and engineering services for the rehabilitation/new construction of
existing community day secondary schools, will be required to carry out site surveys,
including levels and soil conditions and to prepare the adaptations of the standard designs for
the classrooms and other facilities to the site layouts, adjust to contours and other parameters,
and include provision of drinking water by appropriate means. After tendering and selection
of contractors, carried out by the PIU, full post—contract services and site supervision will be
required by consultants until final completion. The progress of work on sites will be fully
supervised by regular visits by the consultants, who will also maintain clerk of works with
day—to—day supervision for the duration of the contracts.

(B) Civil Works

4.6.4 The civil works under the project’s first component comprise the rehabilitation,
modification and extension of facilities and service infrastructure at 40 existing community
day secondary schools, in selected districts.

4.6.5 Typically, a community day secondary school will have the following facilities:

— administration block with head teacher office, staff room, administration and store
— 4 classrooms in two blocks

— library and laboratory block

— 2 student toilet/latrine blocks, 4 units each

— 1 teacher toilet/latrine block, 2 units

17

— 2 staff houses
— internal roads, sports ground, fences, gates, walkways, storm water drainage

(C) Furniture

4.6.6 All furniture required for the above—listed facilities will be provided under the project
in accordance with specified lists prepared by MoEST. Built—in furniture will be provided for
under the construction contracts. The main items of loose furniture will be tables, chairs,
desks, storage and display units and any other items of essential furniture required for the
functioning of the schools. Locally produced furniture will be used as far as possible in order
to make future repairs and replacements cheaper.

(D) Equipment
4.6.7 The project will provide adequate general office equipment to the schools to be
constructed in accordance with the MoEST list of standard office equipment and supplies for

community day secondary schools.

Component 2: Educational Materials Provision

 

4.6.8 Given the lack of science teaching equipment, and inadequate supply of books and
other teaching/learning materials, this component provides for these materials, in as much as
they enhance the quality and efficiency of secondary education provided at the CDSSs.

(D) Equipment

4.6.9 The project will supply and deliver educational materials in sufficient quantities to
provide for all the project schools. The materials will comprise science equipment and
consumables for the 40 science facilities; text books for core subjects provided at a ratio of
one book per student per subject; books and reading materials on HIV/AIDS; supplementary
reading materials; books for the 40 libraries; teaching and learning aids such as charts and
maps. The books to be supplied will be identified by the schools and will be available from
commercial suppliers in and outside the country.

Component 3: Teacher Education Development

 

4.6.10 The component aims to support MoEST efforts to reduce the number of under—trained
teachers in CDSSs, through the provision of in—service training. The component will provide
about half of the MoEST’s needs for this type of training.

(E) Training

4.6.11 A program of in—service training will be funded by the project for about 2500 CDSS
teachers. Teachers will receive training in both content and methodology. The training will
also include training in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, gender and environmental
issues. Appropriate staff from Colleges of Education, Universities, EMAS, TDCs, and
schools will be used to provide the training, which will principally consist of a period of 8
weeks of residential training followed by a period of distance learning. Capacity for
secondary teacher education development will also be strengthened through the provision of

18

long—term training for two of the Teacher Education Department (TED) officers. A detailed
training program will be submitted following loan effectiveness.

Component 4: Capacity Building for School Management

4.6.12 This component will assist in efforts to build capacity for school management at the
CDSSs through the provision of training. The component will provide training for a
significant number of school managers as well as EMAS staff involved in the delivery of
secondary education at the CDSSs. The component will further support the development of a
maintenance culture and strengthen community school and local administration in support of
effective maintenance projects and decentralized maintenance policy implementation.

(E) Training

4.6.13 Training in curriculum and facilities management, which will also cover HIV/AIDS
awareness and prevention, gender and environmental issues, will be provided for about 300
CDSS school managers. The training, which will consist of one—month duration, will be
provided using staff from MoEST agencies, including the University of Malawi, and other
agencies identified by MoEST as being appropriate. The capacity of EMAS will also be
strengthened through the provision of long—term training to 2 EMAS staff members and short—
term training of 3 months duration to 6 EMAS staff. Training of one—week duration in school
infrastructure maintenance will be provided for school managers, teachers and community
members and organized at the schools. A detailed training program will be submitted
following loan effectiveness.

Component 5: Project Management

 

(D) Equipment

4.6.14 In view of the large number of project sites in deprived rural areas and the need for
regular supervision of the project activities, the project will fund the provision of three
vehicles and ten motor bicycles for project coordination and site supervision. Two desktop
PCs with software and printers, one photocopying machine and basic office equipment for
project management will also be provided.

(F) Operating Costs
4.6.15 The operational costs in carrying out the administration, coordination and procurement

activities necessary for the successful completion of the project, will be met by the project for
the 54 months of implementation.

19

4.7 Environmental Impact

4.7.1 As the project aims basically at rehabilitating existing school infrastructures, it has
been classified in the category H according to the Banks environmental guide—lines. The
project will have minimal negative impact on the environment provided that the mitigation
measures indicated below are properly implemented. All the construction work to be done
will consist of one—story buildings. Principles of environmental protection will be observed in
the civil works in terms of preserving existing trees and planting new ones. Where there is no
existing water supply, the construction of boreholes has been proposed to ensure the
availability of good quality water. As far as the disposal of human waste is concerned, the
existing facilities, which are foul smelling pit latrines, will be replaced by ventilated
improved pit latrines (VIP). In order to prevent any health hazard from laboratory waste each
school will be provided with a fenced laboratory waste area or small incinerator, and septic
tanks will be constructed for liquid waste.

4.7.2 The production of burnt bricks is a well known and widely applied building
technology in Malawi. Furthermore, it represents a main source of income for people in rural
areas. The burning of bricks with fuelwood, however, also constitutes a serious
environmental problem in light of the deforestation taking place in many areas of the country.
The ADF education projects have so far used burnt bricks for construction of schools, while
other donors supporting the sector (DFID and DANIDA) are now recommending the use of
Stabilized Soil Blocks (SSB). In view of the large number of schools to be constructed in the
Education IV Project, it is recommended to use such environmental friendly building
material. A large number of school buildings have already been built with Stabilized Soil
Blocks, which consumes only approximately 7% cement. The blocks are produced with block
making machines, which contributes to a high quality. This construction technology will be
specified in the project for areas with suitable soil.

4.8 Project Costs

4.8.1 The total cost of the project, net of taxes and customs duties, is estimated at UA 16.67
million, of which UA 11.74 million is in foreign exchange and the equivalent of UA 4.93
million is in local currency. For the purpose of costing, all items have been priced in USD and
converted into UA at the exchange rate applicable in the Bank for the month of August 2001.
A summary of project cost estimates is given below in Table 4.1 by component and in Table
4.2 by category of expenditure.

4.8.2 The cost estimates for civil works are based on current tenders for similar facilities
with base costs up—dated to August 2001 (time of appraisal). The cost estimates for furniture,
equipment and supplies are based on data obtained from the PIU and the MoEST. Physical
contingencies are set at 10% of base costs for all categories of expenditure. Price
contingencies are estimated at 3% inﬂation per year both for foreign costs and local currency
costs since the project is priced in USD, with 90 % of the total cost being funded in UA. The
detailed project cost estimates are shown in Annex VI.

4.9 Sources of Financing and Expenditure Schedule

4.9.1 The project will be financed jointly by the ADF (90%) and the Government (10%) as
shown in Table 4.4. The ADF’s contribution, with a loan of UA 15 million, will meet 100 %
of all foreign exchange costs and 66.2 % of local costs. The Government will finance 33.8 %
of the local costs, estimated at UA 1.67 million, which represents 10 % of the total project
costs. In addition, the Government will finance all taxes and duties. It is noted that the ADF—
VHI allocation for Malawi has been fully committed. Therefore, an additional allocation of
UA 15.00 million will be required to finance this project. Given the project’s significant
potential to contribute to the country’s poverty reduction objectives, through improvements in
the quality of education, this additional allocation will further support the Bank’s
development objectives as articulated in the CSP 1999—2001. Furthermore, the resources will
be utilized efficiently as reﬂected by Malawi’s good performance rating in the 2001 Country
Performance Assessment.

4.9.2 The ADF’s financing of part of the local costs, covering professional services, civil
works, training and operating costs, is justified given the social nature of the project. Malawi
is making determined effort towards mobilizing internal and external resources to the

 

21

requirements of its increased budgetary allocations to the social sector as reﬂected in the
PRSP. The increase in the share of education in the budget (from 20% in 1994 28% in 2000)
and the limited availability of foreign currency due to balance of payment constraints justifies
ADF financing of part of the local costs.

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 Executing Agency

The MoEST, through its Planning Department, Will be the executing agency for the
project.

5 .2 Institutional Arrangements

 

5.2.1 The existing PIU, currently responsible for the implementation of the ADF Education
1H Project, Will be retained and strengthened to implement and supervise the project. The PIU
has already the following administrative staff at its offices in Blantyre: project coordinator,
architect, procurement officer (quantity surveyor), and an accountant. It also engages
consultants for the professional services required. Given the increased scope of the work
compared to the on—going project, the capacity of the PIU Will be strengthened by the addition
of a structural engineer to its staff. The PIU, Which is fully integrated With regular operations
of the MoEST, has successfully and efficiently managed the ADF projects.

5.2.2 The Director of Planning of MoEST Will have the overall responsibility for the
coordination and management of the project. The project coordinator, under the direction of
the Director of Planning, will be responsible for the implementation of the operational
activities related to the project. The teacher education development and the capacity building
components Will be implemented in collaboration With the TED, EMAS and the Secondary
Education Department.

23

The technical staff of the PIU (architect, quantity surveyor and structural engineer) will be
responsible for the implementation of the infrastructure component, including the day—to—day
inspection of construction works, tender documents and designs, whereas the accountant will
be responsible for the project accounts. Detailed job descriptions for these staff are stated in
the PID. Basic office equipment, vehicles for supervision and necessary funds for the
activities related to the implementation of the ADF project will be provided under the project.

5.3 Supervision and Implementation Schedules

 

The project will be implemented during a period of 4.5 years (54 months) from
effectiveness of the loan, assumed to be in the first quarter of 2002. The implementation
schedule is presented in Annex VH. The Bank’s supervision plan is presented in the PID.

5.4 Procurement Arrangements

 

5.4.1 Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.1 below and described in detail in
the PID. All procurement of goods, works and services financed by the Bank will be in
accordance with the Bank’s Rules of Procedure for Procurement of Goods and Works or, as
appropriate, Rules of Procedure for the Use of Consultants, using the relevant Bank Standard
Bidding Documents.

5.4.2 Malawi’s national procurement laws and regulations have been reviewed and
determined to be acceptable. However, recent changes in the review process of procurement
activities by the government has resulted is some delays in the implementation of both
government and external supported programs, including some of the activities of the ongoing
ADF project. The government is planning to revise the review process to address the
concerns of funding and executing agencies. The PIU will be responsible for the procurement
of goods/services/training and the resources, capacity and experience are adequate to carry
out the procurement in accordance with the Bank’s Rules of Procedure.

Civil Works

 

24

5.4.3 Civil works for rehabilitation and expansion of 40 Community Day Secondary
Schools, valued at UA 8.76 million, will be procured under National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) as individual contracts for each site or grouped in lots of two to three schools. The
value of each contract will be UA 0.2 million. Given the remote location and the scattered
nature of the sites and the size of the contracts, it is unlikely to attract foreign competition.
But there is sufficient number of qualified local contractors to ensure competition. Eligible
bidders resident within or from outside the borrowing country, may also submit bids, if they
wish to participate.

Goods

5.4.4 Educational equipment including equipment for science laboratories for 40 CDSSs,
valued at UA 2.84 million will be awarded under International Competitive Bidding
procedures. Office and general equipment (UA 0.56 million) will be awarded under NCB.
Given the small size of the contracts, this is the most efficient and economical way of
procuring these goods.

5.4.5 Furniture valued at UA 0.57 million and office equipment valued at UA 0.22 for 40
CDSSs will be procured under NCB as two contracts. Given the nature of the goods and size
of the contracts, it is unlikely to attract foreign competition. But there is sufficient number of
qualified local suppliers to ensure competition. Eligible bidders resident within or from
outside the borrowing country, may also submit bids, if they wish to participate.

5.4.6 Vehicles for 3 field supervisors and motorbikes for 10 clerks of works for the
technical support and supervision of construction works valued at UA 0.12 million, will be
procured through IAPSO. Office equipment for the project management, valued at UA 0.02
million, will be procured under National Shopping procedures. This is the most efficient and
economical way of procuring these goods.

Consulting Services and Training
5.4.7 Professional services for the preparation of tender documents for rehabilitation work
and new construction for 40 CDSSs, as well as site supervision, estimated at UA 1.35
million, will be procured in accordance with the Bank’s Rules of Procedure for the Use of
Consultants. Selection will be through short—listing following the procedure of technical
quality with price consideration.
5.4.8 Training valued at UA 2.24 million will be through a shortlist of training institutions.

Miscellaneous

5.4.9 All items financed under operating costs for Project Management (UA 0.53 million)
will be procured in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to the Fund.

25

5.4.10 The text of a General Procurement Notice (GPN) has been discussed with the PIU and
will be finalized at negotiations. The Bank will publish it in the UN Development Business
magazine, upon approval of the loan.

5.4.11 The following documents are subject to review and approval by the Bank before
promulgation: Specific Procurement Notices; either shortlists and Requests for Proposals (RFP)
including TORs for consultancy services and training institutions; Lists, Designs,
Specifications, Tender Documents, with Draft Contract Agreements for Civil Works, Furniture
and Equipment; Tender Evaluation Reports, or Reports on Evaluation of Consultants’
Proposals, including Recommendations for Contract Award; Draft Procurement Contracts, if
these have been amended from the drafts included in the tender documents, and draft contracts
for consultancy services and training.

5.5 Disbursement Arrangements

 

It is envisaged that the following disbursement methods will be followed for the
various components and categories of expenditure: one Special Account for civil works,
operating costs and training (related to the ADF loan), the establishment of which will be a
condition precedent to first disbursement; and direct payment method for professional
services, equipment and furniture.

5.6 Monitoring and Evaluation

 

5.6.1 The project management will submit to ADF quarterly project progress reports
(QPPR) in accordance with the established format covering all aspects of the project, within
30 days following the end of each quarter. The project management will also prepare and
submit a project completion report in accordance with the format recommended by ADF.
Additional reports and clarifications will be submitted to the Fund as required.

5.6.2 A mid—term review will be conducted after two years to evaluate progress. ADF will
be responsible for undertaking the review in collaboration with the MoEST. Participatory
approach will be ensured in the review process. In the event there will be a need for
modification of the project for the remaining two years, submissions will be made to ADF for
consideration.

5.6.3 The key progress indicators for monitoring delivery of project inputs and
achievements of project outputs are described in the Project Matrix. These include

performance of students in key subject areas and performance in completion exams.

5.7 Financial Reporting and Auditing

 

The project management will maintain separate project accounts to ensure efficient
monitoring of project implementation. Detailed accounts concerning expenditure from ADF
and Government should allow identification of expenditure by project component, category of
expenditure and source of finance. The accounts and ledgers will be kept separately from
other projects and be adequately secured. The office of the Auditor General will audit the
project accounts. The accounts will be presented annually to ADF, within six months
following the end of each accounting period, along with a mid—year summary.

26
5.8 Aid Co—ordination

The PD3 is the guiding document for education development in Malawi. All
development partners active in the education sector support and assisted in the development
of the policies and priority strategies contained in the PD? The development of the PD3 is also
seen as the first stage in a process that will lead to the adoption of a Sector Wide Approach
(SWAP) and the development of a sector investment program. Monthly donor meetings have
also significantly improved donor coordination and partnership with the government. Annual
joint reviews of the sector (first one took place in October 2000) will further strengthen the
aid coordination and effectiveness of programs. Supervision missions of the project will be
planned to coincide with the annual sector reviews. Additionally, project activities will be
coordinated with those of DANIDA, which is the principal external supporter of quality
improvement at the CDSSs and with those of CIDA which provides assistance to the
upgrading of CDSS teachers.

6. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
6.1 Recurrent Costs

The recurrent costs generated by the project are relatively small. This is because the
schools to be supported through the project already exist and that the major recurrent cost,
teachers’ salaries, is already met by the government. Moreover, the Public Expenditure
Review supports the movement of resources toward the provision of relevant
leaming/teaching inputs, which will be required for the replacement of materials after the
initial stock provided by the project is exhausted. Recurrent costs related to maintenance of
facilities will be met by communities and management training which heads of schools will
undergo will help in improving preventive maintenance. The PD3 requires schools to invest at
least 0.5% of the value of their school buildings on maintenance starting in 2001.

6.2 Project Sustainability

6.2.1 The project should benefit from the GoM’s strong commitment to the education sector
as is evidenced by the fact that currently, 28% of the recurrent national budget is being
allocated to education. Also significant is the fact that the PH3 advocates for the strengthening
of all the areas that will be the focus of this Project. With regard to quality improvement, PHj
directs that all secondary schools be upgraded to minimum operational standards. Appropriate
strategies for achieving this goal are outlined and include: strengthening of the secondary
schools’ quality assurance system; the upgrading of the professional capacity of head teachers
and heads of departments; provision of adequate instructional materials; strengthening of
school assessment systems; and awareness creation related to HIV/AIDS. On management,
PHj advocates for the establishment of basic school management and maintenance systems,
which among other things will provide for community involvement and management for the
project schools.

27

6.2.2 Among other things, the design of this project was informed by the need to promote
sustainability of its expected outputs. Firstly, to ensure long—term sustainability of the
infrastructure, materials and equipment provided through the project, there will be a training
program for head teachers and teachers of the project schools as well as secondary school
methods advisors. Relevant training will also focus on equipping school administrators with
appropriate management skills, which will promote a more cost effective utilization of the
project’s facilities as well as improved time management. Secondly, through the use of simple
designs, the project will attempt to establish structures that are not difficult to maintain.
Additionally, this project will benefit from the experience of the ADF PIU and collaboration
with other donors active in the sector such as DANIDA and CIDA. The PIU has gained
considerable experience in project management through implementing the previous three
ADF projects, and is fully integrated into the regular operations of the MoEST. Finally, the
schools, which were established with community assistance, continue to have the support of
the communities, which is essential for long—term sustainability. For example, each school
has a school development committee from the community, which leads the mobilization of
resources for infrastructure development and maintenance.

6.3 Critical Risks and Mitigating Measures

 

6.3.1 One of the risks associated with this project relates to the possibility of the GoM
directing the expansion of the project schools to take in more students than the capacity of the
facilities provided through the project and without commensurate increase in the level of
recurrent expenditure allocated to these schools. This may result from the facts that the better
equipped schools attract more students and because continued expansion of the primary sub—
sector will put added pressure on the few existing secondary schools to admit more students
than their actual capacities. To minimize the effects of this risk, continued dialogue on the
implementation of the PH3 strategies that relate to the upgrading of the existing secondary
schools to relieve pressure on the project schools would be maintained. Moreover, it is
expected that communities and parents will contribute to the expansion of available
infrastructure as well as toward their maintenance.

6.3.2 A second risk relates to inadequate maintenance of the project’s facilities. This project
will address this possible outcome through a training program for school heads and education
methods advisors which, among other things will focus on cost—efficient management of
limited resources as well as on the maintenance of existing resources to benefit larger
numbers of students. The Project schools will also be encouraged to strengthen their security
systems in order to minimize loss of materials and equipment through vandalism. In addition
to allocating more resources for school security, the project will promote the idea of
community policing for school and other educational administrators as part of the training
programs.

6.3.3 The incidence of HIV/AIDS among teachers and other education officials targeted by
the project could reduce the impact of some of the project’s outcomes. MoEST is committed
to promoting awareness on the epidemic. It is expected that the training program for teachers
and education methods advisors will complement these efforts.

28
7. PROJECT BENEFITS

7.1 Economic Analysis

7.1.1 Employers are becoming increasingly concerned about the ability of their new
employees to follow written instructions, to communicate effectively, and to take advantage
of modern scientific technology in the course of their duties. By strengthening measures
aimed at enhancing the quality of secondary school education, the project will contribute to
increasing acceptance of secondary school graduates by employers and post—secondary
training institutions. Although opportunities for formal sector employment may be limited,
being able to successfully complete secondary education increases the graduate’s chances of
both employment and post secondary training.

7.1.2 Outside of formal employment, the project should enhance the productivity of
graduates who enter the non—formal sector. This would be a significant development as it
would be consistent with one of the stated goals of secondary education, namely the
preparation of graduates for informal sector employment. The potential of this employment
sector has yet to be fully exploited especially by those possessing reasonable levels of formal
education. As of now, many of the Malawians involved in the country’s informal sector are
relatively elderly individuals without much formal education. Yet research on small and
medium size enterprises attests to the fact that possession of at least secondary education is an
important influential factor with regard to business success. In fact, among other results, the
liberalization of most sub—Saharan economies has encouraged regional trade that requires
those involved to be able to: communicate in foreign languages; utilize electronic
communication; and to handle international travel. All this calls for an above average level of
education on the part of such entrepreneurs.

7.1.3 Support for science subjects in the secondary school curriculum should also contribute
to generating additional opportunities for secondary school graduates. This is because
improvement in the scientific competency of graduates of schools where science education
will be strengthened will open doors for careers that call for above average mastery of
scientific knowledge which is not possible in most CDSSs as they lack both science facilities
and teachers. In fact, a ready market for nurses and teachers already exists in Malawi. Partly
due to the HIV epidemic, Malawi faces a severe shortage of health care personnel in most of
the country’s health facilities. It is estimated that as many as 40% of the posts in the Ministry
of Health and Population are vacant. Many of these openings are for professionally trained
nurses. With the inputs this project is to invest in science education, beneficiaries of the
project will contribute to filling in the human resource gap in the health sector.

7.1.4 By supporting training programs in HIV/AIDS for both teachers and school managers
and by providing relevant HIV/AIDS materials for secondary schools and their teachers, the
project will further enhance efficient utilization of existing human resources in the education
sector. This is because HIV/AIDS is among the major cause of teaching and administrative
staff attrition due to illness and death. What is more, much teaching time is lost because of
participation by teachers in AIDS—related functions, particularly funerals and because teachers
who are sick due to HIV/AIDS are less effective in their teaching even when they report for
work.

29

Nor are students infected with HIV likely to benefit maximally from their time in school.
Thus, in addition to promoting awareness on HIV/AIDS among the project’s beneficiaries,
teachers and those education administrators who will have profited from the HIV/AIDS
aspect of their in—service training and the students who will be recipients of books focussing
on HIV/AIDS which will be provided through the project, the project will contribute to
enhancing both the internal efficiency of the secondary educational system and effective use
of the available educational resources.

7.1.5 Finally, outside of the education system, the project will have economic benefits for
Malawian entrepreneurs and workers who will be contracted to do building works, to provide
teaching materials and equipment and other professional services. These individuals and
organizations will have additional opportunities for generating income.

7.2 Social Impact Analysis

7.2.1 The project will address a number of the key obstacles to Malawi’s socio—economic
development. It is estimated that more than half of the Malawian population is absolutely
poor surviving as they do on less than US$40 per capital per annum. One manifestation of
poverty in Malawi is the extreme inequalities in the provision of basic social services across
socio—economic groups, gender and regions. This is particularly the case with regard to
education, a particularly serious problem given that access to it is perhaps the single most
important determinant of upward mobility for a majority of poor Malawians. While equity of
access is less of a problem at the basic education level due to the policy of free primary
education, it remains a problem at the secondary school level where fees are charged.
Moreover, some of the best secondary schools in Malawi also tend to be the most expensive
and teaching/learning materials are less accessible to the poor. Learning conditions for poor
secondary students are also very poor as a result of which they find it more difficult to
compete for scarce university places with their counterparts from the better endowed home
backgrounds. Because access to quality secondary schools has much to do with the quality of
primary school preparation, the more economically advantaged Malawians also join the best
secondary schools. Hence, poor quality CDSSs, most of which are located in remote rural
areas, remain the only option for most poor Malawian students. By focusing on secondary
education in general and CDSSs in particular, the project will contribute to addressing the
problem of unequal access to quality secondary school opportunity.

7.2.2 Second, by supporting improvement of the quality of education provided by schools
close in proximity to where students live, the project will contribute to improving learning
conditions for female students. This is because parents are more likely to allow girls to attend
school when the distance to travel is relatively short. Furthermore, by strengthening the
teaching of science in the project schools, female students enrolled in them are likely to be
more interested in pursuing the sciences than they would have if they did not have this
opportunity. In this way, they stand a chance of benefiting from opportunities open to
students who are competent in the sciences.

7.2.3 Third, Malawi’s fertility rate (6.3) is among the highest in sub—Saharan Africa. From a
population perspective, the education of the graduates of the schools benefiting from the
project will result in gains for themselves, their families and the country at large.

30

This is because a better—educated population has been known to be more likely to have
smaller families, a situation that is likely to lead to reduced pressure on limited family
earnings and on a nation’s social services, including health and education. Furthermore, focus
on health education related to HIV/AIDS, use of clean water and other sanitation facilities
(latrines, clean water) provided to the project schools, should promote a health culture and
better health standards not only among the teachers and students directly benefiting from the
project, but also among the wider population who may have the opportunity to interact with
these teachers and students.

7.2.4 Finally, by strengthening the secondary sub—sector, this project will assist in enhancing
the capacity of Malawi’s education system to generate some of the human resources required
for the country’s development. In the first place, emphasis on basic education since the
education for all impetus of the early nineties has resulted in the neglect of the secondary and
tertiary education sub—sectors such that only about 30% of the Malawian pupils graduating
from primary education hope to enroll in secondary education. Worse still, the quality of this
secondary education, and particularly of the CDSSs remains very poor. Yet, Malawi needs a
strong secondary education sub—sector not just for the reason that it is the bridge between the
basic and tertiary sub—sectors but more so because secondary education imparts cognitive
skills that enhance productivity more broadly. It also needs to be appreciated that with recent
donor and government initiatives which reinforce the contribution of good tertiary education
to Africa’s development, Malawi needs a strong secondary education sub—sector that can
contribute effectively to the production of graduates to enroll in the country’s tertiary
education institutions.

8. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1 Conclusion

To address the inadequate provision of educational services in the country, the
government of Malawi, together with its development partners, formulated a policy
investment framework, which outlines the policies and strategies for the development of the
education sector. The project will support these policies and strategies by contributing to the
improvement of the quality of secondary education provided at the community day secondary
schools. It will provide resources for the improvement of these schools’ physical facilities and
teaching/learning materials, for the training of under—qualified teachers and for strengthening
their management capacity.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN SUMMARY

Project Title: Support to Community Day Secondary Schools (Education IV Project) Project Number:
Country: Malawi
Department: OCDS Division: OCDS.3

 

a) Brief description of the project and key environmental and social components

The project aims to improve the quality of secondary education at the Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs) in the
Country. The project will focus attention on (i) infrastructure development, (ii) education materials provision, (iii) teacher
education development, and (iv) capacity building for school management.

 

b) Major environmental and social impacts
Positive Impacts:

Improved safe water drinking supply to community secondary schools and their communities;

Improved sanitation facilities through the provision of ventilated latrines;

Reduced incidence of water borne diseases like cholera, malaria, gastro-intestinal disorders, etc;

Better opportunity for girls to attend schools; and

Protection of forest resources by utilisation of stabilised soil blocks for construction instead of burned clay bricks.

Potential Negative Impacts:

0 Risk of soil disturbance during construction work; and
o Slight risk of pollution of groundwater and soil contamination.

 

c) Enhancement and mitigation program

An ESMP will be developed by the project management team and cleared by the Bank before commencement of project

physical implementation. The following mitigation measures represent the main outlines of the EMSP and will form an integral

part of the project:

0 Disturbance of soil is minimal since the scope of construction work is limited to small buildings within existing school
premises;

0 To avoid the contamination of water resources, the water points will be designed and constructed in such a way as to

ensure proper drainage of wastewater so as to prevent any chance for water stagnation, which may pose the risk of

groundwater contamination and development of breeding ground for mosquitoes, ﬂies and other insects. Such care will

minimise the transmission of water borne diseases and malaria;

0 To avoid contamination of soil and water resources from school laboratory waste, each school will be provided with a

protected waste area or small incinerator, and septic tanks will be constructed for liquid waste;

0 Efforts will also be made to train and sensitise teachers, school managers and students of the environmental health

hazards associated with water infection and poor drainage and the need to keep the facilities clean; and

0 Existing trees on all school sites will be preserved and students will be sensitised on the importance of tree planting

and protection.

 

d) Monitoring program and complementary initiatives

0 The District Education Ofﬁces will lead the environmental monitoring activities and will provide regular reporting to
the project management and MoEST; and
0 Bank supervision missions will also follow up the implementation of the ESMP.

 

e) Institutional arrangements and capacity building requirements

0 The overall responsibility for implementation of the project ESMP will rest with the MoEST. In addition,
environmental education is provided by the schools and is part of the regular curriculum.

0 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is established and will supervise the implementation of the ESMP.

 

1') Public consultations and disclosure requirements

The project is designed to operate in a participatory approach where all activities will be implemented in close
collaboration with local communities to increase their sense of ownership of the improved facilities to be introduced under
the project.

 

g) Estimated costs

All measures are mainstreamed in the project design, so that cost is integrated in the cost of different activities.

 

h) Implementation schedule and reporting

The environmental management and monitoring will be implemented following the same project schedule as all activities
