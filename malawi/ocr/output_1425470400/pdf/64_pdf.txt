1. SUMMARY ‘
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi is devastating. It is estimated that 15% of the 15 ~ 45

' years are infected, and it is feared that by year 2001 the life expectancy in Malawi will be

reduced by ten years due to AIDS. The public awareness of HIV/AIDS is widespread,
however there is still no open public debate on this issue. There is no coherent media
campaign; AIDS patients are still highly stigmatised, and AIDS and its related diseases
are rarely reported as a cause of death. Change in sexual behaviour is still limited,
condom use low and distribution of condoms remains irregular.

The increasing number of HIV positive patients and their care is a serious problem for the
hospitals in Malawi. In some hospitals HIV-positive patients occupy up to 70% of the
beds. Cost recovery is only partially introduced and hospitals have to accept a large
proportion of patients free of charge and at the same time they operate with decreasing
budgets.

Only a few centres for voluntary testing exist in the country run by NGO’s that also
provide counselling and education. Initial HIV—testing is performed in District Hospitals,
and positive results are conﬁrmed at regional level. This implies that persons tested get
their results only with long delays. The provision of HIV test kits by the National AIDS
Control Programme (NACP) is hampered due to ﬁnancial problems. Therefore only few
persons come for testing, but the demand is growing.

At present there is no national programme to ensure blood safety. The hospital based
blood banks in some districts collect blood in schools. Voluntary blood donation is still
not well accepted and constitutes less than 2 % of total collections. A system to recruit,
retain and council donors is not in place. As much as 20 —- 30% of collected blood units
from family/replacement donations and paid donors are discarded due to HIV infection.

The goal of EC health sector support in Malawi is to improve the overall health status of
the population by focusing on the key strategies of the National Health Plan. Within this
goal, and in coherence with other interventions, the present project speciﬁcally aims to
protect patients from transfusion transmitted infections including HIV, hepatitis B, and

syphilis by ensuring a safe blood supply sourced from volunteer non-remunerated regular
donors. "

The proposed ﬁve year programme (2000 ~ 2005) will in a phased manner create a
national blood transfusion service in Malawi and will assist its transformation into an

’ autonomous organisation that is technically, managerially and ﬁnancially sustainable.

The Malawi National Blood Transfusion Service (MNBTS) will ultimately meet the
needs of safe blood‘in all hospitals in Malawi through collection and screening of blood

. from voluntary, non—remunerated blood donors. The programme will implement rational

uSe of blood and safe transfusion practices at hospital level. Phase I of the programme
will have an input from the Malawi government which will increase over time and cover
30% of all costs by year 2005, which is considered realistic.

The programme outputs include: establishment of an autonomous MNBTS with an
effective and efﬁcient management system; a national supply of blood based on volunteer
donors and techniques used based on accepted standards.

The programme will be managed through the established structure for MNBTS, which
will include a MNBTS management board as well as the initial provision of an external

 

manager. A National Transfusion Advisory board will provide technical guidance to
MNBTS.

2. INTERVENTIONS

The logical framework is at annex A].

2.1. Overall objective

The overall objective is to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and other diseases

transmissible by blood in the Malawian population and to ensure the rational use of
blood.

~ 2.2. Purpose of the project

The purpose of the project is to develop a National Blood Transfusion Service in Malawi
and to ensure that it is able to provide adequate supplies of safe blood to meet the needs
of all hospitals in Malawi.

2.3. Project strategy

The project will be implemented in a phased manner, starting with the establishment of
the MNBTS headquarters in Blantyre. Appointment of senior staff members by MOI-1P

will be initiated during the ﬁrst year, and fully Operational teams for blood donor

. recruitment and mobile blood collections will be established following initial training.

Establishment of a quality assurance laboratory for disease screening will be part of the
initial phase, which will be evaluated after a 12 months period. This will allow for
necessary reprogramming of the project depending on experience gained. In view of
these initial activities, project design has not been over—prescriptive but has outlined
broad budget categories. The projected plan is to establish 2 additional regional centres in
Lilongwe and Mzuzu during the years 2 and 3 of the project.

2.4. Expected results (outputs)

(1) Establishment of the Malawi National Blood Transfusion Service as an
autonomous body with effective and efﬁcient management systems.

(2) Formulation of a national blood policy and approval of legal framework to
support policies.

(3) 80 percent of national blood needs are met by volunteer donors during year 5 of
the project. (It is recognised that this is an ambitious target)

(4) Testing of all blood units for disease markers and establishment of quality
assurance in testing.

3. IMPLEMENTATION
3.1. Physical and non-physical means

1. The project will provide one long-term technical assistant for the ﬁrst 3 years with
provision for a possible extension following the mid-term evaluation, and a pool of short-
term consultancies. The technical assistant will assist in the establishment of the MNBTS
headquarters in Blantyre, in selection and training (if staﬁ‘, formulation of policies and
elaboration of administration systems. S/he will serve as project manager and support the
MNBTS Medical Director. A pool of technical consultancies (for MNBTS and MOHP)
will be mobilised from local, regional or international sources as required (i.e. evaluation of
programme strategies. including close monitoring of already established standards for
reporting (EC); legal advise; quality insurance; health economy...)

2. The personnel for the MNBTS (110 staff) will be ﬁnanced by the MNBTS as
autonomous structure, with degressive ﬁnancial support ﬁ'om the project. The salaries
will be based on the public Servant rates with a supplementary incentive.

3. The inﬁ'astructure component will include the construction/rehabilitation of the
Blantyre MNBTS headquarter, the two regional centers in Lilongwe and Mzuzu and the
Zomba depot. The project will provide furniture and equipment for the 4 structures.

4. The project will fund activities designed to establish, manage and run the MNBTS
and to enhance management and operational capacities of the hospitals blood services:
training, study tours, some maintenance and recurrent expenses. Support to recurrent
expenses will progressively decrease whiles other ﬁnancial sources are established.

5. Reviews and external evaluation will be conducted in years 1, 3 and 5. Annual
external audits are foreseen.

3.2. Organisation and procedures

1. The implementing agency will be the MNBTS. An Interim Management Group
(IMG) will be constituted until the MNBTS is set up. The [MG will be nominated by the
MOHP and approved by the EC, and will comprise the project manager and senior local
experts in the ﬁeld of blood transfusion. The IMG will be responsible for the
advertisement and selection of the senior MNBTS staff members (medical director,
ﬁnancial administrator, national blood donors programme ofﬁcer, chief laboratory
technician and quality system manager) and the preparation of the ﬁrst work-programme.

2. The MOI-1P will create a‘National Advisory Committee to support MNBTS
during the period of establishment as an autonomous institution. This Committee, made
up of representatives of interested parties (clinicians and nurses, blood donors
associations...) will provide technical advice to the MNBTS.

3. The long-term technical assistant as well as a quota of 10 person-months for
international experts will be recruited through a contract awarded following restricted
tender procedures. Mobilisation of local and regional expertise through service contracts
under EDF rules of up to 10,000 € will be included in the annual work plan.

4. Works and supply contracts of up to 100,000 6 will be included in the annual
work plan. Supplies of up to 25,000 6 will be procured on the local market through direct
agreement on submission of three quotations. Between 25,000 E and 100,000 € supplies
will be procured through restricted tender, above 100,000 6 by open international tender.
For the works contract, until 1.000.000 e the contract will be allocated through restricted
invitation to tender. Above 1.000.000 €, the contract will procured following accelerated
procedures.

5. The procurement system for medical consumables will be established by the
MNBTS during the ﬁrst semester of the project, to ensure a sustainable and ﬂexible
procurement. A unique procurement system, compatible with the EDF regulation, will be
used for the MNBTS irrespective of the origins of the funds (Government, fees, donors).

6. The annual operational plan for the MNBTS (including all activities and ﬁnancial
resources) will serve as the basic back-up document for the elaboration of the project
annual work plan and cost estimates.
