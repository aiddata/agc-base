1. PROJECT SUMMARY

Malawi's 9th EDF NIP amounts to € 276 million (A-envelope) and is focused on transport,
agriculture and natural resources (focal sectors) and good governance as a non-focal sector.
The country is also beneﬁting from a budgetary support.

With an income of about US$ 160 per capita (2001) and a Human Development Index
ranking of 163 (1998), Malawi belongs to the group of the poorest least developed countries
in the world. External aid, most of which comes from the European Community and
Member States, accounts for 38% of the overall national budget, and for 80% of the
country’s development budget. The latest poverty headcount carried out by the Malawi
Government in 1998 established that out of the total population of 10.5 million people, 65%
live below the national poverty line).

The programme aims at facilitating and supporting the implementation of the 9th EDF CSP in
Malawi. It will provide:

a) TAF — Technical Assistance Facility - a facility for the engagement of short- to medium-
term consultants to assist in the main stages of the project cycle to ensure the effective
implementation of the National Indicative Programme and other EC programmes in favour

\of the country’s development strategy, in keeping with the objectives of the ACP-EU

Partnership Agreement. Consultants will be engaged to assist with speciﬁc tasks related to:
project identiﬁcation and design, preparation and assistance with tender procedures as well
as with evaluation and monitoring or audit where this has not been provided for in the project
itself, or the project has already been closed. These services will be provided by consultants
and/or individual experts recruited by or on behalf of the NAG in accordance with EDF

procedures, in particular Article 23.6 of Annex IV to the Cotonou Agreement. The cost of
this component will be 6.0 million Euro.

b) TSPP — Training Support for Projects & Programmes — this will ﬁnance various
educational actions such as seminars or awareness-raising activities prior to or during the
formulation of a project or programme— for example a Project Cycle Management or EDF
Procedures workshop for stakeholders in a sector identiﬁed in the NIP in accordance with
EDF procedures. The cost of this component will be 0.400 million Euro.

c) CS - Conferences and Seminars — these include: (a) more general short-term training
activities for ACP ofﬁcials and/or non-state actors on topics related either to the priorities of
the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (structural adjustment, democracy, environment, trade,
etc.) or to EDF or other EU administrative and ﬁnancial procedures and (b) participation by
ACP ofﬁcials or non-state actors in international meetings or seminars on development or
trade themes. The latter are normally organised by bodies or organisations other than the

Commission (including UN bodies) in accordance with EDF procedures. The cost of this
component will be 0.560 million Euro.

2. INTERVENTION

 

2.1 Overall objectives
The overall objectives of the programme are:

A. The implementation of the Govemment’s Development Strategy through the

support of sound development programmes ﬁnanced from the European
Development Fund (EDF).

B. The fostering of a more coherent and informed approach to development and
trade issues among key decision-makers and stakeholders in Malawi.

2.2 Project purpose

The project purpose is the identiﬁcation and implementation of actions under the NIP and
other EDF-ﬁnanced projects or programmes together with improved awareness among key
actors in Malawi of general development and trade issues and of EU policies in these areas.

2.3 Results
The programme will produce the following results:

i) The successﬁil identiﬁcation of programmes to be supported under the NIP

and other EC funded projects/programmes. Approximately 15 such exercises will be
completed during the project period.

ii) The successful forrnulation/design, monitoring (activities and ﬁnancial) and
preparation of programmes to be supported under the NIP or other EC-funded

projects/programmes. Approximately 15 such exercises will be completed during the
project period.

iii) The NAO Ofﬁce will be enabled to maintain satisfactory monitoring of — and
tendering procedures for — ongoing projects.

iv) Audits and evaluations of other projects will be ﬁnanced through this
initiative whenever they cannot be ﬁnanced out of the project itself or where it is

convenient or efﬁcient to combine a number of audits/evaluations of related
interventions.

v) Increased understanding of development and trade issues by key actors — to
this end approximately 15 conferences and seminars will have been organised in
Malawi and neighbouring countries and a further 15-20 workshops for ACP ofﬁcials
and/or non-state actors will have been ﬁnanced in more general short-term training
activities on topics related either to the priorities of the ACP-EU Partnership
Agreement (structural adjustment, democracy, environment, trade, etc.) or to EDF or
other EU administrative and ﬁnancial procedures. Another approximately 100 ACP

participants will have been ﬁnanced in conferences, seminars etc. organised by bodies
other than the Commission.

I i 2.4 Activities

7 l The programme will be principally composed of:

1. Studies and technical assistance: These will be conducted in the priority sectors
of the NIP namely:

Ii - Transport/Infrastructure
v \ - Agriculture & Natural Resources
'3 and in the non-focal sectors of the NIP namely:
f - Good Governance (including the Rule of Law) and Non-state Actors
I - Microprojects.

2. Conferences and seminars organised in the ACP countries or OCTs on EC

development and trade priorities and procedures; especially with regard to the
ongoing EU—ACP EPA negotiations.

3. Participation in training activities organised by other bodies on development
and trade issues.

The initiative will:

i) Undertake sector-wide studies aimed at focusing EDF policy in the country
(indicative programming),

.ugzga

ii) Prepare projects for funding decisions (identiﬁcation and formulation),

iii)Provide short- and medium-term technical assistance to the NAO’s ofﬁce and to
ministries or agencies concerned to establish satisfactory implementation and

monitoring of on-going projects (where this cannot be provided for in the projects
themselves or other projects)

,

iv) Support to non-state actors and civil society,

v) Evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing and completed projects (external monitoring

and evaluation) — only in cases where this is impossible as part of the projects
themselves or other projects,

vi)Perform audits of on-going and completed projects (where this cannot be provided
for in the projects themselves or in the interest of rationality),

vii) Provide short-term training courses for key Malawi participants on EDF procedures
and ﬁnancial management of EDF-funded projects,

viii) Ensure participation of Malawian participants (ACP ofﬁcials or non-state actors) in
meetings or seminars on development or trade themes or other awareness-raising
activities prior to or during the formulation of a project or programme.

2.5 Indicators

Commitment of resources available under the NIP. This will involve the Successful
identiﬁcation, formulation, implementation and evaluation of actions in the Programme.

Evaluation reports of participants on training activities attended, records of attendance at
seminars and conferences.

2.6 Lessons learned from previous projects/evaluations
Lessons learnt from previous technical cooperation and training projects in Malawi include:

0 Ownership - development of concepts and design of programmes and projects
must be done in close cooperation with stakeholders and beneﬁciaries

9 Provision of adequate human resources —- successful implementation can only be
achieved if sufﬁcient training and/or trained personnel are assigned to ministries
and projects

6 Capacity Building — apart from providing the required human resources for
project implementation, capacities of existing resources must be improved if
sustainable project management and implementation is to be secured in the long-
run .

O Flexibility — the environment in Malawi calls for a ﬂexible and pragmatic

approach in the use of such a Facility, not only in the identiﬁcation of Technical
Cooperation needs but also in the area of proj ect implementation.

2.7 Co-ordination with other donors

There is considerable overlap of interest in multilateral and bilateral donors' as well as
Member States’ programmes with the EC and mutual studies, conferences and training needs
can be combined in the preparation of future activities. This TCF, among others, will ensure
that the EC plays a major role in ensuring this compatibility with other Donor assistance,
avoiding duplication, competition and waste of scarce resources. It will facilitate the
promotion of concerted participation among development partners to tackle the enormous

cross-sectoral challenges and respective needs for technical assistance that Malawi will face
in the short- to medium-term future. ‘

Member State activities cover numerous areas of co-operation, some of which will be
complemented by activities ﬁnanced by the EDF, including support for Rule of Law, Land
Reform, agriculture and forestry programmes, etc.

3. IMPLEMENTATION
3-1 Physical and non-physical means

The programme will involve:

3) Between 250 and 300 person months of consultancy services entailing around 20-30
short- to medium-term consultancies. The Government of Malawi, as represented by the
NAG will propose terms of reference for the conduct of studies as outlined above. These
will be assessed by the Commission’s Delegation in Malawi. The Head of Delegation

 

may, in speciﬁc cases, use this facility for the preparation of terms of reference, technical
speciﬁcations and the like, in consultation with the Government of Malawr as represented

by the NAG.
Once terms of reference have been ﬁnalised and agreed, consultancy ﬁrms or individual
experts will be identiﬁed and recruited for each study or other TA contract in accordance
with EDF procedures. '

Due to the widespread availability of ACP expertise, it is expected that a large proportion
of the consultants will be ACP based. Other consultants will be drawn from EU Member

States.

(b) Rental, incidental expenses (interpretation, equipment, participation fees) and other
expenses of participants and for conferences and seminars.

3.2 Organisational and implementation procedures

The overall responsibility for the implementation of the programme lies with the NAG, who
may request the Commission to implement technical assistance contracts under Article 23.6
of Annex IV to the Cotonou Agreement.

All procurement, contracts and programmes estimates will comply with EDF procedures and
regulations.
