1. Civil Engineering Works including: earthworks, pavement layers, drainage
facilities, bridges, erosion control measures, bus bays, access roads,

relocation of utilities and traffic safety measures as well as any other
related works.

Gentlemen,

Sub: -List of Goods to be ﬁnanced from the Loan —
Procedure of Procurement

With reference to Sections 3.06 and 4.04 of the Loan Agreement
signed between us today for the financing of Thyolo - Bangula Road Project, we
attach herewith a List of Goods showing the items to be financed from the
proceeds of the Loan, the allocation for each item and the percentage of
expenditures thereon to be so ﬁnanced as the same may be amended from time
to time, such amendment shall not result in increasing the outstanding amount of
the Loan.

We conﬁrm that the proceeds of the loan will not be used in any
manner for the payment of taxes or duties imposed by the laws in force in
Malawi.

We agree that if the Fund finds that the allocation for any item is
insufﬁcient to finance the percentage specified in the List of Goods out of the
expected total cost of such item, it may take any of the following measures:

(a) To allocate for that item, within the limit of the amount necessary to cover
the shortfall in financing on the basis of the specified percentage, an
additional amount against the unallocated amount intended as a provision
for contingencies or against the allocation for any other item if the Fund
considers that there is a surplus in that allocation.

(b) To reduce the percentage to be financed from the Loan out of the total
cost of the particular item, if the additional allocation for that item, in
accordance with the foregoing, is insufﬁcient to cover the shortfall referred
to above, or if the Fund is of the opinion that it is not possible to allocate
any additional amount from the Loan for that item, so that as a
consequence of such reduction withdrawals from the Loan will continue for
ﬁnancing the cost of the goods, works or services included in that item
until the total cost thereof is covered in full.

44. 1

We also confirm that, unless otherwise agreed with the Fund, consulting
services for the supervision of the Project will be procured on the basis of
invitation for proposals from a short list of associations between
International, Malawian and Kuwaiti Consulting firms. For the selection of
such consultants, a short list of consultants will be prepared by agreement
between us so that proposals may be solicited from such consultants who
shall each satisfy the requirement of forming an association as hereinafter
set forth. The draft invitation to the consultants, the draft terms of
reference for the assignment and the draft contract for the engagements
of the consultants, who will ultimately be selected, will be presented to the
Fund for review and approval. Upon receipt of proposals from the
consultants, such proposals will be evaluated by us in accordance with
criteria agreed in advance with the Fund, and a report on such evaluation
together with the recommendation for award will be presented to the Fund
for review and approval. A consulting ﬁrm will not be regarded as having
Kuwaiti or Malawian nationality unless such firm is owned by Kuwaiti or
Malawi nationals to the extent of at least 50%.

We confirm that, except as the Fund may othen/vise agree, the
contract for the road construction will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding, with bidders being pre-qualified in advance in accordance
with such procedures as agreed between us.

Notice of the invitation to eligible contractors to apply for pre-
qualification will be published in at least one international periodical, one Kuwaiti
daily news paper and advertised locally in the Republic of Malawi, with an
advance copy of the advertisement being furnished to the Fund for its comments.
A report on the evaluation and recommendations for pre-qualification of
Contractors will be prepared and submitted to the Fund for review and approval

We also confirm that, we shall furnish to you the draft tender
documents for the construction of the Project for your comments and approval,
and we shall make such alterations in these documents or in the bidding
procedure as may be reasonably requested by you. Following receipt of the bids
the same will be evaluated with assistance of the consultant appointed for the
project. A margin preference of up to 10% will be allowed in the evaluation of
contractors of Malawians or Kuwaiti nationality or Joint Ventures between
contractors of such nationalities. For the purpose of application of the above
mentioned margin of preference a contracting firm will not be regarded as having
a Malawian or Kuwait nationality unless such firm is owned or beneficially owned
by Malawian or Kuwaiti citizen respectively to the extend of at least 50%. Upon
completion of the evaluation of bids, a detailed report on the evaluation will be
presented to the Fund together with the recommendation for award for review
and approval.

M

We understand that if we exercise, in accordance with Section 3.02
of the Loan Agreement, the option of requesting the Fund to issue any special
commitment in connection with the confirmation of any documentary letter of
credit for meeting expenditures of the Project, such request will be made on the
basis that the special commitment of the fund is to be made to a Kuwaiti Bank
operating in Kuwait or overseas.

Following the signature of any contract to be financed from the
Loan, a conformed copy thereof will be furnished to the Fund for its records and
for the purpose of disbursements from the Loan in accordance with such
contract. In case a material modification is proposed in any contract after the
approval thereof by the Fund, such proposed modification will be presented to
the Fund for review and approval.

Please indicate your agreement to the List of Goods attached
herewith and your acceptance of the contents of this letter by signing the form of
confirmation on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to us.
