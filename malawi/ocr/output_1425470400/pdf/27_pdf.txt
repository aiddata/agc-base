ANNEX I
AGREED PROGRAMME SUMMARY

Identification of the Programme

GCPS/MLW/O30/NOR “Enhancing Food Security and

Developing Sustainable Rural Livelihoods” in Malawi

Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United

Nations (FAO)

- Partner institutions: — Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security

— Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development

— Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development

- Project Symbol/Title:

- Executing Agency

Description of the Programme

Goal — Development objective

The overall purpose of this project is to support the efforts of Government in implementing
its Food and Nutrition Security programme and mitigate the food crisis facing the many
vulnerable households in Malawi.

Purpose — The primary objective of the project is:

“To alleviate the immediate problems of poverty and food security amongst the resource
poor rural households, addressing their needs by better water control and the sustainable
use of the environment”

The project aims at providing small scale farm households with less than 2 hectares of land
with the means to increase food production and generate income opportunities. The focus of
the project is on water control, the support of production increases in rainfed cropping and
income generation through crop and livestock diversification.

Objectives - the overall development goal of the project will be supported by the following

specific immediate objectives.

- to extend the area under small
management,

- to improve incomes and social conditions of rural communities through intensification
and diversification of farm production,

- to facilitate capacity building and institutional strengthening at district and community
levels.

scale irrigation, water control and watershed

Expected outputs.

- improved on-farm productivity through rehabilitation and development of small scale
irrigation and the design of improved agricultural practices

- improved food security in terms of availability of food crops and access to food.

- a broadened the range of income generating options particularly for vulnerable
households.

- reduced rate of land degradation, soil erosion and deforestation through the sustainable
use of the natural resource base.

- emergence of self—sustaining communities and self help groups including women, and
marginal farmers contributing to resource mobilisation and capital formation.

- improved wellbeing of women through providing income opportunities, employment and
reducing labour demands.

- strengthened capacities of rural community members and village extension workers.

Inputs

 

For effective implementation the project will require equipment such as vehicles, computers
and irrigation equipment. In addition the project will require logistic supports in form of
office space and communication.

One of the main challenges of the project will be the broad range of expertise required for
farmer and extension workers to effectively implement the project. The project will therefore

rely on regular supervisory technical support services (STS) from FAO, Government
departments and NGOs.

As the project aims to ensure self reliance among the rural communities the provision of

physical inputs to farmers will be essential. In this connection inputs in form of labour and
technical know—how will be required.

The sum of 33 million NOK will be required to finance programme activities. The contribution

of the government of Malawi shall be in the form of staff time, office space and ofﬁce
equipment, whilst FAQ will provide a limited number of equipment (mostly vehicles).
