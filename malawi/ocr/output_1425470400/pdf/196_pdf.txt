B. Project Objectives [from section 2 0f PCN]
The overall objective of this program is to assist the Government of Malawi to implement the
National Education Sector Plan— NESP (2010—2012) by:

(i) Promoting access and equity in basic education;

(ii) Enhancing the quality of teaching and learning; and

(iii) Strengthening the overall managerial capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science
and Technology (MoEST).

C. Project Description [from section 3 0f PCN]
Component I: Access and Equity to Basic Education

(i) School construction/rehabilitation, including girls latrines, girls’ hostels, and houses for head
teachers in selected rural schools. About 2000 new classrooms for basic and secondary
education will be built, 500 will be rehabilitated, and 250 head teachers’ houses will be provided.
Construction/rehabilitation will include Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSS) and

Teacher Development Centers (TDCs). This subcomponent includes provision of the required
furniture.

(ii) The project will finance locally appropriate interventions to enhance gender equity and
protect vulnerable children. These will specifically build on successful interventions that are
currently being piloted for future scale—up, including: (1) incentive programs for teachers,
specifically women, to work in rural areas; and (2) cash and in—kind transfers for girls and
vulnerable children.

Component II: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning

The objective of this component is to improve the learning conditions as well as the quality of
the service delivered by supporting the following activities: (i) Provision of textbooks and
learning materials to all students enrolled in Basic and secondary schools; (ii) In—service as well
as pre—service teacher training activities including the designing of non—conventional strategies
that will guarantee within a few years a qualified group of teachers; (iii) Design during the first
year of implementation of a non formal early childhood education program to be carried out
during the following years.

Component III: Improved Management Capacity &Institutional Development

Issues of management, accountability, inspection, quality assurance and monitoring across the
system are central elements in improving efficiency. These will need to be addressed within the
framework of decentralization, community involvement and through redefining the roles of the
Ministry and districts in improving overall service delivery in the following areas: strengthening
decentralization management by provision of continued assistance to the Direct Support to
Schools Program; building capacity in Monitoring and Evaluation to ensure better planning,
targeting, and feedback to relevant stakeholders and timely decision—making; building capacity in
Budgeting and Planning aiming to develop FM, reporting and procurement procedures for the
implementation of the SWAP; support to implementation of the Local Development Fund (LDF)
mechanism. National LDF is an Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System designed to
harmonize planning, financing, implementation and monitoring of results in service delivery
both at central and local government levels. Over time it is expected that all community focused
activities, such as school construction and maintenance, will be funded through the LDF.

D. Project location (if known)

This is a country—wide program that will focus on the national, provincial, district and school
level educational system. Students and teachers in urban and rural schools will benefit from
different project interventions.

E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]

Environmental and Social Assessment: The borrower has illustrated sufficient capacity for
handling both social and environmental safeguard issues during implementation of the on—going
Education Project financed by IDA. Government (MoEST) has been closely following the
recommendations established in the environmental and social assessment conducted as part of
the safeguard documentation required during project preparation. Additionally, since the

implementation of the NESP includes the construction/rehabilitation of schools, the Ministry of
Education Science and Technology has already updated both the Environmental and Social
Management Framework—ESMF and the Resettlement Policy Framework—RPF in order to cover
additional potential adverse environmental and social impacts as a result of the additional
activities.

School construction and refurbishment will be supervised by the Education Infrastructure
Management Unit (EIMU), which is part of the MoEST. The previous construction
implementation units managed by Dle and AfDB will now be managed by the EIMU, with
DFID and AfDB covering the recurrent costs of EIMU for three years (from September 2008).
Previously the construction unit supported by Dle has undertaken the majority of school
construction works (e. g., classrooms, teacher houses, sanitation facilities) in the basic education
sector for the MoEST since 2003. They have built an average of 700— 800 classrooms per year (8
classrooms per school). The AfDB supported construction unit has undertaken the majority of
secondary construction works over a similar period of time. All construction work undertaken to
date adheres to universally—approved specifications for latrines, disability accessibility, Malawi
environmental legislation, and social and environmental safeguards.

The ESMF has been prepared in recognition of the fact that Malawi’s Guidelines for
Environmental Impact Assessment (December 1997) do not include a tool for the identification
and mitigation of potential environmental and social impacts of construction and rehabilitation
activities under education projects. Potential impacts such as soil erosion, water pollution, loss of
vegetation or loss of livelihoods most likely would fall below the thresholds at which EIA is
mandatory. The ESMF provides environmental guidelines for contractors, environmental and
social checklists, as well as a summary of World bank safeguard policies.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered Yes No TBD

 

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) X

 

 

 

 

This policy is triggered because it is envisaged that the school construction may cause
adverse environmental and social impacts such as soil and water pollution, soil erosion, and loss
of vegetation. An ESMF has been prepared that provides mitigation measures for such impacts.
Once completed, it will be publicly disclosed both in—country and at the InfoShop prior to
Appraisal.

 

Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)

 

Forests (OP/BP 4.36)

 

Pest Management (OP 4.09)

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) X

 

 

This policy has been triggered because of the proposed construction works in component 1

girls’ hostels, and houses for head teachers in selected rural schools. About 2000 new classrooms
for basic and secondary education will be built, 500 will be rehabilitated, and 250 head teachers’
houses will be provided. Construction/rehabilitation will include Community Day Secondary
Schools (CDSS) and Teacher Development Centers (TDCs). Such planned public works may
likely lead to the involuntary taking of land resulting in direct or indirect economic and social
impacts caused by loss of benefits from use of such land; relocation or loss of shelter; loss of
assets or access to assets; or loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the
displaced persons has moved to another location. Because the physical locations of the proposed
sites are still unknown, the Borrower has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
which will be publicly disclosed both in—country and at the InfoShop prior to Appraisal.
