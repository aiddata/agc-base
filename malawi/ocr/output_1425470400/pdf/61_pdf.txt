1. SUMMARY

The present Project has been designed to support the objectives of the newly drafted Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) where the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy
(MPRS) and the Malawi Economic Growth Strategy (MEGS) are merged. This strategy is
based on the premise that poverty cannot be reduced without economic growth and
development. One of the pillars of this policy is Good Governance as a prerequisite for growth
and poverty reduction. Political will is rated as an essential pre-condition as well as a
supportive legal/regulatory framework for private sector investment, trade and growth. The
policy includes the ﬁght against corrupt practices; improved accountability and service delivery
at the local level through decentralization; development of a strong justice system and the rule
of law; and the establishment of an institutional setting for good corporate governance. Speciﬁc
means to achieve the aims of this policy include strengthening the role of civil society in
ensuring good governance; the protection of human rights; equal access to justice; improved
legislative framework and service delivery to promote investment and local industries;
corporate governance; and an accountable and transparent public sector management.

In the same line, the independent report on the Evaluation of the EC’s Country Strategy for
Malawi, dated September 2003, recommended the reorientation of future cooperation to
democratic governance and accountability as the overarching theme of the EU’s strategy for the
country (CSP). This was supported by the Joint Mid-Term Review of EU policies in Malawi,
carried out in October 2004, where the Government welcomed the recommendation to increase
the resources allocated to the non-focal sectors of good governance and civic education.

The EC has been funding two projects in the Good Governance sector: the Rule of Law and
Improvement of Justice Project (RoLP) and the National Initiative for Civic and Voters
Education (NICE). The present Project builds on the positive results and best practices
achieved under these projects and provide opportunities to address areas for improvement.

The 2003 evaluation report of the current RoLP concluded that investing in a system of justice
which is recognised as fair, efﬁcient and accessible, is an essential cornerstone for a thriving
democracy as well as for the proper functioning of markets and private sector investment. It
also alluded to the necessity of engaging more proactively with civil society and avoiding the
misleading assumption that there is sufﬁciently widespread understanding of democratic,
constitutional and legal norms by the citizens. Civic education, through NICE, should provide a
channel to make the roles of the legal institutions better known and to bring them nearer to the
people. This is also in line with the conclusions of the Mid-Term Evaluation of the EU’s
strategy for Malawi that highlighted the need to strengthen coordination of good governance
activities.

The Project, therefore, aims to strengthen the democratic process and good governance in
Malawi by supporting the legal and judicial systems, improving accountability and
transparency in public institutions and providing information and access to justice and to
human, economic and social rights to the majority of the largely rural population, as a basis to
achieve economic growth and poverty reduction.

Since there is no sector—wide approach established, the Project intends to contribute to this by
providing suitable Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Justice to act as Coordinator to

 

(Speciﬁc; Measurable; Attainable; Realistic and Timely) objectives and indicators is at heart of
this sector wide approach.

2. INTERVENTION

The Project focuses support on the improvement of the legal framework; the delivery of justice
—including by dedicated courts with judges specialized in corruption and commercial cases— to
improve the quality and speed of judgements as well as the access to effective and fair justice;
the accountability and transparency of institutions and processes, including the electoral
process; and the information and empowerment of the population to gain effective access to its
rights, including economic rights.

The goals will be achieved through a variety of measures, including institutional support and
capacity building, training, improved legal framework for economic development and the
promotion of investment; improved management systems and record-keeping, linking and
transfer of information between case-handling institutions; support to Parliament and
participation of the citizens in the decision-making process. To this end, a large civic education
component, already functioning as an independent project, has been incorporated as part of the
same programme to improve good governance and the respect of the rule of law. This project is
already well known as NICE (National Initiative for Civic & Voters Education). It has been
consistently highly rated in policy reviews and external monitoring missions of European
Commission (EC) funded programmes in Malawi and is considered a model of its kind. Since
it is agreed that civic education should be the responsibility of the State, a Task Force is being
established, led by Parliament, to provide NICE with an independent legal status. The preferred
option is to attach NICE to an already existing statutory institution, answerable to Parliament.
Therefore, the civic education component of this Project (NICE) has been designed in such a
way (separate management, budget and logframe) that it can be easily detached from the rest of
the Project when the necessary statutory arrangements for its institutionalisation are in place.

The present Project contributes towards donor coordination, both through the Ministry of
Justice, where it has been agreed to establish a Coordinator to monitor the activities of this and
other projects in the legal sector and by including a representative of the Donor’s Committee on
Governance in the Project Steering Committee. In the area of civic education, the establishment
of a Consultative Forum should also contribute to the coordination of efforts and activities.

The Project will cover 4 years with an overall ﬁnancial contribution from 9th EDF of
28,000,000 6. The main institutional partner to supervise implementation will be the Ministry
of Justice. NSAs will also have an important role, through their representation in the steering
committee of the Project and in the Consultative Forum for civic education, as well as for the
implementation of some actions through calls for proposals that can contribute to achieve the
aims of the Project.

2.1 Overall objective

The overall objective of EC support is to contribute to the strengthening of the democratic
process and the increase of good governance in Malawi for accelerated economic growth and
poverty reduction.

2.2 Project purpose

The speciﬁc purpose is to improve the legal and regulatory framework, the delivery and access
to justice, including through alternative dispute resolution methods, in order to create a suitable

 

‘ ‘ . | ‘ l

those of the most disadvantaged groups, and promoting sound governance with the
participation of citizens, encouraging and empowering them to exercise their democratic rights
and responsibilities, and to take part in the democratic decision-making process at community,

district and national level.

2.3 Expected results and activities

To meet its purpose, the Project will focus on the quality of the law and the effectiveness and
efﬁciency of legal procedures, with special attention to the revision of outdated or
unconstitutional laws and the drafting of new laws in support of the Government’s policy for
Economic Growth and Development as a basis for poverty reduction. The Project will also
promote the utilization of legal techniques to promote better decision—making in the delivery of
services. In order to achieve its purpose, the Project will need to support the development and
strengthening of the capabilities and processes of the relevant institutions. Since a crucial
condition for these efforts to bear fruit is the accessibility of justice, particular attention has

been paid to this aspect.

2.3.1 Result 1: Improved administration & access to justice and protection of fundamental
human rights for the people of Malawi

At the core of this result are measures needed to develop the judicial system to be capable of
extending the protection of law to all citizens, with special attention to the poor and those
living outside the main cities. The Project intends to address this by:

> Improving and rationalizing the court infrastructure and the availability of the necessary
‘tools of the trade’ in terms of reference materials, particularly in rural areas.

> Improving case management in case-handling institutions through the introduction of
management systems and case management procedures.

> Enhancing the professionalization of the judiciary through refresher courses, including on
new legislation, ﬁscal, banking and commercial laws, as well as on the Corrupt Practices
Act.

> Increasing the supply of qualiﬁed lawyers, magistrates and paralegals, involving primarily
the extension of accommodation at the Law Faculty so that the intake of students and
variety of courses can be increased, as well as supporting the Mpemba Staff Development
Institute to provide training for paralegals and lay magistrates.

> Expanding and strengthening the public legal aid system and use of paralegals in
protecting human rights.

> Promoting access to information by producing, acquiring and disseminating relevant
information.

> Improving respect of human rights of prisoners, reducing the remand periods for detainees,
their death rate and the incidence of diseases in prisons.

2.3.2 Result 2: Improved accountability and transparency in the conduct of public affairs
and service delivery generating greater public conﬁdence in democracy

This result derives from the recognition that transparency and accountability in the
management of state affairs is the cornerstone of sound governance. The respect of the rule of
law is decisive in promoting these ends. Thus, the emphasis is to strengthen measures that
promote sound decision-making in the delivery of public services and better compliance with
the law, particularly by public ofﬁcials, through training, and through stronger accountability
and enforcement mechanisms as well as through civic education and other lobbying techniques
to better articulate demand.

The main activities under this result include:

> Building capacity for effective investigation and prosecution of fraud and corruption cases,

in particular through support to the Ofﬁce of the Director of Public Prosecutions in its

handling of cases forwarded by the Anti-Corruption Bureau and by cooperating with

DﬂD/NORAD to complement their support to the ACE as required.

> Training of dedicated judges to deal with cases brought before them by the ACE. I

> Training of civil servants in Administrative Law and statutory provisions to improve
decision-making, transparency and accountability in all public agencies.

> Support to initiatives that contribute to answerability of public service delivery.

> Support to the Malawi Electoral Commission in accordance with needs identified in new
strategic plan being drafted, with particular emphasis of the establishment of a reliable
voters’ roll through the continuous and efﬁcient registration of voters.

> Support to democratic conduct of affairs by political parties through the new Center for
Multiparty Democracy and similar efforts not restricted to one party or to politically allied

parties.
> Civic education related to corrupt practices and the accountability and mandate of public

institutions.

> Support to the National Archives and all legal sector institutions for improved record
keeping, including coordination and exchange of information.

> Support to the development and drafting of laws and regulations, including at district
assembly’s level to comply with the decentralization policy.

2.3.3 Result 3: Improved opportunities for socio-economic advancement for all the people of
Malawi

Economic development requires enhanced conditions for domestic and foreign investment. The
initiatives, envisaged under this result, are part of a larger effort to make the legal system more
market-friendly while providing wider and fairer access to the opportunities for advancement
offered by the private sector.

The principal activities under this result include:

> Supporting local institutions responsible for promoting fair employment and labour practices
in both the public and private sectors, as well as empowering the population through
information and civic education.

> Facilitate redress to economic injustice through the support to the Industrial Relations Court.

> Streamline the hearing and sentencing of commercial cases through the establishment of
dedicated commercial courts to handle tax, banking and trade cases, including TA and
training of legal staff to improve their expertise to handle such cases.

> Support to NSA’s and govemment’s initiatives to improve implementation and knowledge
of relevant legislation and codes of practice.

> Support for advocacy and review of legislation to achieve the aims of the MGDS and the
National Decentralization Policy.

2.3.4 Result 4: Greater public conﬁdence and participation in democratic governance
realised (NICE component)

The overriding strategy for the civic education component is to contribute to behavioural
change in order to promote democracy through the participation in public decision making;
assist local efforts to participate in the solution of their own problems and decide on questions
relevant to their well-being. The inclusion of this large component should provide a means for

2.3.5 Result 5: Improved planning and coordination capacity of the Government in relation
to the rule of law and governance sector

This result has speciﬁcally been designed to provide technical support to the Ministry of Justice
for the coordination of the activities of the Project and of the legal sector as a whole. To this
end, it is intended that TA to achieve this result should be provided by a high calibre expert
with relevant background and experience, who can be respected and accepted by the
beneﬁciary institutions. This is considered essential to ensure local ownership, contribute to a
future SWAP and intemalise core activities upon expiry of the Project.

The principal activities under this result include:

-> Support for Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation, taking into account gender
disaggregated data.

> Support for donor coordination by government towards a sector-wide approach.

> Support to carry out relevant thematic studies and surveys.

> Technical support to set up an integrated management information system for the justice and

legal sector.
2.4 Expected results and activities under Result 4 (civic education or NICE component)

The current Project known as NICE (the civic education component) will ensure its credibility
to coordinate and play a lead role in civic education by becoming an independent and truly
Malawian organisation, with a clear legal status. It is a precondition of the third phase that a
decision is taken for the institutionalisation of civic education, a proposal already agreed at
Cabinet level in 1999 but not acted upon. To this end, a Task Force, led by the Clerk of
Parliament, should reach agreement on the future legal status of NICE before the present
Project is implemented, with full institutionalisation expected during the period of
implementation of the Financing Agreement, including drafting any legislation, memorandum
of agreement or other documentation required. To avoid creating more institutions, the aim is
to attach NICE to one of the existing constitutional bodies and make it answerable to
Parliament.

Once the new status and identity are determined, NICE will design and implement a public
relations strategy to increase and maintain awareness and understanding of NICE’s identity,
policy and activities.

To contribute to its future sustainability, NICE’s internal organisation will be enhanced to
ensure it has the capacity to play a central role in civic education and to improve the quality of
the implementation of the programme. Efforts will be made to improve NICE’s status amongst

The rapid growth of NICE in recent years calls for greater attention to a number of
organisational and managerial areas.

Human resources development and management

Human resource management and development will be improved to ensure that the quality and
motivation of all staff, including Zone Coordinators and Para Civic Educators (PCEs) is
maintained. To achieve this, a number of policies, procedures and manuals in the ﬁeld of
human resource management and development will be designed and implemented, While
existing policies and procedures will be reinforced. To achieve this, the following will be

undertaken:

> The current, informal grievance procedure (using an internal Ombudsman) will be
formalised, written out and shared with all staff. This procedure will be revised from time
to time and amended as necessary.

> A staff retention policy that will include upward mobility and may include job rotation will
be developed.

> Performance-based staff assessment procedures will be implemented

> Job descriptions for all staff (including Zone Coordinators and PCEs) will be developed
and revised annually to ensure that they remain relevant and accurately reﬂect current
tasks, functions and responsibilities.

> A disciplinary policy, including procedures, will be developed and implemented in
accordance with the Bill of Rights in the Malawian Constitution, especially the rights to
equality, fair labour practices and administrative justice.

> A gender policy will be developed and implemented, with the objective of increasing the
percentage of female District Education Ofﬁcers (DCEOs) from the current 17% to 30%
over the Project’s life (in line with the Southern Aﬁican Development Community’s target
for women MPs), and to increase the percentage of women at all levels, including
management positions at national and regional ofﬁces, Zone Coordinators and PCEs.

> A disability policy will be developed and implemented.

> A policy on dealing with HIV/Aids in the workplace will be developed and implemented,
in compliance with guidelines developed by the International Labour Organisation and
with the National Aids Policy.

> Teambuilding activities, internal communication (vertical and horizontal) and exchange of
experience will be enhanced, including through the use of electronic communication where
appropriate.

Result 2. Networking and cooperation with other role-players and stakeholders in the area of

civic education at national and district level is increased

 

To build bridges and cooperation amongst all roleplayers, NICE will establish a consultative
donors, relevant government

forum involving representatives of civil society and NGOs,
agencies and constitutional bodies. The forum will convene at least twice a year and have a
minimum of 10 permanent members. The forum will discuss priorities in civic education,
encourage uniﬁed messages and approaches and efﬁcient use of resources. NICE will ensure

regular feedback to the forum on how their suggestions and recommendations have been used.

This approach will lead to increased partnerships between NICE and other roleplayers, with
NICE able to facilitate the process through resources available to it and through its
considerable outreach. NICE will provide services to the sector, as identiﬁed by the
consultative forum, such as a NGO database, directory of publications and a referral (signpost)
role of district ofﬁces, that will assist clients with application forms of referred institutions,
with particular attention to those of the legal sector, including the Human Rights Commission
and the Ombudsman, as well as other case handling institutions.

Using its own resources, NICE will conduct joint civic education activities with other role-
players at district and national level. In this way other organisations will be able to beneﬁt from
NICE’s resources though NICE should not act as a grant administrating organisation. This will
also increase outreach, ensure coordinated and agreed messages are delivered and contribute to
capacity building within CSOs to deliver on their mandates. To ensure that cooperation is
clearly understood by all cooperating partners, memoranda of understanding or contracts will
be developed and signed between NICE and other roleplayers as appropriate (but with at least
30 NSAs over the period of implementation of the present Project).

 

 

Result 3. A broad base of Malawian civil society organisations is capable of engaging
themselves in activities that ensure citizens participation in decisions affecting them and their
development, and to raise and manage funds to do so.

Training on civic education messages and methods, and on resource-mobilisation (such as
training on drafting funding proposals and identifying potential funders) will be provided to
build capacity within civil society organisations (NGOs at the national level, and CBOs and
other roleplayers at the district level) and joint activities, using NICE’s funds, will be
undertaken to allow CSOs to implement their activities (as set out above).

 

 

 

 

. ‘ - u 1 0

National training and capacity building

To build capacity of NGOs at the national level, NGOs will be invited to attend similar training
as received by NICE personnel. This training will include civic and voter education content and
methods, ﬁnancial controls, accountancy for NGOs, strategic management, resource
mobilisation (including drafting funding proposals), gender sensitivity and related topics.
Training on training and facilitation skills will enable NGOs to conduct civic and voter
education, as well as to train others to do so. Where possible, efforts will be made to use
training experts from within the same NSAs to provide this training, substantially reducing the
need for trainers from outside Malawi.

District training and capacity building

At the district level, NICE will design and implement training and other capacity building and
support activities for Traditional Authorities, religious leaders, CBOs and other role-players.
This will be delivered by the District ofﬁcer, who will also advise local CBOs and other groups
on civic and voter education issues.

Selection of trainers

Trainers selected to train NICE personnel and members of civil society as trainers will as far as
possible be Malawian, but the determining selection criteria will be competence. Where foreign
trainers are used, efforts must be made to ensure that their knowledge and skills are transferred
to Malawians to conduct this training in future.

 

 

Result 4. Duty bearers and Malawian citizens have increased awareness and understanding of
principles and values of a democratic society. Duty bearers have become more accountable
towards the public, and citizens are better able to hold duty bearers to account for their
performance.

 

Together with other roleplayers, NICE will conduct community level civic and voter education
activities and campaigns using a range of methods and strategies that have proven to be
effective, such as workshops, NICE clubs, the establishment of rural libraries and provision of
radios to increase access to information. Under-utilised (though hugely effective), low cost
methods and approaches will be used, including:

> Encouraging the development of radio-listening and other clubs.

> Making far greater use of radio, including supporting and building capacity within existing
community and religious radio stations and encouraging the development of new stations.

> Ensuring debates and discussions on civic education themes take place in the media and
participating in these.

> Simple language publications in local languages and, in partnerships, contributing to the
ability of other NSAs to translate their existing materials.

> Involving business in contributing to civic education, including through the printing of civic
education messages in the packaging of their goods as is effectively done by child rights
organisations in Brazil.

Any strategies developed should however be based strictly on data provided by the ongoing
baseline study.

NICE will deliberately broaden the range of target groups for activities to include the police,
members of the media and educators in schools (amongst others) and will equip district
ofﬁcers, zone coordinators and PCEs to reach these. Reaching children and youth through
incorporation of civic education into the formal curriculum will be lobbied for and activities to

involve and empower vulnerable groups, especially women, will be undertaken. Speciﬁc
activities may be designed as well for the police, prison staff and representatives of the army.

To reduce duplication, NICE will take stock of existing civic and voter education materials and
conduct a needs analysis of additional materials for various target groups, through its PCEs,
zone coordinators and district ofﬁcers. NICE will produce materials in the language of the
speciﬁc region or district and disseminate materials through district ofﬁces, zone coordinators,

PCEs and local NGOs.

NICE Regional and District ofﬁces will continue to produce and distribute the Tilime
newsletter and to organize and conduct regional and local conferences and training for district

assemblies and traditional leaders.

As required (and in cooperation with other roleplayers), NICE will continue to provide or
facilitate adult literacy classes to improve access by community members to written civic
education resources and materials, and to allow them to more effectively monitor their elected

representatives through the print media.

 

 

Result 5. Regional (African) recognition through enhanced regional networking and co—
operation in the area of civic and voter education is increased.

 

To share experiences and learn from others, NICE will reinforce its international base by
improving its regional (African) network in the course of the implementation of the present
Project. It will endeavour to integrate itself and other NSAs into regional civic and voter
education networks and participate in exchange Visits.

To strengthen the capacity of NGOs and other civil society organisations in the region (Africa),
NICE will offer training for NGOs, CBOs and other role—players and it will produce and
circulate reports and publications to national and regional partners. Lessons learnt from
regional networking will be applied to build an international network in future phases of the
Project, if appropriate.

2.5 Indicators

The indicators are mentioned in the logical frameworks. These are currently broadly deﬁned
and will be further reﬁned following the completion of the baselines studies that are now
underway.

2.6 Lessons from past experience

The two projects that the EC has been implementing in the Good Governance sector in Malawi
are: The Rule of Law & Improvement of Justice Project (RoLP) and the National Initiative for
Civic and Voters Education (NICE). Both started as pilot projects.

The 2003 Evaluation of the current RoLP (BIRD report) concluded that investing in a system
of justice which is recognised as fair, efﬁcient and accessible, is an essential cornerstone for a
thriving democracy as well as for the proper functioning of markets and private sector
investment. Both the BIRD Report and the Final Report of the RoLP’s External Legal Advisor
allude to the necessity of engaging more proactively with civil society and avoiding the
misleading assumption that there is a sufﬁciently widespread understanding of democratic,
constitutional and legal norms by the citizens.

This link will be established through NICE, which focuses on providing information and
training, embedding democratic values at grassroots level in urban and rural Malawi, while

NICE has been consistently highly rated in policy reviews and evaluations of EC founded
projects in Malawi. The mid term review of the Country Strategy also mentions there is strong
evidence that the programme has impacted positively on the evolution of country indicators.
Best practices of the programme have been identiﬁed: it is demand driven, has nationwide
outreach to the grassroots level, is impartial, and makes use of local approaches to raise
awareness and encourage public participation in democracy and good governance. As a result,
the overall strategy of NICE remains relevant to the current situation in Malawi.

One important lesson learnt from the current RoLP is that increasing the capacity of the main
institutions does not automatically have a meaningful impact on the majority of the population,
nor does it necessarily increase their consciousness of accountability, including those of the
legal sector. Ways to improve this aspect in future include the provision of support to
Parliament ~ which was not a beneficiary of the previous RoLP— not only as a legislative body
but also as the main oversight State institution.

All institutions must ultimately be accountable to the people, who should be informed of the
roles and duties of such institutions as well as of ways and means of redress. The Project
supports efforts, including by the institutions themselves, to make their services accessible to
the largely rural population of Malawi in support of the ongoing decentralization process,
restoring conﬁdence in democratic institutions and principles and providing effective access to
justice and the realization and protection of economic and other human rights of the citizens.
The two- pronged approach of supporting the main legal institutions (top down) and civic
education (bottom up), by linking NICE (civic education) to the RoL, should provide a major
channel to achieve this.

Different evaluations and reports of NICE underlined that its long-term sustainability would
largely depend on its ability to be embedded within the Malawian institutional landscape and
that further efforts should be displayed to build strategic partnerships with other organisations
and establish effective linkages with other government/donor projects. Following this
recommendation, the RoLP and NICE established a closer collaboration, delivering
information and access to the relevant central institutions with remarkable success. The formal
linking of NICE to the RoLP should not only contribute to provide outreach to the central legal
institutions, but also to the wider acceptance of NICE as a reliable facilitator for the delivery of
messages, using its outreach capacity and approach to communities, a balanced geographical
spread of activities —including those of other organizations- and providing a more efﬁcient and
effective use of resources in the sector.

NICE should concentrate more efforts in strengthening the capacity of local NGOs, increase
cooperation and facilitate networking and the dissemination of information. Increased
partnership at national level with organisations, institutions, donors and government
programmes engaged in civic education, and continued partnerships with Community Based
Organisations (CBOs) at the village level, will enhance Malawian ownership and improve
NICE’s role as a service provider. This should facilitate the institutionalisation of civic
education, a proposal already agreed at Cabinet level in 1999 but not yet acted upon.
Institutionalisation of NICE as a true national (instead of foreign) initiative, will increase local
ownership and contribute to a clear identity of NICE.

Delivery mechanisms for the RoLP and NICE projects have been considered pertinent and
responsive. Financial control mechanisms have been improved and are considered adequate in
earlier evaluations. Monitoring should be improved to go beyond simple quantitative
assessment to provide qualitative impact assessment based on the indicators provided by the

2.7 Complementary actions

Related EC projects have been duly taken into account in the preparation of the Project. These

are:

control systems. i _ I . . I

The United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfDD) has so far been the
main donor in the legal sector, through a large programme (£ 35 million for 7 years) known as
MaSSAJ (Malawi Safety, Security and Access to Justice) mainly focused on criminal justice
and support to the Police and Prisons Services, though with some interventions (both through
MaSSAJ and directly by DﬂD) in other areas within the legal sector. The Project will continue
and intensify cooperation with MaSSAJ, including through the revised National Council or
relevant structures established to contribute to the achievement of a sector wide approach.

The German agency GTZ, together with NORAD and UNDP, is providing support to the
decentralization policy of the Government as a means to improve governance through local
control of resources by District Assemblies and elected councillors. Efforts to establish a Local
Decentralization Fund to pool resources in support of the 2nd phase of the National
Decentralization policy are at present hampered by the lack of elected councillors and
postponement of local elections that were due to be held in May 2005.

Other donors active in the general area of Good Governance are UNDP, World Bank, Aﬁican
Development Bank, NORAD/SIDA, CIDA and USAID. Their efforts tend to concentrate on
support to ﬁnancial and fiscal management (which the EC supports under other projects) and/0r
public sector reform. Most of them allocate grants to NSAs (mainly NGOs) to carry out
activities, with additional ad hoc support to some institutions and to Parliament.

Many donors are currently evaluating their programmes and it is likely that a strong interest in
Good Governance will be maintained.

There are no sector-speciﬁc Government programmes, although Malawi’s accession to
NEPAD’s peer review mechanism, currently underway, is closely related to the objectives and
results of the Project.

2.8 Donor coordination

Donors’ coordination has so far been rather weak though it has been improved through
renewed efforts in the donors’ Committee on Governance. Certain donors are beginning to
promote ‘basket funding’ for some Government institutions and policies in the sector. These
include support to Parliament, Anti-Corruption Bureau, Electoral Commission, decentralization
policy and common efforts by political parties to achieve internal democracy. In this context, a
Center for Multiparty Democracy sponsored by the Institute for Multiparty Democracy of the
Netherlands has recently been established and should provide a channel for coordinated multi-
party funding. Though the realisation of ‘basket funding’ still needs further reﬁnement in order
to be achieved, the intentions of the donors are hinting at the potential of a Sector Wide
Approach Policy (SWAP), which could eventually be introduced by the Government in view of

the increasing importance attached to Good Governance. Participation in basket funding

sh a Coordinator to monitor the activities of this and
other projects in the legal sector and by including a representative of the Donor’s Committee on
Governance in the Project Steering Committee. In the area of ciV1c education, the establishment
of a Consultative Forum should also contribute to the coordination of efforts and act1v1t1es.

The fact that the UK and the EU have the largest and most comprehensive programmes in the

legal sector will facilitate the coordination of efforts. To this end, a review of the National
Council for Safety and Justice and other mechanisms set up by MaSSAJ with the aim ofpav1ng
the way for a sector-Wide approach is under way, in close consultation with the EU Delegation,
so that efforts should be coordinated through common structures. The German agency GTZ
will also be associated and consulted since it has meaningful interventions in related areas,
such as conﬂict resolution and, particularly, the decentralization process.

3. ORGANISATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES

3,1 Physical and non-physical means

The Project will be implemented by means of decentralized management with the Government
of Malawi, in accordance with the conditions set out in the Cotonou Agreement. The
contracting authority for the Project shall be the National Authorising Ofﬁcer (NAO) for the
European Development Fund (EDF) at the Ministry of Finance. Long term Technical
Assistance, responsible for setting up a Technical Facilitation Unit (TFU) will be engaged to
implement the Project in close coordination and under the supervision of the Ministry of
Justice. However, the civic education component (NICE) will be directly implemented by the
NAG through a Project Manager responsible for the day to day running of NICE. External
(short term) technical assistance is foreseen to assist with certain activities, as necessary.
Rehabilitation of magistrates’ courts shall be carried out, Whenever feasible, by the local
communities as an income generating activity. An organization chart of the Project is attached
as well as an organogram representing the structure of NICE.

Steering Committee

A Steering Committee will be set up to oversee and validate the overall direction and policy of
the Project. The Steering Committee shall meet at least every two months. It shall be
responsible for verifying the project estimates drawn up by the Project management and
implementation and by the imprest administrator and the imprest accounting ofﬁcer in the case

of NICE.

Although the composition of the Steering Committee may vary over time, it shall not exceed 12
members to allow meaningful dialogue. It shall be made up of:

Permanent members
0 A representative of the National Authorising Ofﬁcer, the contracting authority
A representative of the Ministry of Justice, the supervisor,
A representative of the Parliament
A representative of the Judiciary
A representative of the Faculty of Law of the University of Malawi
A representative of the Law Commission

Delegation)

o The Coordinator of the Minister of Justice.

Thematic meetings may be held on speciﬁc issues, inviting other relevant bodies or
stakeholders, depending on the subject to be discussed.

Consultative Forum for civic education

A Consultative Forum for Civic Education will be established, made up of representatives of
civil society and NGOs, donors, Parliament (including representatives from the different
parties), relevant government agencies and constitutional bodies. The forum will convene at
least twice a year and have a minimum of 10 permanent members. The primary role of the
forum is advisory — it will discuss priorities in civic education, encourage uniﬁed messages and
approaches and efﬁcient use of resources. Its structure and role will be dependent on the status
agreed for NICE and will need to be clearly spelled out in any founding documentation.

3.2 Organisation and responsibilities

The overall responsibility for the implementation of the Project lies with the National
Authorising Ofﬁcer, on behalf of whom the Technical Facilitation Unit (TFU) and the civic
education (NICE) manager are responsible for managing and executing the Project. The
Ministry of Justice will be the Supervisor of the Project and will ensure coordination of its

activities.

A Technical Facilitation Unit under extemalised direct labour will be engaged by service
contract awarded by the 9th EDF rules to manage the Project on behalf of the NAG, excluding
the NICE component that will continue to be managed as a direct labour operation by the NAG.

For the direct labour part (civic education component) an imprest administrator and an imprest
accounting ofﬁcer shall be assigned to the management and implementation of the project by
the NAG, in agreement with the Head of Delegation.

For the extemalised direct labour part, the management and implementation of the project shall
be carried out by a third-party organisation to which a service contract will be awarded in
accordance with 9th EDF procurement rules. This service contract must explicitly designate the
two persons who will take on the duties of authorisation (imprest administrator) and payment
(imprest accounting ofﬁcer).

The TFU will be responsible for the technical and administrative implementation of the RoL
component, as well as for its internal monitoring and evaluation, provision of reports and
drawing up of annual programme-estimates, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Justice as

Manager of NICE will have similar responsibilities regardin
the Project.

The service contract must explicitly designate the two persons on the duties of authorisation
(imprest administrator) and payment (imprest accounting ofﬁcer). There must be no form of
subordination between the imprest administrator and imprest accounting ofﬁcer in the exercise
of their duties. Their responsibilities are speciﬁed under the articles 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 of the
Practical Guide to the Management of Direct Labour Operations and Programme Estimates
ﬁnanced by the EDF. The imprest administrator/s and the imprest accounting ofﬁcer/s, in
accordance with the powers delegated to them by the NAO, shall draw up and implement
consecutive programme estimates, award contracts and grants, commit expenditure and make
the corresponding payments.

Close cooperation will be established between the TFU, where a speciﬁc member of the staff
shall be designated to coordinate civic education and related information activities, and the
manager or deputy manager of NICE. Regular meetings shall be held between the two parties,
as often as required and, at least, at monthly intervals.

The imprest administrator/s and the imprest accounting ofﬁcer/s, under the supervision of the
Ministry of Justice, shall submit their technical and ﬁnancial reports to the Project Steering
Committee, to the NAO and to the Head of the EU Delegation.

3.3 Rules of procedure

The preparation, management and implementation of the Project programme estimates must
comply with the rules and procedures as set out in the “Practical Guide to Management of
Direct Labour Operations and Programme Estimates Financed by the European Development

Fund (EDF)”.
The detail of the powers delegated to the administrator appointed by the NAO for concluding
contracts are speciﬁed in Annex 12 of the above mentioned Practical Guide.

The programme cost estimates must be approved by the NAO and endorsed by the European
Commission before they are implemented.

Annual consecutive “operational” programme estimates for one year and without any
overlapping of dates will be drawn up. The last operational programme estimate shall be for a
duration of maximum eighteen months allowing for a closure period of six months.

Except for audits and ﬁnal evaluation contracts, all other contracts cannot have a duration
which goes beyond the operational implementation phase of the ﬁnancing agreement.

3.6 Audit

The Project accounts will be audited quarterly.

Audits must be carried out by approved auditors who are members of an internationally
recognised auditing and certiﬁcation association, and who should verify the Pr0ject accounts

and certify that the expenditure by the direct labour component of the programme estimates

was committed, validated and paid in accordance with the programme estimate, the budget

estimate and the technical and administrative implementing arrangements for the corresponding
programme estimate, the EDF procedures for awarding contracts and grants, the rules of the
practical guide to management of direct labour operations and programme estimates ﬁnanced

by the EDF and generally accepted accounting principles.

Audits may also be conducted on the systems and procedures used if needed. Contracts for
audits should always be ﬁnanced by speciﬁc commitments.

Provisions for audits are foreseen in the budget of this Project. Audit contracts will be
concluded by the Commission, acting for and on behalf of the ACP State concerned. The
Project accounts will be audited annually. The Chief Authorising Ofﬁcer, in accordance with
Art. 23 of the Financial Regulation, may use this provision to organise an independent audit of

expenditure realised under this programme.

3.7 Timetable

The Financing Agreement shall be concluded by 31 December of the year following the year in
which the global ﬁnancial commitment was adopted. Failing this, the corresponding
appropriation shall be cancelled. The end of the period of execution of the Financing
Agreement is hereby set at 31 December 2011. The operational duration of the Project is set for
48 months. The ﬁnal date for operational implementation shall be the 31 December 2009. Any
balance of funds remaining available under the EC grant shall be automatically cancelled 6
months after the end of the period of execution of the Financing Agreement.

Contracts and programme estimates must be signed by both parties no later than three years
from the date of the corresponding global ﬁnancial commitment. This deadline cannot be
extended. The aforementioned provision does not apply to contracts relating to audit and
evaluation, which may be signed later.

4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

4.1 Performance monitoring

Indicators are shown in the logical frameworks annexed. These will be monitored, evaluated
and reﬁned following the ongoing baseline studies and/or those further developed for the needs
of the Project. NICE will be strengthened to allow for efﬁcient management and reporting of
activities.

Quarterly reports which cover progress and monitoring of the project will be submitted to the
NAG and the Ministry of Justice, with a copy to the EC Delegation. Such reports will be
provided by the managers of the Project and will be subject to review by the PSC. Performance
will also be monitored as part of the GoM and EU Joint Annual Review process.

 

. n
l ;

4.2 Evaluation

Progress on the implementation of the project will be monitored by the NAG and the EC
Delegation.

A mid term evaluation will be conducted after 24 months; a ﬁnal evaluation will take place
after 45 months.

The results of the mid-term evaluation will provide guidance to the NAG and the EC about any
possible remedial action which may need to be taken for the remainder of the project. It will
pay speciﬁc attention to the management of the Project and provide advice on further
employment of international TA, in particular for the NICE component. The ﬁnal evaluation

will provide recommendations on a potential follow-up Project.
An impact evaluation will be carried out at the end of the Project to measure its effectiveness.

Provisions for these evaluations are foreseen in the budget of the Project. Evaluation contracts
and framework contracts are always concluded by the Commission acting for and on behalf of

the NAO.

ANNEX 5b

Speciﬁc implementation method for the civic and voters education component

To ‘Malawianise’ the structure and nature of NICE, and to improve effectiveness, additional positions
within NICE will need to be created, depending on the availability of funds. An organigram
representing the optimal structure of NICE is attached as Annexure F. As will be seen from the
budget, two options exist — of these, the ﬁrst indicates the cost for the ‘minimum requirements’ for
NICE, while the second indicates the cost of the complete optimal structure. Of the positions listed:

0 All at the national level will be ﬁlled at the beginning of the project, save for the position of
Research, Documentation and Publications Ofﬁcer (which will be ﬁlled as and when sufﬁc1ent

funds are available.

0 No changes will be made at the regional level until such times as funds are available. Then, three
new regional ofﬁces will be established — phased in over the period of the new phase.

0 The district level will remain substantially unchanged, except that 100 trained Zone Coordinators,
paid minimal salaries and with little equipment, are in place and the number of unpaid PCEs is
reduced to approximately 5000. Should sufﬁcient funds be available, an additional eight District

Civic Education Ofﬁcers (DCEO) will be appointed.

NICE is overseen by a Steering Committee, made up of representatives of government and non-state
actors mSAs). Although the composition of the Steering Committee may vary depending on the legal
status chosen (and will change over time), it should not exceed ten members.

The positions of both Project Manager (PM) and Head of Finance and Administration
(HEFINA) will be held by Malawians. The PM will receive technical assistance for 6 months
during the ﬁrst year, and three months in each of the following two years from either one or a
variety of Technical Advisers, depending on the identiﬁed needs. The HEFINA will be
assisted for the same periods each year by a ﬁrm of auditors, identiﬁed through a tender

process.

NICE will have the overall responsibility for implementation of the project, on behalf of the National
Authorising ofﬁcer and in accordance with the overall EDF procedures, advised by a Steering

Committee with the roles set out in Annexure C.

The current structure at the regional level is maintained essentially as during the second phase, save
that it is made clearer that the Regional Civic Education Ofﬁcer (RCEO) is the head of the ofﬁce;
regions are divided into six rather than three and three new RCEOs are appointed over time (one per
year), if sufﬁcient budget is available. New ofﬁces space and equipment will be required.

At the district level, DCEOs remain the key managers and implementers of activities.

To improve and strengthen accounting and ﬁnancial reporting and control at district level, District
Financial Ofﬁcer, reporting to Regional Accounts and Financial Ofﬁcers, will be appointed, each with
the responsibility of assisting three or more DCEOs as appropriate. This will increase transparency
and accountability and allow the DCEOs to focus more of their time and efforts on their core tasks

and responsibilities.

Approximately 100 Zone Coordinators, selected on the basis of their aptitude and skills in civic
education whilst engaged as PCEs, will be responsible for co-ordinating activities in their zones
(made up of numerous villages). These will operate out of the rural libraries established by
communities and will be provided with minimal salaries and equipment. They will be assisted by
unpaid PCEs who will continue to provide assistance at the village level.
