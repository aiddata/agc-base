SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT

Most of Malawi’s population is working in the primary sector and agriculture is the mainstay
of the economy. Agriculture accounts for a large share of national output and exports of
agricultural products are the principal foreign exchange earners. It is clear that the great
dependence on this sector of the economy represents a yearly challenge for the country. As a
mean of diversifying the Malawi economy, the tourism industry has been accorded priority,
since it offers a good potential for the development of the country both as a foreign exchange
earner and for provision of employment. Tourism is seen as a major vehicle to the poverty
alleviation programme since it offers an alternative source ofincome.

The Southern part of the Lake Malawi is the major tourist attraction with Lake Malawi
National Park declared a world heritage site by the UNESCO. More than one half of the
tourists that visit Malawi visit the Mangochi, Monkey Bay area

The existing route between M1, south of Dedza, and Monkey Bay, via Golomoti is composed
by two sections :

- Ml-Golomoti earth road, which has about 5 m wide carriageway and no shoulders ;
- Golomoti—Monkey Bay paved road with about 6 m wide bitumen pavement and gravel
shoulders 1.5 m each used by pedestrians and for stopping vehicles.

The full route deteriorated quickly due to high levels of overloaded goods trucks, lack of
adequate maintenance and drainage problems. As a result, the two roads (especially the first
section Ml—Golomoti) are no longer easily accessible to all categories of vehicle, and for the
remaining potential users, vehicle operating costs have increased so considerably that often
they prefer to choose a longer route instead of the project roads.

The project’s purpose is to re-establish a permanent access route, by the
rehabilitation/constmction of the two project roads to an all weather bitumen standard from
Ml, south of Dedza, to the Monkey Bay turn off on the southern lake-shore. The area will
thus beneﬁt from year-round access. The resulting reduced journey times in more comfortable
conditions should lower vehicle operating and therefore transport costs.

Implementation of the works will be undertaken by an international contractor appointed after
an open tender process. A ﬁrm of experienced consulting engineers will supervise the
construction. The planned duration of the rehabilitation/constmction works is 24 months.

The Government of Malawi has undertaken to ensure that land will be acquired and services
moved in time for construction. Any related costs will be met out of the national budget. The
Government has also undertaken to ensure that sufﬁcient funds are made available for future
road maintenance through a dedicated Road Fund to be managed by the National Road
Authority under Board comprising stakeholders and the private sector.

As the rehabilitated roads substantially follow the existing alignment, the environmental
impact will be minimal. An Environmental Analysis has been carried out with a View t

minimising environmental impacts, particularly during construction. ‘

The total project cost is estimated at 18 Million EURO, funded on the 8‘h EDF resources, of

- which :

16.245 Million EURO for works and supervision, and
1.755 Million EURO for contingencies and price escalation

The estimated economic internal rate of return for the full route (Ml-Golomoti-Monkey Bay)
is 10,18%.

INTERVENTION

OVERALL OBJECTIVES

The Government of Malawi's overall objective of poverty alleviation by improving growth
performance in economic sectors (as described in the above § 2.1) is supported by the
development of an appropriate and maintainable road transport system which, is affordable to
its users. The project roads pass through areas of underdeveloped smallholder agriculture with
the potential for improvement, and shorten the route linking the tourist zone of the Lake
Malawi to Lilongwe.

In line with the stated development priorities, the Lome IV National Indicative Programme
allocates 20 per cent of funding to agri~rural development, and, in recognition of the
importance of an effective transport system in furthering the same objective, 40 per cent of
funding is assigned to the road transport sector.

PROJECT PURPOSE

The project purpose is to provide sustainable improved access to, and road conditions in, the
South East Lake Malawi area and lower road user costs by shortening road transport distances

and travel time.. Reducing distances and journey times between Lilongwe and the southern
lakeshore area will increase the opportunity for tourism development.

RESULTS

The intervention of the European Development Fund will permit :

* rehabilitation of the Ml-Golomoti—Monkey Bay road to full width, pavement, including a
new bridge, for a total length of about 90 kilometres;

* permanent all—weather access to villages located all along the route ;

ACTIVITIES

The project involves the following activities :

- International Tendering, leading to award of the contract with suspensive clause.

~ Compensation for land acquisition for construction of the road, quarries, and location of
diversions (GOM responsibility).

— Relocation of utilities (GOM responsibility).

- Rehabilitation/construction of 90 km of paved roads, including drainage culverts and a new
concrete bridge.

- Supervision of construction by a ﬁrm of international consulting engineers, selected by
restricted tender with suspensive clause.

IMPLEMENTATION

PHYSICAL AND NON—PHYSICAL MEANS

The project would reach the above described results, by the realisation of the following
works :

Section 1 (Ml-Golomoti) : reconstruction and widening of the existing road, improvement of
the vertical and horizontal alignment, reconstmction of an existing bridge, execution of the
necessary drainage system, paving of the road along its total length and execution of vertical
and horizontal signalling system. This section has been designed as :

— Class I road, from km 0.0 to km 3.9 and from km 17.7 to km 30.4 (end of this section), and
as

- Class II road between km 3.9 and km 17.7 (This portion of road is a mountain road).

 

3.2

3.3

3.4

Class I roads are main roads with a carriageway width of 6.7 metres and shoulder width of 1.5
metres. This standard is applied to important (main) routes. Class II roads are secondary and
tertiary roads with a carriageway width of 5.5 metres and shoulder width of 1.25 metres. The
selection of the Class II type between km 3.9 and km 17.7 was made on economic grounds, in
View of the relatively low traffic volumes and the difﬁcult terrain.

_ Section 2 (Golomoti — Monkey Bay) : reconstruction and widening, where necessary, of the

existing road, execution of the necessary drainage system including several circular culverts,
paving of the road along its total length and execution of vertical and horizontal signalling
system. This section has been designed as Class 1 road.

Land-take from outside the present road boundary will be required where the route leaves the
existing alignment; this land will be made available and services, if any, will be moved as
required. A suitable qualified consulting engineering ﬁrm will supervise construction.

The Government through the National Road Authority is required to provide funding for
routine and periodic maintenance, during the life of the road.

ORGANISATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES

The Chief Executive of the National Road Authority, under which the responsibility for the
project falls, will be nominated as the Supervisor. Construction will be carried out by contract,
following an open international tender procedure, in accordance with EDF regulations. The
Government of Malawi through the National Road Authority will be assisted in the selection
of a contractor by a design consultant under an existing contract, who will carry out the tender
analysis and assist with contract negotiations. The Supervisor will be assisted in his duties by a
supervision team from an international consulting ﬁrm who will be selected by restricted
tender, in accordance with EDF regulations.

The works, from initiation until Provisional Acceptance, are expected to take 24 months. The
Final Acceptance Certiﬁcates will be issued at the end of a maintenance period of one year
from the opening of each section.

All contracts will be managed by the Contracting Authority (NAO) with the National Road
Authority as the Supervisor. Since this will be one of the first major projects to be managed
by the new institutions, support will be provided in the form of technical assistance, under the
EDF ﬁnanced Road Management Support Programme. This foresees on—the—job training of the

staff of the National Road Authority and Central Roads Agency in contract management: and
maintenance planning.

TIMETABLE

The construction period has been estimated at 24 months starting in the second half of year
2000, with the issue of the Final Completion Certiﬁcate in 2003. For the purposes of Article 3
(Duration) of the special Conditions of the Financing Agreement, the project shall start not
later than 30 June 2001 and shall end by 31 December 2004. The start up event shall be the
signature by the Contracting Authority of the ﬁrst contract.

COST AND FINANCING PLAN

The cost of the EDF funded project is estimated at 18.0 MEURO. This estimate includes an
allowance of 5 per cent for price escalation over the construction period. The cost of the
project was evaluated and updated on the basis of normal construction techniques used by
international contractors undertaking large road projects in Eastern and Southern Africa, and

4

according to rates derived from recent road construction contracts and price analysis. The cost
of supervision has been estimated on the basis of similar prejects in Malawr. Field costs
include provision for physical contingencies estimated at 5 per cent 01 the cost of the works.

SPECIAL CONDITIONS/ACCOMPANYING MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVEIINMENT

The Government of Malawi undertakes to:

i) Ensure no delay is caused to possession of the site by the contractor by completing
acquisition of all land, including that designated for quarries and horrow pits and paying
any compensation due for buildings, crops, royalties, etc according to the approved works
programme. These costs are to be paid from the National Budget.

ii) Ensure no disruption to the works due to the removal or diversion of services including
electricity, water, telecommunications, sewerage, etc. Related cost to be paid from the
National Budget.

iii) Pursue the implementation of progress, according to the approved Master Plan and its
successive modiﬁcations towards effective and efficient management of the new National
Road Authority and the Road Fund.

iv) Make provisions through the Road Fund of the National Road Authority for funds to
ensure proper maintenance of the roads in the amounts recommended in the approved
reports arising out of the RMI studies approved by Government (1997) and endorsed by
donors in the transport sector (EC, World Bank and KIW) and according to subsequent
letters of agreement with the Delegation of the European Commission - (see Annex )

v) Ensure compliance with statutory regulations, particularly with respect to axle loads.

vi) Develop a proactive stand in re—negotiating the bilateral agreements with neighbouring
countries in the SADC region to ensure full and free competition across international road
transport operation.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

DEFINITION OF INDICATORS

The increase in trafﬁc using the road and the reduction in vehicle operating costs, journey
times and accident rates, will indicate achievement of the project pulpose.

 

4.2

REVIEWS/EVALUATIONS

Project reviews will be an integral part of the works of the supervising consultants and there

is, therefore, no requirement to make special provision for these.

The evaluation will confirm baseline indicators and provide a post project evaluation one year

after the opening of the full project route. Indicators to be measured would include :

- Traffic volumes.

- Road roughness.

— Travel times.

- Updated IRR and NPV of the project based on the actual project cost and revised traffic
projections.

— Number of accidents.

 

‘Ann'cx : Tho National Roads Authority and the Road Management Support Programme

The sus‘minable”existence of thc National Roads‘Authority is dependent on scvcral factors, not
icus't ol’ which‘is a steady and dcpcndahlc source of funding. The Road Fund was establishcd far
this purpose and is protected by the National Road Authority Act (1997). The main source: of
revenue. forth: Fund is thc fuel levy (although other uscr charges Such as licencc fces will
' probably be added in future), and disburScmcnt from the Fund is strictly controlled by the Roads
Board which has a majority privat: scctor representation.

Since the. Roads Board was formed in [997, road management functions have slowly movccl
away from the Ministry of Works to thc National Roads Authority and the process should be
cornplctcd by the year 2000 after which the government will rcmin rcsponsihility only for policy
matters. The programme-of reforms, along with a commitment to incrcnsing the size of the Road
Fund over the périod between 1993/1999 to 2002/2003, has givon donors the conﬁdence to
contributc towmls the backlog maintenance costs: Road user chargcs currently account for about
60% of the total but, by 2002/2003, the full maintenance requirement of 20 h‘lEURO per annum
will be met from road uscr charges. Until suah time and, providing the government kceps to
Commitments, support is bcing provided (SAF ill and SAFIV)to'10p~up'thc furid while backlog
periodic maintenance programmes are being ﬁnanced scparatcly under donor programmCS.
including the Road Managcmcnt Support Programme.

Tovsupport the National Roads Authority in its initial years of operation, the. EDF ﬁnanccd Road
Management Suppert Progmmmc will provide valuablc ossismnccto all aspects of the

organisation.

Institutional support is lacing previded through a technical assistance team, which is helping to
establish sound management systems and procedures; and through the provision of essential

- resources including some of the vehiclcs and cquiprncnt. In addition to gcncral adminisrratior-
management systems, the assistance will extend to road network maintenance planning and
implementatiOn. Staff training will be providcd through both ‘on~tho-job’ training and through
training’institutions.‘

' The programme will provide training to the private victor to help to build up capacity to cope
with increasing workloads. This will probably be delivered through the existing Ministry of
WorksiTraining Centre: in Lilongwe.

Vehicle weighing‘stations hill be upgraded with new facilities and equipment to ensure that nxlc
- load controls are easily enforced. Those will include all border peat Stations, and thrcc inland‘
Stations to monitor local trafﬁc. The National Rear 5 Authority will assume responsibility for -
uxle load control during the coming year. .Although it may contract out the actual operation of
weighing stations, it will retain a core turn to monitor perfomiancc of this wcighing stations. The
programme will assist with training arornciais. '

Whilc thc National Road Safes! Coonoil is responsible for CO-Ordinatlng road safety programmes.
