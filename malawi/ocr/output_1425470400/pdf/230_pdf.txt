l. RATIONALE

1.1 Economic and social situation

Malawi is one of the world‘s least developed countries, ranked at 160 of the 182 countries
according to the Human Development Index 2009 of the United Nations Development
Programme. It is also a country with the highest population density in Africa (139 people/kmz)
and arapid population growth (2.8% per annum). Today the population stands at 13.1 million
and remains relatively young, with a median age of 17 years. While over 80% of the population
still lives in rural areas, Malawi has one of the world's fastest growing urban populations, with a
6% yearly rate of urbanisation. The literacy rate was 64% in 2008.

Despite recent gains in economic growth rates (7% annually between 2004-8), Malawi remains
one of the least developed countries in the region, with a per capita GDP of $265 per annum.
The poverty rate decreased from 52% to 40% between 2004 and 2008, but remained at the
same rate in 2008. The economy is largely dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about
36% of GDP as well as for more than 70% of export revenues. Overall, macroeconomic
management has been sound since 2004 when the current administration took over government,
and the average inﬂation rate has come down to a single digit (8.5% in 2009).

The estimated HIV/AIDS prevalence in adults (15 to 49 years) in Malawi is at 12%, giving a
total estimated number of 800 000 infected. adults of which 58% are women. Gender
inequalities still eXiSt in accessing productive resources, development opportunities and
decision making.

The country adopted the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) in 2006 as the
main strategic policy document designed to assist Malawi in attaining the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The main objective of the MGDS is to create wealth through
economic growth and development as a means of achieving poverty reduction. '

1.2 Sector context

Malawi’s overarching policy document is the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS), a second generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which was adopted in 2006.
The MGDS seeks to transform Malawi from a “predominately importing and consuming
country to a producing and exporting nation”. It has a very high level of national ownership and
commitment.

The principles and objectives of the EC—Malawi Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and the National
Indicative Programme (NIP), signed in December 2007 for the period 2008—2013 are aligned
and consistent with the MGDS. Furthermore these are within the scope of the principles and
objectives of European Union development policy and the European Union Strategy for Africa,
in addition to the Paris Declaration (and the European Union commitments therein), as well as
the Accra Agenda for Action.

Bothtiie Government of Malawi and the EC have been entrusted with responsibilities spelled
out indie ACP-EU Partnership Agreement for the design and implementation of the CSP and
the 10'll EDF Programme. To this end, and in accordance to Article 79 of the ACP-EU
Partnership Agreement, the European Union has established under the 9th EDF a Technical
Cooperation Facility (TCF) of EUR 8850000 one aim of which is to fund technical
cooperation requests from the Government of Malawi. The contracting period of this second
TCF facility (TCF H) ends in September 2010. The TCF 11 has become increasingly
indispensable in the identification, preparation, formulation, implementation, monitoring,
evaluation and audits of European Union funded programmes in Malawi. As such the
importance of the action being proposed in this ﬁche need not be overemphasised.

I_—--,—-—-—----

This project will be the third of this kind since 2003, and the ﬁrst speciﬁcally targeted at 10th
European Development Fund (EDF) programme formulation and implementation. The main
challenges (or problems) to be addressed through this intervention are:

(i) Lack of capacity of stakeholders in the design, formulation and implementation of
the various parts of the project cycle in European Union funded programmes.

(ii) The need for improved design, formulation, implementation, monitoring, evaluation
and audits of EC funded projects, programmes, and initiatives both in qualitative
and quantitative terms.

1.3. Lessons learnt and complementarity

One of the ﬁndings of the ﬁrst review of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS) completed in the ﬁrst semester of 2008 is the implementation challenge of the
strategy, which is progressing slower than anticipated. This problem is attributed to the capacity
limitation in key government institutions and various line ministries and departments. This
facility is a direct response with the requisite ﬂexibilities to enhance the impact of European
Commission support throughout the project cycle. The facility provides the means to ensure
that all requirements can be rapidly addressed to bring everything together towards the
successful implementation of EU support by these key Government of Malawi institutions and
otherstakeholders.

The Joint-Midterm Review of the 10th European Development Fund Country Strategy Paper
acknowledges the role of the Technical Cooperation Facility in European Development Fund
(EDP) programming in Malawi as vital and notes that the absorption capacity of the facility by
the Government of Malawi has been high with current levels of over 80% of the allocated funds
already contracted under Technical Assistance, Conferences, and Trainings. A first Programme
Estimate was endorsed by the Delegation to facilitate the ﬁnancing of trainings and conferences
aimed at building capacity and promoting dialogue in the spirit embodied in the ACP—EU
Partnership Agreement.

A number of proposed improvements suggested in the evaluation of Technical Cooperation
FauTtty phase I are taken into consideration in this project. Firstly, the management of
Technical Cooperation Facility phase III will be conducted by the National Authorising Ofﬁcer
and key Government stakeholders in closer collaboration with the EU Delegation. An enhanced
integrated monitoring system has been designed for use by the National Authorising Ofﬁcer;
and this will foster regular monitoring and ensure enhanced implementation of programmes and
projects in order to effectively contribute to achieving the goals of the National Indicative
Programme. In addition, and following recommendations of the ﬁnal evaluation of Technical
Cooperation Facility 1, efforts will continue to be made to sensitise Government stakeholders
ontlre uses and accessibility of the Facility.

As the project will beneﬁt the preparation and implementation of EU funded programmes,
projects and other initiatives, complementarities with other EU interventions are built in the
design. However, worth mentioning is the project's complementarity with the ongoing Capacity
Development for the National Authorising Officer—Support Unit in the Ministry of Finance
(budget EUR 7 000 000; 10th EDF), which has the main objective of reducing poverty and
raising economic growth in Malawi through the strengthened involvement of its Government in
the identiﬁcation and implementation of EU ﬁnanced programmes within focal and non focal
seemrs. While the National Authorising Ofﬁcer-Support Unit Capacity Development Project
establishes Government as the key interlocutor and administrator of EU funded projects in
Malawi, in line with the provisions of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the Technical
Cooperation Facility phase III will make available the resources to ﬁll in the capacity gaps that
exist during programme design, formulation, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and

audits. Furthermore, the project will look to foster EU—Malawi dialogue across other spheres of
development which include culture, trade, and the environment.

1.4 Donor coordination

The Department of Aid and Debt in the Ministry of Finance is responsible for donor
coordination, and is supported in this task by the National Authorising Ofﬁcer-Support Unit, as
far as the EU is concerned. Cooperation and coordination among development partners has
improved signiﬁcantly in recent years in line with the principles of the Paris Declaration.
Moreover, the Government of Malawi undertakes a Joint Annual Review with development
partners on Aid Effectiveness, which is also receiving support from the EDF via the Technical
Cooperation Facility. Other speciﬁc joint reviews are carried out, too, as demonstrated by the
development of the Development Assistance Strategy (DAS). In addition, some of the resources
under this action will be used by the National Authorising Ofﬁcer-Support Unit and
Government of Malawi in general in playing a coordinating role in the joint analysis of
Malawi's governance commitments (including conducting sector reviews), which are and will
remain to be of strategic importance in the implementation of European Development Fund
(EDF) funded programmes.

2. DESCRIPTION

2.1. Objectives

In line with Government of Malawi’s overarching strategy, Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS) , the overall objective of the project is to reduce poverty.

The speciﬁc objectives of the project are:

- Successful implementation of the Government of Malawi development strategy through
the support of sound development programmes ﬁnanced from European Development
Fund (EDF) funds and other EU ﬁtnded initiatives in Malawi including joint actions
with other donors.

- The fostering of a more coherent and informed approach to development and trade
issues.

2.2. Expected results
The expected results arising from the action are the following:

Result 1- Capacity of stakeholders enhanced. The design of the project will ensure that the
capacity of all key stakeholders and beneﬁciaries of European Development Fund
(EDF) funded programmes will be enhanced in line with the EDF Project Cycle. EDF
programming and management procedures in many cases present a serious challenge
of understanding on the part of the key beneficiaries; consequently Technical
Cooperation Facility (TCF) phase III will be used to build their capacities by making
available technical assistance; and trainings support for projects and programmes.

Result 2- Identiﬁcation, Design, Formulation, and Implementation, audits and evaluations of
EU funded projects, and programmes improved. Technical Cooperation Facility III
will make a positive contribution to the identiﬁcation, design, formulation,
implementation, audits and evaluations of EU funded projects, programmes, and
initiatives whenever they cannot be ﬁnanced out of the project itself or where it is
convenient or efﬁcient to combine a number of these actions or related intervention.
Through the National Authorising Ofﬁcer-Support Unit training and support will be
provided to line ministries and other stakeholders within project preparation and

 

implementation governed by EDF procedures. As and when requested, expertise will
be made available to assist in the identiﬁcation, design, formulation; monitoring,
evaluation, audits and other tasks of EU funded projects. Through these actions it is
expected that there will be a signiﬁcant improvement in the identiﬁcation, design,
formulation, implementation, monitoring, audits and evaluations of EDF funded
projects and programmes.

Result 3- Dialogue and Partnership between E U—Government of Malawi ofﬁcials enhanced.
By supporting the participation of Government of Malawi ofﬁcials and Non State
Actors in international meetings or seminars on development or trade themes, the
project will strengthen the dialogue and spirit of partnership that exists between EU
and Government of Malawi ofﬁcials at both the national and Africa-Caribbean-Paciﬁc
(ACP) wide levels. Dialogue and partnership are key cornerstones of the ACP-EU
Partnership Agreement and any action to promote these pillars goes a long way to
contributing to achievement of the objectives set in the ACP-EU Partnership
Agreement. As such, support towards Government of Malawi ofﬁcials and non-state
actors to participate in various international fora where EU-ACP cooperation is being
discussed or where international development, ﬁnance, and trade issues are being
deliberated contributes to fostering the objectives enshrined in the ACP—EU
Partnership Agreement.

Result 4— Awareness and owners/zip of E U EDF funded programmes and projects enhanced.
Through supporting workshops and conferences for Government of Malawi ofﬁcials
and/or non-state actors on topics related either to the European Development Fund or
other EU administrative and ﬁnancial procedures or the priorities of the ACP-EU
Partnership Agreement (poverty eradication, political dialogue and reinforced
participation, development cooperation, good governance, fair trade, etc.) awareness
and ownership of EU European Development Fund and other EU activities will be
enhanced. This includes supporting Government of Malawi host such
meetings/conferenoes/workshops and/or supporting them to attend such meetings
hosted by other governments or international organisations.

2.3. Activities and implementation timetable

Each of the above results will be the direct product of a speciﬁc area of activity. The four
results have been linked to three main activity areas to be implemented under the Technical
Cooperation Facility 111 Project. A detailed indicative implementation timetable has been
attached for reference as Attachment 1.

1. TAF — Technical Assistance Facility: this is a facility for the engagement of short- to
medium-term consultants to assist in the main stages of the project cycle to ensure the
effective identiﬁcation, design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and audits of the
National Indicative Programme and other EU programmes in favour of the country’s
development strategy, in keeping with the objectives of the ACP-EU Partnership
Agreement. This will include activities aimed at developing sector approaches when and
where required, as well as assistance to be provided for evaluation and audit of
project/programmes as necessary. Consultants will be engaged to assist with speciﬁc tasks
related to project identiﬁcation, preparation, design, implementation; as well as assistance
with tender procedures; and with evaluation and monitoring or audit where this has not
been sufﬁciently provided for in the project itself, or the project has already been closed.
The use of framework contractors and/or other service contractors will be made in the
various ﬁelds of EU—Malawi cooperation requiring such expertise, the procurement of
these services will be sub—delegated to the National Authorising Ofﬁcer through a

programme estimate as an when applicable. The budget for this component will be
EUR 3 400 000.

2. TSPP — Training Support for Projects & Programmes: this will ﬁnance various actions
such as seminars or awareness-raising activities prior to or during the formulation and
implementation of a project or programme in accordance with European Development
Fund and EU General Budget procedures. In combination with the Technical Assistance
Facility (TAF), this component will include activities aimed at supporting the
development of sector approaches when and where required. This will be implemented
through programme estimates and service contracts and the budget for this component

will be EUR 400 000.

3. CS — Conferences and Seminars: this includes: (a) more general short-term workshops,
and conferences for Government of Malawi ofﬁcials and/or non-state actors on topics
related either to the European Development Fund or sector reviews or other EU
administrative and ﬁnancial procedures or the priorities of the ACP-EU Partnership
Agreement (poverty eradication, political dialogue and reinforced participation,
development cooperation, good governance, fair trade, etc.), and (b) participation by
Government of Malawi ofﬁcials or non-state actors in international meetings or seminars
on development or trade themes; which may be organised by bodies or organisations other
than the European Union (for example United Nations, African Union, and regional
organisations of Southern and Eastern Africa); and (C) logistical support for identiﬁed
international events held in Malawi under Government of Malawi auspices. This will be
implemented through programme estimates and the budget for this component will be
EUR 500 000.

Commitment of resources available under the National Indicative Programme allocation will be
the min veriﬁable indicator for the project. This will involve the successful identiﬁcation,
formulation, implementation, evaluation and audit of actions under theProgramme. Evaluation
reports of participants on training activities attended, records of attendance at seminars and
conferences.
