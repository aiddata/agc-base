THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI

Title : Institutional Development Across the Agri-Food Sector (IDAF)
Accounting N°: 9 ACP MAI 019
Identiﬁcation 5P: MAJ/002/04

 

 

1. SUMMARY

Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world with over half of the ll million
population living in poverty. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing
subsistence livelihoods and employment for 85% oftlic population living in rural areas, on
an average annual household income of less than €l00. The agri-food sector contributes
approximately one third of GDP and accounts for 90% of national export earnings.

Economic growth is acknowledged as being essential for social development and poverty
reduction nationally. The development of the agri-food sector has the potential to reduce
poverty through improved production, agro-processing and marketing of produce for b0th
export and domestic markets. Such development however, will challenge the traditional
dependency on maize as the staple food crop and tobacco as the major export earner. The
agri-food sector will need to diversify into other enterprises through the development of
policies, strategies and institutional capacities, in order to realise its potential to access new
markets for crops such as spices, macadamia and legumes.

Weak institutional implementation capabilities in the public and non-public sectors,
combined with poor role clariﬁcation and minimal involvement of stakeholders, as partners
in setting development priorities, are recognised as major causes of the failure over the past
decade to record any signiﬁcant progress in the development of the sector.

A major thrust of the Institutional Development across the Agri-Food Sector (IDAF)

programme, wwwns, hydraulics,
responsibilities an reatrons rps, Wm
institutional capabilities in focal ministries and partnerslngs for sector-wide services
rovtsron. The programme, which extends over three years. with a total budget of

67970000 proposes the following six result areas:

1.! Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation & Food Security (MoAIFS) functions, mandate and
organizational structuret'systems are revised and renewed in the context of the transition to
decentralized diSIrict agricultural services provision and increased accountability to
stakeholders.

1.2 MoAIFS capacities are strengthened in the areas of: policy formulation. strategic
planning. monitoring and evaluation and support to the decentralization process,

1.3 District agricultural services, particularly extension services are reSponsive to the
demands of various categories of farmers and well coordinated in planning, management
and provision

L4 Farmer organizations. cooperatives and associations are ' and d v ed to
optimize production systems, market orientation and access to markets.

1.5 institutions and support systems to promote agri-food trade and realize access to export
markets are developed and Wmhips between the
public and private sectors.

1.6 Systems, facilities and competent personnel are in place to ensure international
standards, quality assurance and market accreditation for agri-food exports.

 

 

2. INTERVENTION

2.1 Objectives

The overall objective of the programme is to achieve sustainable improvement in the
livelihoods of the rural poor in line with the national strategic priorities as set out in the
MPRSP. NIP and ongoing policy development for the Malawi agri~food sector.

2.2 Purpose

The purpose of the programme is to support and facilitate an enabling institutional
environment for development and growth across the agri~food value chain, through the
development of institutional capabilities of public and non-public actors, within a coherent
conceptual framework.

2.3 Expected results and main activities

Result 1. MoAIFS functions, mandate and organisational structure/systems are
revised and renewed in the context of the transition to decentralised district
agricultural services provision and increased accountability to stakeholders. Core
functions analysis will take place across all MoAIFS departments. following which the
programme will facilitate services systems renewal and institutional reorganization.
Transitional steering teams will be set up to take a lead in change management.
Management, staff and stakeholders will be orientated on PRSP, CFA and PSIP.
Legislature will be reviewed in line with the new mandate of MoAlFS. The programme
will support the development of a stakeholder advisory panel at national level.

Result 2. MoAIFS capacities are strengthened in policy formulation, strategic
planning, proﬁsion of production services and support to decentralisation. Existing
capacities in public and non-public sectors will be studied. The roles, responsibilities and
relationships of management and operational staff will be reviewed in line with the CFA,
The capacities of MoAll-‘S will be strengthened through a staff training and development
programme to better respond to new 3Rs. Competencies in project planning, project cycle
management, proposal writing, multi-disciplinary policy formulation, farmer organization
development and participatory extension methods will be developed. A strategy for
supporting district services will be formulated. A ministry-wide programme and services
committee will be established to coordinate activities across the ministry's departments.
Systems for performance management, ﬁnancial management, administration and AMIS
will be put in place. Stakeholder—led strategies for agricultural innovation and research will
be developed. Strategic plans will be developed at sector, ministry and departmental levels.

Rem]! 3. District agricultural services are responsive to the demands of various
categories of farmers and are well coordinated In planning. management and
proﬁsion. A district agricultural policy. planning and development programme will be
formulated. DADOs, N005, DPDs. non-public sector and farmer groups will undergo
training to enable them to adapt to renewal of services systems. District planning and
implementation capabilities for agricultural development and service
coordination’pmvision will be enhanced. Needs of various categories of clients at national,
regional and sub-district’area levels will be identiﬁed to appropriately respond to demand
for services. Agricultural inforrnation'resource centres will be established to enable farmers
to make informed choices and decisions in commodity production, value-adding and
marketing. Studies on funding and financing of services will be can'icd out in line with the
new agricultural extension policy launched by MoAlFS.

\

 

 

Result 4. Farmer organisations. cooperatives and associations are supported and
developed to optimise production systems, market orientation and access to markets.
The programme “ill compile inventories and proﬁles of farmer organizations and related
groups who will be supported through FOD training programmes. Capacxties to support
FOD will be enhanced through training of public and private sector extension service
providers. Linkages between F05 and agribusiness. processing and marketing will be
established. Research on funding and ﬁnancing of agricultural enterprises through PCs will
be carried out.

Result 5. Institutions and support systems to promote agri-food trade and access to
export markets are developed and strengthened through commercial partnerships
between the public and private sectors. A national strategic plan for food exports will be
deveIOped and capacities, 3R5 and organizational structures of MoT&PSD, MEPC/ MIPA
will be reviewed in the context of the future development of the agri-food sector.
Appropriate production and processing technologies and systems (including marketing
mechanisms) for various commodities in the agri-food industry will be assessed and
promoted. Producer liaison groups will be formed and national food exporters associations
still be strengthened as advocacy groups for the industry to facilitate linkages between
stakeholders. An agribusiness and food industry management and enterprise development
programme will be designed and implemented which will enhance knowledge and

capabilities in international agri-trade and disseminate agri-food market information along
the value chain.

Result 6. Systems, facilities and competent personnel are in place to international
standards, quality assurance and market accreditation for ngri~food exports. A
feasibility study on national needs for quality assurance including strategic requirements
for the development of the agri-food Sub-sector will be conducted. Existing capabilities,
systems and facilities in the food industry will be assessed in line with national needs.
Capacities and capabilities of industry and agencies in quality assurance will be enhanced

through training. The programme will support the setting up of quality assurance
ncm'orksv’associations.

2.3 indicators

The pattem of growth and development in the agri-food sector, particularly after
implementation of the major reform and capacity building efforts during the ﬁrst two to
three years. will be the most signiﬁcant indicators of the economic and ﬁnancial
sustainability of the programme. Benchmarking of institutional capacities at the outset of
the programme will be essential in order to evaluate progress and conduct public good and
cosv’bcncﬁt analyses at various stages during its implementation. The programme
assessments of institutional performance (in public and non-public sectors) in support of
national strategies and targets for the sector will be important indicators of how enabling
the Overall effort has been in moving from the current weak sectoral capabilities, towards
more stronger competencies and objecrively recognised improvements in services to clients
and stakeholders.

The formulation of a new mandate and organogram for MoAIFS. combined with an active
performance management system and the contents of impact evaluation reports and

strategic plans. will all indicate degrees of change. Specific process indicators are shown in
Annex 1.

 

 

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

3.1 Physical and non physical means

The programme has to provide high quality leadership, facilitation and implementation
know-how and demonstrable public sector commitment to the coordination. management
and ﬁnancial administration of all programme aspects, sub-projects and activities.

The programme will place strong emphasis on competency development among
counterparts in partner institutions so as to build strong local capabilities at all levels — as a
deliberate and preferred approach to substituting external expertise continually for
unavailable or underdeveloped partner capabilities. Two Long-term Technical Assistants,
provided through the programme, will need proven proﬁciencies in designing, guiding and
facilitating institutional transformation processes. They will be actively engaged in
catalyzing and supporting institutional change management -— not merely advocating or
prescribing change agendas.

Two long-term Senior Advisers. at national level, will be provided for the three—year period
of the programme; one in Agricultural Institutional Development and Services Systems,
principally for the change and reorganization process in MoAlFS and the second in
Agribusiness and Food Export Market Development, principally for the development of
enhanced capability in MOT&PSD and the private sector. Other professionals will also be
contracted as short-term AdvisorsfFacilitators in areas such as District Decentralization of
Services, FOD. Ago—Enterprise Development, PEAS, M&E and Impact Assessment. Short—
term experts in a range of specialisms will support speciﬁc assignments/activities. All ToRs
for assignments and inputs will place primary focus on the enhancement of local
competence through mentoring and coaching of counterparts to improve performance at
inditidual. team’peer and wider institutional levels. The roaramme will have a six-month
Orientation and Preparation Phase to raise atvarenm,
modalities, expected contributions and beneﬁts for actors across the agri-food sector.

.i

 

3.2 Organisational and Implementation procedures

The overall responsibility for the implementation of the programme lies with the National
Authorising Ofﬁcer (NAO)

In accordance with Article 35(1) of Annex IV of the Cotonou Agreement the NAG will
delegate to the MoAIFS his powers of implementation. The detailed modalities of this
delegation, including the exact level of powers, authorised thresholds for public
procurement and grants delegated by the NAG to the Imprcst Administrator (IA) anchor the
Accounting Ofﬁcer (A0), will be defined in the overall work plan and the annual work
plans’cost estimates in respect of the 9m EDF regulations.

A Programme Coordination Unit (PCU) will be established under the authority of the
MoAIFS. Programme-estimates for operations will be conducted under direct labor. The
preparation, management and implementation of the programme-estimates must comply
with rules set out in the Practical guide to management of direct-labour operations and
programme-estimates ﬁnanced by the EDF.

Two long-term TA Senior Advisers will be provided for the three-year period of the
programme: one in Agricultural Institutional Development and Services Systems,
principally for the change and reorganisation process in MoAIFS and the second in

er s» “Woman-m

 

 

 

Agribusiness and Food Export Market Development, principally for the development of
enhanced capability in .\ioT&PSD, MEPC and the private sector. Recruitment of the TAs
will follow the international restricted tender procedure, a derogation to authorise the use of
the suspension clause for tendering is granted.

MoAlFS will commit professional staff to facilitate core aspects of the programme such as
district decentralisation of services, FOD, agri-enterprise development, PEAS, M&E and
impact assessment. Short-term experts in a range of specialists will support speciﬁc
activities. All ToRs for assignments and inputs will place primary focus on the
enhancement of local competencies through mentoring and coaching of counterparts in
order to improve performance at individual, team and wider institutional levels.

Programme oversight will take place at two levels:

At the policy level, the MoAlFS Director of Planning will chair a Programme Steering
Committee (PSC) that will include a counterpart from the MoT&PSD, a representative of
the National Authorising Officer, a representative of the MoEP&D, the lDAF Programme
Coordinator, the two long term Technical Assistants and a representative of the EC
Delegation in Malawi with observer status. The PSC will provide a vital backstopping
function for programme management which will include: uidance on ‘ ‘
approval of programme estimates and ensunW
gogramme is in line with work plan and cost estimates.

At programme implementation level, a Programme Co—ordinator (PC), will in turn chair a
Technical Co-ordination Group (T CG) whose composition will include the two TAS,
programme counterparts/subject matter specialists and representatives of a stakeholder
panel'. Reporting to the PSC through the PC, the TCG will meet monthly to ensure the
smooth functioning of programme technical and implementation aspects. All specialists
will report to the PC who will, in his capacity as leader of the implementing team, in turn
report to the MoAIFS Director of Planning on day-to-day programme implementation
issues.

All call fore tenders and contracts will be conducted in accordance with 99‘ EDF rules an
procedures.

 

3.3 Appropriate technology

IDAF is a people-centred programme, aimed at facilitating change. In this respect the
programme does no ‘ h olo ical as ts but rather seeks to employ the
appropriate ‘soﬁware‘ of development practise to the challenges of transformation.
Through the development of management, specialist and field-level competencies in PEAS,
facilitation of rural community development in all districts will be more appropriate to the
resource endowments and needs of the majority of smallholder farmers, than under the
existing transfer-of-technology paradigm. The refocusing and reorganisation of agricultural
services provision at national and district levels will engage with the new demand issues
arising in terms of the different categories and needs of farmers, especially the rural poor.

3.4 Timetables, cost and financing plan

The programme is designed for implementation over a three-year period. There will be a
six month Orientation Phase (during the ﬁrst half of year one) to sensitise all actors across
the sector to the aims. modalities and expected contributions from key implementing
partners; this phase will start with the recruitment of the national programme coordinator
and the two senior advisers/facilitators.

3.3. Special conditions and accompanying measures to be taken by the government

The Government of Malawi will have to meet the following conditions prior and during

implementation of the programme:

0 GoM‘s National Poverty Reduction Strategy is implemented according to schedule.

0 60M in coordination with other projects and programmes identiﬁes common clear
guidelines to avoid duplication of activities.

7- o The MoAIl-‘S to determine and maintain a long-term strategy on agricultural

development.

d. MONITORING, EVALUATION, AUDIT

4.1 rilouimring and Evaluation

The programme will set up and maintain internal component tracking procedures, using the
indicators developed for each key result area. to provide management with quarterly
monitoring information through which it can assess levels of institutional development,
performance and change. The PC C will assess reports and present them with comments to
the NAG An internal programme-wide monitoring exercise based on peer review will be
conducted each year and ﬁndings shared with stakeholders.

4.2 Reviews and audits

An external impact assessment and evaluation review of the programme will be conducted,
on behalf of the EU, towards the end of the third year. Outcomes of the third year review
will inform EU and other donors on the viability of pursuing a further three-year
programme. Lessons learnt in the ﬁrst three years will inform any adjustments.

In any event, when total expenditure incurred by the direct-labour component of
programme-estimates is € 200,000 or more the expenditure has to be ﬁnancially audited
before submission of the closure report.

Audits must be carried out by approved auditors who are members of an internationally
recognised auditing certiﬁcation association. Their job is to verify the programme‘s
accounts and certify that the expenditure by the direct-labour component of the
programme-estimates was committed, validated and paid in accordance with the
programme of measures, the budget estimated and the technical and administrative
implementing arrangements for the corresponding programme-estimates, the procedures for
awarding EDP contracts and grants. the rules of the practical guide to management of
direct-labour operations and programme-estimates ﬁnanced by the EDF and generally
accepted accountancy principles. Audits may also be conducted on the systems and
procedures introduced, where necessary.

An Audit provision is foreseen in the budget of this Financing Agreement. According to
Article 23 of the Financial Regulation, the Chief Authorising Ofﬁcer can use this provision
to organize an independent audit.

Audit and evaluation contracts and framework contracts are always concluded by the
Commission acting for and on behalf of the ACP State concerned

An independent auditor selected by the NAG shall undertake external audits on an annual
and end of project basis.

ANNEX A. RISKS AND ASSUMPTIONS

it is acknowledged that the macroeconomic environment remains generally non-conducive. to
growth and therefore investment in the economy. For a viable, export-oriented agri-food
sector to develop and ﬂourish, the COM must address negative fiscal policy and budget
management issues. The new, post-election (May 2004) Cabinet appears to be heading in the
right directiOn.

A pro-condition attached to the programme is an agreement on the level of MoAIF S (00M)
commitment to the processes of change described within it. To date, verbal agreement has
been reached that the MoAlFS will take a leading and active role in co-coordinating the
IDAF programme with other ministries and stakeholders. whilst ensuring implementation of
activities throughout its own divisions and service departments. It will be important that
MoAlFS engage purposefully with the initiatives for reorganization and renewal across the
ministry, including the early completion of the core functions analysis exercise in the context
of the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP). There will also be a crucial need for a
smooth and efﬁcient flow of programme funds from the ministry to other implementing
partners in the public and private sectors.

A positive indicator of MoAlFS‘ commitment to IDAF will be its continued support to the
decentralimtion of agricultural services to the districts. The Planning, Human Resource and
Finance divisions of MoAIFS will be expected to work harmoniously with other departments
to improve information systems, ﬁnancial management capacities and performance
management systems across the ministry, It is assumed that the MoAlFS and donors will
respond favourably to lessons learned.

It is also assumed that the nonpublic sector will, with greater involvement and input as key
stakeholders to sectoral decision-making, contribute more actively to development
partnerships and programmes with public sector ministries, NGOs and Farmer Organizations.

ANNEX B. FACTORS ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY

3.1. Ownership by beneficiaries:

The emphasis on process facilitation and organisation development (OD). in catalysing
transformational change among and within institutional partners across the sector, will lay an
enduring basis for Ownership. Competency development among partners will be
comprehensively provided for as the fulcrum for wider institutional capacity development in
activities under all result areas. In terms of sustainable institutional development, this has
major implications for the calibre and quality of long-term advisors’facilitators selected and
supported by donors as they will need proven proﬁciencics in designing, guiding and
facilitating institutional transformation processes and capacities at strategic and system-'wide
levels to develop local organisational capacities.

IDAFr DTA -A:\"z\’EX;I & B

 

 

8.2. Cross-sectoral sustainability:

As an integrated sector-wide initiative focusing on institutional competency development. the
programme will provide conceptual coherence for sector development. The involvement of
stakeholders at district and national levels will help to assure relevance and sustainability in
both the development of institutional capacities in the public and non-public sectors and the
prevision of services to clients. Renewed and capacitatcd institutions across the sector will be
enabled to better address their policy and programme obligations related to staff welfare,
social and gender equity. natural resource conservation and environmental protection.
Participatory extension approaches (PEAS) recognise and engage with the need for
emancipation of rural women ~ an often-marginalized group — in problem solving and
decision-making to assure food security at household levels.

3.3. National policy measures:

There is no comprehensive. coherent sector policy. nor is there a broad framework for the
development of the sector. While there are some national and departmental policy documents
available in the MoAIFS, they are largely reference narratives with minimal guidance on
implementation. The Malawi Agricultural Sector investment Programme (MASIP) has been
in existence since 1995 under the auspices of the MiniStry. Initially supported by DANIDA
and latterly by DFID, MASIP has no substantial accomplishments to date and maintains only
limited substantive interaction with non-govemmental and private sector stakeholders.

The effective implementation of the MPRSP, as the most signiﬁcant existing national
measure, is important for this programme as it aims to develop a viable institutional basis for
economic growth across the sector. The planned Public Sector Reform Programme (PSRP)
will also be crucial to the success of the agendas of reform and renewal for implementation
by public sector partners. The policy response and engagement of GoM with the issues
highlighted for action in .4 Growth Strategy for Malawi (NAG, 2003) will also be of crucial
importance in fostering a more conducive macroeconomic envimnment.

3.4. Institutional and management capacity:

The programme focuses on the strengthening and development of institutional capacities
across the sector at national and district levels. At national level, the policy formulation
capacities of partner ministries will be strengthened and they will be facilitated and supported
to reorganise and renew their mandates and structures in order to better support important
national processes such as decentralisation of resources and decision-making to districts for
improved relevance and accountability in services provision for rural communities. There is a
wide range of comprehensive and speciﬁcally focused activities to build institutional
capacities under the result areas of the programme.

3.5. Complementarity and sectoral coordination between donors:

Aid co-ordination has been established with regards to both political dialogue with 00M and

progress in selected areas. These measures include:

0 Common Approach to Budgetary Support (CABS) with DiiD. European Commission and
Swedish SIDA
Aid Coordination Group with regular meetings. chaired by donors on a rotation basis.

0 National Action Group (NAG) which pI'OVldCS a tripartite forum of discussion between
Government of Malawi, the private sector and the donor community.

0 Sector Wide Approach in the Health Sector, involving most donors.

Various sector Donor Groups which meet on a regular basis, c.g. Group on Finance and

Economic Management, Donor Group on Private Sector (DFlD Chair), Donor group on

IDAF- DTA - ANNEXA & B

 

, 4)"

Good Governance. Group on Impr0vcd Public Service Delivery, Agriculture and Food
e ecurity Group.

8.6. Economic and ﬁnancial sustainability:

Capable and high-perfonning institutions are the sine qua non for economic and social
develOpment achieved through export—led gromh in developed and developing countries.
Evidence from a recent study conducted across a wide range of countries on the relative
importance of policies, institutions and geography in development highlights the primacy of
institutions as the crucial factor in achieving higher economic and social performance in
national development. (Roots of Development: What Matters Most for Development o
Geography, Institutions or Policy? Economist, October 5, 2002. UK).

The successful conclusion of the IDAF programme will create a functional environment that
will encourage other donors to engage with MoAlFS and further promote private sector
involvement and investment through partnerships aeross the Agri-food sector. In this respect
it acts as a lever to increase global funding which impacts positively on the livelihoods of
some of the most vulnerable groups in Malawi.
