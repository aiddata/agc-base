3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

3.1 Background and Contextual Analysis

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme (MLBP) commenced in January 2006 and reflects a long—term
commitment to sustainable rural livelihoods development in Malawi. It is influenced by past experiences
and ongoing work of three Malawian member based organisations, namely Farmers Union of Malawi
(FUM), National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi (NASFAM) and Malawi Union of Savings and
Credit Co—operatives (MUSCCO), as well as those from Sweden; Swedish Co—operative Centre (SCC) and
Vi—Agro forestry.

The first financial period ended in December 2008. The present document is prepared to guide the
second financial 5 years period from 2009 to 2013. The current plan is still based on the guidelines and
general orientations of the original Programme Document. However, this document is strongly
influenced by the experiences and lessons from the first period as well as to the current socioeconomic
reality and new trends in international development. It also takes in consideration recommendations
from the Review Study carried out in February 2007, The Assessment (Climate Change) carried out in
Nov—December 2007, The Lesson Learnt Study — June 2008, The Consortium Strategic Planning
documentation from April 2008, the most recent Evaluation report of Dec 2008 as well as several studies
undertaken during the first period. The MLBP will continue co—operating with other projects and
programmes related to agriculture and rural development as well as consulting representatives from the
village, sub—district and district levels to make sure that the activities are in line with the ongoing
decentralised development—oriented activities.

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme is addressing the challenges and needs articulated by the village and
district level representatives. It is also fully in line with Malawi’s current national development plans and
priorities (see below). Specific alignment has been made with one of the three pillars of the Agricultural
Development Programme (ADP) known as agribusiness and marketing development which reflects the
MLBP’s strategic objective. Together with National Adaptation Plan of Action, The two initiatives will be
looked into in the context of decentralisation. Furthermore, the programme is coherent with Norway’s
development co—operation policy and country specific priorities for the agriculture sector.

3.2 Problem Analysis and Justification for Continuation of MLBP

Malawi’s economy on the other hand is mostly dependent on agriculture. Agriculture contributes about
40 percent of GDP and more than 90 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings as well as
employing about 90 percent of the population. The smallholder subsector is the major contributor to
food production in the country. Over 85 percent of the food consumed in Malawi is produced by
smallholder farmers.

There are however, a number of challenges that the agricultural sector is facing in Malawi. Malawi’s
agricultural production is characterised by very low productivity due to a number of problems. Most of
the agricultural land in Malawi is cultivated by smallholder subsistence farmers who cultivate on very
small landholding sizes. On average, the households cultivate 1.2 hectares of land. The per capita
landholding size for the rural poor households is 0.23 hectares. It is therefore, very hard for these poor
households to produce adequately enough to satisfy both their food and cash needs. Coupled to this is
the fact that cost of inputs is very high and most of the poor households are not able to access them.

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

Malawi’s agriculture is also suffering from frequent shocks resulting from climate change. Problems
associated with climate change are resulting in frequent droughts and floods which negatively affect the
smallholder farming communities. In addition to these challenges is the problem of inadequacy of
services such as extension, marketing and credit facilities. The past two decades have been
characterised by dwindling quality of government extension services due to several factors. The
extension services are suffering from shortage of staff due to staff attrition for various reasons such as
going for greener pastures in NGOs and the private sector, deaths especially resulting from HIV and AIDS
related illnesses, normal retirements among many others. In response to these and many other
challenges, the Government of Malawi has put in place a policy framework to guide stakeholders such as
MLBP in the implementation of various development strategies.

While remarkable positive changes in rural livelihoods of the people of Salima and Mangochi that have
been involved in MLBP activities within the past three years (MLBP 2008), the core problems that were
identified in the Programme Document (MLBP 2005) of limited productive capacity of farmers as well as
limited organizational capacity of farmers and fisher folk continue to push the majority of them below
the poverty line. In addition, the fight against poverty is undermined by the adverse effects of global
warming and climate change.

The final evaluation of MLBP that was conducted between 13 October and 20 November 2008 by Bunda
College and UMB indicated that overall, the MLBP programme made significant progress on consortium
governance and partnership and also made overwhelming successes on issues of gender, rights, and
inequalities in terms of economic and social empowerment of women through adult literacy
programme, study circles and group savings and loan (GSL) programme. In addition, MLBP made a
remarkable impact on policy change on crucial issues of Input (Fertilizer) Subsidy Programme, and
government directive on the ban of sale of maize that characterized the year 2008. Despite these
performance indicators, the team noted, however, that the major challenge remains on how MLBP can
scale up the various activities so that farmers make a "quantum leap” from poverty and that the
activities are at the scale where each of the partner organizations are able to play their roles in line with
their respective strategic plans.

From the evaluation therefore, the phase that just ended could be considered as a pilot phase meant to
put down governance and management structures for effective implementation of some agricultural and
non—farm technologies for business investments. Such investments take more than 3—5 years to bear
fruits. All the technologies that were introduced by the MLBP including oil extraction, fruit and vegetable
drying, brick making, bee keeping and cash cropping are activities that need to be scaled up as the time
during the pilot phase was not sufficient for impact to be felt. Furthermore, most of these interventions
have been introduced at group level. For the individual members of these groups to start appreciating
the impact of these interventions, there is need to make sizeable amounts of incomes to share amongst
themselves, which may take much longer time than 3—5 years. Hence there is a need to extend the
programme for another 5 years in order to achieve this.

In the new period, a broader and more pragmatic approach will be adopted which will entail up scaling
and out scaling, working with progressive farmers/groups, more collaboration with like minded
organizations and more field presence by the local consortium partners, among others . Apart from
scaling up in terms of size, the programme needs to be scaled up in space. The next phase will allow for
this to happen. In addition, most of the income generating interventions can not succeed unless
associated with the required marketing skills which include ability to identify markets, advertising their
products, national and international hygienic (sanitary) production systems including ability to meet

Malawi Lake Basin Programme Document 2009-2013

 

appropriate legislation requirements like standards by the Malawi Bureau of Standards, packaging and
labelling etc. The groups need to be adequately trained and assisted in these skills. This could not
effectively be implemented to the full during the pilot phase due to the small scale of the investments
made. Again the second phase is critical in rolling out the marketing initiatives that were started during
the pilot phase.

Finally, it is planned that the new phase will be used to forge and strengthen the much needed linkages
and partnerships with other important programs such as TLC, University of Life Sciences, ARDEP, CARD
and Bunda College so that innovative approaches to dealing with critical issues of climate change are
implemented and farmers are adequately empowered to cope with such challenges

3.3 The Malawi Lake Basin Programme (MLBP): Operational
frame work 2009-2013

The next phase of Malawi Lake Basin Programme (MLBP) aims to continue building the productive
capacity of farmers as well as the organizational capacity of farmers, fishermen and their organization in
order to make a "quantum push” to the majority of farmers who are below the poverty line to levels
above the poverty. In addition, the fight against poverty is undermined by the adverse effects of global
warming and climate change which will seriously be mainstreamed in the programme.

From experience of the first three years of implementation of the MLBP, the consortium model will
continue to be unique for Malawi and will be used as the implementation strategy for the programme.

The overall development goal of the programme is:

"Improved livelihoods has alleviated and reduced poverty for the rural poor households in
Programme areas within the year 2013 as compared with baseline data..”

In order to achieve the goal, the following objectives of the programme are deﬁned as:

Strategic Objective

“Rural livelihoods have been improved by transforming subsistence and emergent smallholders in
agriculture and ﬁsheries into business oriented enterprises.”

Specific Objectives

1. Agricultural production, productivity and access to food has been increased through adaptation
to climate change.

2. Farmers income and asset accumulation have increased through innovations in farm or non—
farm activities.

3. Alternative livelihood options for income and employment generation have been up—scaled,
including sustainable financial services to support agriculture development in the targeted
areas.

4. Farmers’ voice, rights and ability to express themselves have been heard and accepted in policy
issues and matters concerning their lives.

5. Effective systems for the procurement of inputs and marketing of farmers’ produce are establish
and functioning satisfactorily.

10

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

6. Viable and sustainable financial services are established to support agriculture development in
the targeted areas.

7. Institutional capacity of Malawian consortium members has been strengthened to implement
the programme and strategic plans

The programme has several sub—programmes, objectives and outputs as follows:
3.3.1 Sub-programme 1: Organisation and business development

This sub programme has been renamed from the one in the pilot phase. This has been done to reflect
the focus of the programme into more business orientation while recognizing other cross cutting issues
such as democracy. This means that the programme will become more business oriented than in the
pilot phase. The sub programme objective has also been changed to reflect this focus. This component
involves organisational, business development and governance with a major focus on sound
organisational leadership and provision of efficient services to the members such as agricultural input,
produce marketing systems and rural financial services. In a more long—term perspective, empowering
and strengthening the policy influencing capacity of farmers and fishermen would also be a part of this
component. The programme will ensure that women’s rights, interests and participation are properly
integrated in policy and programmes.

The objective ofthis sub—programme is:

"Smallholder producers are enabled and organised to influence policies and transform their
economies into profitable and viable businesses”.

The following specific outputs will be expected under this sub—programme:

0 Target groups more involved in commercial production and/or other economic
enterprises.

0 Producer associations and cooperative societies in target areas Established

0 income, assets and services among target groups in general improved.

0 The presence of Democratic farmers’ organisations with representative structures at
national, district and local level Increased.

0 Member based farmers’ organisations more capacitated to analyse, develop and
influence agricultural and fishing policies.

0 Equitable access to opportunities, active participation, services and programme benefits
for men, women and youth promoted

0 HIV and AIDS infected target groups enabled to participate and share social and
economic welfare.

0 Farmers organised in Production Associations, Cooperatives and other Economic
Enterprises.

3.3.2 Sub programme 2: Agriculture, Fisheries & Adaptation to Climate
Change

Stemming from the first three years of the programme, the programme will address the problems on
declining productivity for agriculture as well as shortfalls and opportunities that adaptation to climate
change offers to small producers on their way from subsistence into business agriculture. The
programme will also address management and sustainable utilisation of the natural resource including
fisheries and forestry. Appropriate and sustainable production approaches will be promoted, scaled up,
and supported.

The objective of the sub programme is:

11

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

"Improved livelihoods and incomes of rural households achieved by adapting to climate
change in sustainable agriculture and fisheries based production.”

The following specific outputs are expected to be delivered under this sub—programme

o A diversified risk—coping and market oriented agricultural production established in
target areas

0 Alternative and diversified income and employment generating opportunities
introduced and promoted

0 Appropriate land husbandry and demand driven productivity enhancing technologies
developed, implemented and adopted

0 Appropriate water uses and water conservation technologies adapted, developed and
implemented

0 Production of agro forestry systems including fruits and multi—purpose tree species

promoted and taken up by the target groups

Farmers capacity to deal with uncertainty increased

Traditional local coping mechanisms to climate change improved

Awareness about climate change and adaptation raised

Increased tree cover and sustainable systems for producing and using fuel wood

developed and implemented

0 Capacity of Village Natural Resource Management Committees and Beach Village
Committees strengthened

0000

3.3.3 Sub-programme 3: Institutional Development

In contrast to pure budgetary support, this sub programme has been designed to create a business
enabling environment by influencing institutional changes to the benefit of smallholder producers. This
sub—programme will concentrate on the strengthening of the three national organisations addressing
selected issues of their strategic development plans in order to increase their operational as well as
lobby and advocacy capacity to generate institutional changes in the agriculture sector in term of
policies, norms, rules and governance. The success of the ADP, the effective implementation of NAPA
and the regional vision of the MLBP require strong farmers’ organisations ability to mobilise democratic
groups and represent, not only the national interest of their members but also be capable of influencing
regional policies.

The objective ofthis sub programme is

"To strengthen the capacity of Malawian Consortium members to generate institutional
changes for the improvement of the business environment and gain own competence in
business development for smallholders’ producers.”

The following outputs will be delivered under this sub programme:

1. Institutional framework to create conducive business environment for smallholders Improved.

Mobilisation of democratic organisations at grass roots level improved.

3. Ability of grass root organizations to lobby and influence policy as well as to fully participate in the
ADP process improved

4. Organizational competence of national consortium organizations to fulfil their roles in the MLBP
increased

5. Organizational competence of national consortium organizations increased.

6. Financial sustainability improved

1 GENERAL BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION

1.1 GENERAL BACKGROUND

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme commenced in January 2006 and reflects a long—term commitment to
sustainable rural livelihoods development in Malawi. It is influenced by past experiences and ongoing
work of three Malawian member based organisations, namely Farmers Union of Malawi (FUM), National
Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi (NASFAM) and Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Co—
operatives (MUSCCO), as well as those from Sweden; Swedish Co—operative Centre (SCC) and Vi—Agro
forestry.

The Consortium was established to pool resources and benefit from the various focus areas and
capacities of each individual organisation. It is the first time that three key apex organisations in Malawi
are teaming up in a formal alliance that is linked to a joint programme. The Consortium brings together
key and professional competencies in the areas of farmer organisational development and management,
market oriented agricultural production, business development, rural financial services and natural
resource management.

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme was prepared through an extensive participatory process that
encompassed a review of available literature, such as socio—economic profiles and district development
plans of Mangochi and Salima, national development policies and strategies, various relevant project
and programme reports focusing on lessons learnt. Furthermore, the process involved interviews with
various stakeholders, including the key three government departments of agriculture, fisheries and
forestry. Two district participatory planning seminars were also arranged, in which farmers, fishermen,
local extension workers, traditional leaders and other development organisations working in the
targeted districts were invited to participate. Since its inception, several other stakeholders meetings
have been held including workshops, planning meetings, information sessions, field days, open days,
sensitization events, etc.

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme is addressing the challenges and needs articulated by the village and
district level representatives. It is also fully in line with Malawi’s current national development plans and
priorities (see below). Furthermore, it is coherent with Norway’s development co—operation policy and
country specific priorities for the agriculture sector.

The first financial period ends in December 2008. The present document is prepared to guide the second
financial 5 years period from 2009 to 2013. The current plan is still based on the guidelines and general
orientations of the original Programme Document. However, this document is strongly influenced by the
experiences and lessons from the first period as well as the current socioeconomic reality and new
trends in international development. It also takes in consideration recommendations from the Review
Study carried out in February 2007, The Assessment (Climate Change) carried out in Nov—December
2007, The Lesson Learnt Study — June 2008, The Consortium Strategic Planning documentation from
April 2008 as well as several studies undertaken during the first period. The MLBP will continue co—
operating with other projects and programmes related to agriculture and rural development as well as
consulting representatives from the village, sub—district and district levels to make sure that the activities
are in line with the ongoing decentralised development—oriented activities.

returns to labour and capital need to be performed to guide decision such as the right level of
production to make economic sense. Most of these interventions have been introduced at group level.
For the individual members of these groups to start appreciating the impact of these interventions,
there is need to make sizeable amounts of incomes to share amongst themselves, which may take much
longer time than 3—5 years. Regarding poverty line computations, these are made on the basis of the
daily per capita basic needs. If the contributions of these interventions are to be appreciated among the
individual members of groups, there is need to demonstrate that the income coming from these
interventions is making impact with respect to that poverty line. Hence there is a need to extend the
programme for another 5 years in order to achieve this.

Most of the income generating interventions can not succeed unless associated with the required
marketing skills which include ability to identify markets, advertising their products, national and
international hygienic (sanitary) production systems including ability to meet appropriate legislation
requirements like standards by the Malawi Bureau of Standards, packaging and labelling etc. The groups
need to be adequately trained and assisted in these skills. Some of that expertise already exists among
consortium members while some of it might have to be sourced from elsewhere. This could not
effectively be implemented to the full during this pilot phase due to the small scale of the investments
made.

Finally, it is planned that the new phase will be used to forge and strengthen the much needed linkages
and partnerships with other important programs/institutions such as TLC, University of Life Sciences,
ARDEP, CARD and Bunda College so that innovative approaches to dealing with critical issues of climate
change are implemented and farmers are adequately empowered to cope with such challenges.

During the coming five years it is foreseen that the Malawi Lake Basin Programme will take a leading
role in the business development of the rural communities in Malawi. The composition and
competence of the consortium members provides all the needed pre—conditions to become a leader
in promoting organisations and business development among the rural population as well as an
important factor in bringing the civil society into the ADP process.

 

 

2 CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS
2.1 GENERAL

Poverty still remains a major characteristic for the large majority of the Malawian population. Despite
the fact that survey results show some progress from 1998 when the first Integrated Household Survey
(IHS1) was conducted to 2004/05 when the second Integrated Household Survey (IHS2) was conducted,
the proportion of people still living in poverty is still very high. According to |HS2 (2005) more than half
of the Malawian population (52 percent) still live below the poverty line. One fifth of the population (22
percent) live in extreme poverty, below the poverty line, the largest of these poor people are living in
rural areas especially in the Southern Region of the country. Urban areas have a much lower percentage
of the poor (25 percent).

Malawi’s economy on the other hand is mostly dependent on agriculture. Agriculture contributes about
40 percent of GDP and more than 90 percent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings as well as
employing about 90 percent of the population. The smallholder subsector is the major contributor to
food production in the country. Over 85 percent of the food consumed in Malawi is produced by
smallholder farmers.

There are however, a number of challenges that the agricultural sector is facing in Malawi. Malawi’s
agricultural production is characterised by very low productivity due to a number of problems. Most of
the agricultural land in Malawi is cultivated by smallholder subsistence farmers who cultivate on very
small landholding sizes. On average, the households cultivate 1.2 hectares of land. The per capita
landholding size for the rural poor households is 0.23 hectares. It is therefore, very hard for these poor
households to produce adequately enough to satisfy both their food and cash needs. Coupled to this is
the fact that cost of inputs is very high and most of the poor households are not able to access them.

Malawi’s agriculture is also suffering from frequent shocks resulting from climate change. Problems
associated with climate change are resulting in frequent droughts and floods which negatively affect the
smallholder farming communities. In addition to these challenges is the problem of inadequacy of
services such as extension, marketing and credit facilities. The past two decades have been
characterised by dwindling quality of government extension services due to several factors. The
extension services are suffering from shortage of staff due to staff attrition for various reasons such as
going for greener pastures in NGOs and the private sector, deaths especially resulting from HIV and AIDS
related illnesses, normal retirements among many others.

Apart from ADMARC which only buys specified agricultural products, smallholder farmers have to sell
their produce on the local market which is much unorganised. Farmers cannot determine the prices for
their produce neither are they able to forecast such prices. The prices are basically determined by
middlemen who in most cases offer very low prices to farmers with due consideration to the costs of
production. The only opportunity that farmers have had to determine prices for their produce is when
they are organised and sell their produce in bulk in their groups. Unfortunately most of the smallholder
farmers operate on an individual basis and not in groups such as farmer associations or cooperatives.

16

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

In response to these and many other challenges, the Government of Malawi has put in place a policy
framework to guide stakeholders such as MLBP in the implementation of various development
strategies.

2.2 POLICY FRAMEWORK

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme is coherent with Malawi’s national development plans and priorities.
2.2.1 Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS)

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme is firmly in line with the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS). The MGDS embraces all the national development strategies and for the next five years, the
MGDS identifies six priority areas to achieve economic growth and increase welfare, namely; a)
agriculture and food security, b) irrigation and water development, c) transport infrastructure
development, d) energy generation and supply; e) integrated rural development, and f) prevention and
management of nutritional disorders, HIV and AIDS. Embedded in it is the Malawi poverty Reduction
Strategy (MPRS).

Officially launched in July 2007, the MGDS is centred on achieving strong and sustainable economic
growth where agriculture is a key sector, building a healthy and educated human resource base, and
protecting and empowering vulnerable communities.

On the issue of decentralisation, the MGDS emphasises on improved community participation in
development planning as a means of reducing conflicts among various stakeholders at the district level.
Finally, in line with the MGDS, the Malawi Lake Basin Programme recognises the importance of
integrating the rights, interests and participation of women, as well as the importance of addressing
issues of HIV and AIDS epidemic.

2.2.2 Decentralisation Policy

The decentralisation policy recognises that delegation of political powers and functional responsibilities
is closely linked to fighting poverty in Malawi. The Government of Malawi has taken a number of steps
towards decentralisation since the adoption of the Decentralisation Policy in 1998 and the passing of
Local Government Act by the National Assembly in the same year. The policy and act aim at an
integrated decentralisation, which implies shifting the locus of decision—making from the central sector
ministries to the local assemblies, with the District Assemblies as the key institutions at the local
government level. So far, decentralisation has been more oriented towards administrative
decentralisation than towards devolution of power and resources. In general terms, progress so far has
been slow at both national and sector levels.

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme reflects the challenges and needs articulated by the village sub—
district and district level representatives during the programme preparatory phase. In the coming period
it will continue consulting and collaborating with relevant government structures making sure that the
activities are in line with national and local development strategies and priorities.

The ADP and NAPA initiatives need to be look into the context of decentralisation. Both programmes
proclaim a multispectral responsibility mentioning the complementary effect of government, private
sector and civil society participation. Unfortunately there are very little practical considerations in term
of implementation and resource allocation to private sector and civil society. In practice, despite good
abstract intentions there are few indications that the government and/or some members of the donor
community are seriously considering the other two sectors as equal partners in the implementation of
these programmes. Without and active and vibrant participation of the civil society and the private
sector, there is a dangerous risk that important part of the resources are allocated to meeting,

17

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

conferences, networking, planning, vehicles and equipment for the strengthening or creation of new
national coordination structures rather than promoting and supporting practical interventions at district
and community level. The MLBP considers that the full participation of the local communities and their
field structures both in planning, monitoring but especially on the implementation of these programmes
is fundamental to achieve the expected results. The development approach of the MLBP provides good
possibilities to influence policy makers at national level on the need to involve the civil society in the
NAPA and ADP as well as the MLBP field structure provide a good platform to ensure that the local
government together with C305 and traditional structures play and active role in planning and
implementation of these initiatives at local level. The MLBP can indeed assume an important catalyst
role, at national as well as at local level on the incorporation and integration of the civil society into
these important initiatives.

2.2.3 The Current Agricultural Extension Policy

A new extension policy was finalised in 2000, and launched under the name: "Agricultural Extension in
the New Millennium: Towards Pluralistic and Demand—driven Services in Malawi”. The policy guidelines
indicate a shift from supply—driven to demand—driven extension service provision. The general
orientation of the agricultural extension policy is in line with the above—mentioned decentralisation
policy, with its aim to empower local level stakeholders to participate more effectively in decision—
making, programme development and implementation. In addition, the policy is also promoting
pluralism in the provision of extension services. Realising the limitations that government has been
experiencing in terms of maintaining adequate numbers of extension staff in order to ensure quality of
service provision, the policy is actually encouraging other providers to participate in extension service
provision. The Malawi Lake Basin Programme is actually being implemented at the right time in tandem
with this policy objective. The challenge now is to build upon what has been achieved in terms of
decentralising the responsibility for extension services and define a decentralisation process within the
agricultural sector.

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme aligns itself to existing structures at district level and work in close
collaboration with the district agriculture extension services system to avoid duplication and/or
overlapping of activities. The programme will continue promoting close collaboration between
government extension services, district authorities and farmer groups and organisations. At the district
level, farmer organisations are central to developing client—oriented extension services and fostering
empowerment of farmers and fishermen.

2.2.4 Malawi National Environmental Policy (NEP)

Following its concerns over the deterioration of the country’s natural resources, the Malawi Government
adopted a National Environmental Policy in 1996. The overall policy goal is the promotion of sustainable
social and economic development through the sound management of the environment and natural
resources. More specifically, the policy sought to:— a) promote the efficient utilization and management
of our natural resources; b) facilitate the rehabilitation and management of essential ecosystems and
ecological processes; c) enhance public awareness of the importance of sound environmental
management; and d) promote cooperation between government, local communities, and women
groups, non—governmental organizations and the private sector in the management and sustainable
utilization of the natural resources and the environment.

Experience over the past 12 years since the adoption of this policy has revealed that there are policy
gaps, conflicts and duplications which adversely affect effective implementation of the policies. These
developments and experiences have prompted Government to revise the NEP to ensure that it remains
current, respond to new challenges and incorporates lessons learnt. Among other matters, the revised
policy recognizes the importance of creating an enabling policy and legal framework for cross sector

18

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

coordination, participation of non state actors, strengthening the enforcement machinery and
decentralizing natural resources and environmental management and governance, thus cross sector
management.

2.2.5 NAPA — National Adaptation Programme of Action

The NAPA is a strategic government plan with the primary objective of identifying and promoting
activities that address urgent and immediate needs for adapting to the adverse impacts of climate
change among rural communities in vulnerable areas of the country. This will initially focus on the
adaptation needs in the agriculture, water, energy, fisheries, land use change and forestry, wildlife,
human health and gender sectors. NAPA identifies key sector for intervention, directly related and in
concordance with the objectives and implementation strategies for the MLBP:

Agricultural sector

Malawi relies on rain—fed agriculture, and the current droughts have resulted in poor crop yields or total
crop failure, leading to serious food shortages, hunger and malnutrition. Flooding has also severely
disrupted food production in several districts of the country. The proposed interventions include: (i)
improved early warning systems (ii) recommended improved crop varieties, (iii) recommended improved
livestock breeds, and (iv) improved crop and livestock management practices.

Human health sector

The human health sector is directly affected by climate change, and is especially linked to infant
malnutrition and chronic ailments associated with malaria, cholera and diarrhoea as a result of droughts
and floods. For example, malaria is expected to increase and spread to previous cool zones as
temperatures increase due to global warming. The proposed interventions include: (i) improved
nutrition for infants and other vulnerable groups, (ii) prevention of diseases, such as malaria, and
diarrhoea, (iii) water treatment, (iv) crop diversification and food supplementations for the under—fives.

Energy sector

The water flow disruptions in rivers have been exacerbated by siltation caused by poor and
unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, and noxious weeds, such as water hyacinth. Among
others the proposed interventions include: (i) diversification of energy sources, (ii) arresting siltation, (iii)
reducing dependence on wood fuel, and (iv) efficient use of charcoal and expanded use of ethanol
stoves.

Gender

Women bear most of the burden in activities that are most impacted by adverse climate. Several
interventions are proposed that target women in highly vulnerable situations, including: (i)
empowerment of women through access to microfinance to diversify earning potential, (ii) ensuring
easier access to water and energy sources by drilling boreholes and planting trees in woodlots, and (iii)
use of electricity provided through the rural electrification programme.

2.2.6 ADP - Agricultural Development Programme
According to the World Bank, agriculture in the let century continues to be a fundamental instrument

for sustainable economic development, food security and poverty reduction. In addition, agriculture is
known forjump—starting overall growth and can be a precursor to industrial transformation. Agriculture

19

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

has distinct potentials to reduce poverty in most agriculture—based countries such as Malawi. Estimates
show that GDP growth originating from agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as
GDP growth originating outside agriculture.

Given the important role of agriculture in reducing poverty as illustrated above, and also as a major
driver for the MGDS, the Malawi Government through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security has
initiated the Agricultural Development Programme (ADP), a precursor to the Sector Wide Approach
Program (SWAP). The ADP is a Government of Malawi’s initiative whose objectives and areas of focus
have been aligned to the two key African Union strategic frameworks aimed at transforming agricultural
development and stimulating economic growth of member states. These are the Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).

The ADP seeks to provide a framework for harmonized government and donor investment in the pursuit
of a prioritized development agenda in the agriculture sector. The overall objective of the ADP is to
increase food security at household and national level and to generate agricultural—led economic growth.
The ADP is built around three pillars. These are: a) food security and risk management; b) agri—business
and market development; and c) sustainable agriculture land and water management.

2.2.7 The Role of the MLBP in the NAPA and ADP

The ADP and NAPA initiatives need to be looked into in the context of decentralisation. Both
programmes proclaim a multispectral responsibility mentioning the complementary effect of
government, private Sector and civil society participation. Unfortunately there are very little practical
considerations in term of implementation and resource allocation to private sector and civil society. In
practice, despite good abstract intentions there are few indications that the government and/or some
members of the donor community are seriously considering the other two sectors as equal partners in
the implementation of these programmes. Without an active and vibrant participation of the civil society
and the private sector, there is a dangerous risk that important part of the resources are allocated to
meeting, conferences, networking, planning, vehicles and equipment for the strengthening or creation
of new national coordination structures rather than promoting and supporting practical interventions at
district and community level. The MLBP considers that the full participation of the local communities and
their field structures both in planning, monitoring but especially on the implementation of these
programmes is fundamental to achieve the expected results.

The development approach of the MLBP provides good possibilities to influence policy makers at
national level on the need to involve the civil society in the NAPA and ADP as well as the MLBP field
structure provides a good platform to ensure that the local government together with C305 and
traditional structures play and active role in planning and implementation of these initiatives at local
level. The MLBP can indeed assume a significant catalyst role, at national as well as at local level on the
incorporation and integration of the civil society into these important initiatives.

In line with its overall goal, the MLBP will specifically align itself with the agri—business and market
development pillar without necessarily neglecting the other two pillars. This is so because each of the
pillars can either influence or be influenced by the other hence they are interrelated. Such
interrelationships will therefore require an all inclusive approach, in pursuit of either of them. This will
be achieved through developing strategic linkages with MoAFS, the civil society and farmer organisations
in harmonising the implementation of the programs, consolidation of agricultural policies and
interventions at national level.

At district level, the program will actively participate in the district development committees bringing
the voice of the consortium members and facilitating the participation of smallholder. Through the
programme leaders are emerging and already taking decision making positions at VDC. Their views are
also necessary at district level to enable small producer to influence the planning and implementation of
ADP for the creation of a business—enabling environment.

20

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

Although programme interventions will directly target Mangochi and Salima, their output will be far
reaching as they will spread to the other districts in Malawi by way of spill—over effects through different
mechanisms employed by the programme. Examples include radio programmes, newspaper articles, TV
documentaries, to mention but some. Another means of outreach will be through the consortium
members’ involvement in the other districts apart from the two. Consequently, these will all contribute
to both the ADP and MLBP.

3 PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE FIRST
PERIOD

3.1 Core Problems

While remarkable positive changes in rural livelihoods of the people of Salima and Mangochi that have
been involved in MLBP activities within the past three years (MLBP 2008), the core problems that were
identified in the Programme Document (MLBP 2005) of limited productive capacity of farmers as well as
the to be the c e limited organizational capacity of farmers, fisher folk and their organization continue
to push the majority of farmers below the poverty line. In addition, the fight against poverty is
undermined by the adverse effects of global warming and climate change.

3.2 Rural Poverty

According to IFAD (2008) deeply entrenched poverty is a major obstacle to Malawi’s development and
growth. About 8 million people, or almost 70 per cent of Malawians, live below the national poverty line.
More than 90 per cent of them live in rural areas and depend on subsistence farming for their
livelihoods. Even in years when rainfall is adequate, 40 per cent of Malawian population do not have the
purchasing power to be able to satisfy their daily basic needs. Chronic poverty and repeated food crisis
have depleted their livelihoods.

Poverty weighs heaviest on children and mothers. One in five children dies before its fifth birthday.
Almost half of all children under five are chronically malnourished. Maternal mortality is among the
highest in the world.

Chronic malnutrition, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, substandard health services and lack of clean drinking
water have combined to drive average life expectancy in Malawi to 37 years. Because of the high death
rate, the population is very young: about 72 per cent of Malawians are under 25 years of age. Most
households are food secure only for eight to nine months of the year.

Inequalities between men and women further exacerbate poverty. The poorest households, in which
food insecurity is chronic, include proportionately more households headed by women, orphans and the
elderly and households caring for the chronically ill and fostering orphaned children. They also have
fewer assets, limited access to productive inputs and land, a greater burden of dependants and limited
opportunities for off—farm employment.

Although poverty is widespread, it is most severe in the southern and central regions. The densely
populated southern region has proportionately more poor households than the central and northern
regions. About 68 per cent of people living in the southern region are classified as poor and 32 per cent
as extremely poor. Landholdings in the south are smaller and more fragmented than those in other
regions. More than 45 per cent of households in the southern region are headed by women and has the
highest rates or rural illiteracy.

21

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

Lessons from the First Period

The first implementation period has shown that most of the programme beneficiaries range from poor
to very poor. Very poor people are categorised as vulnerable, a characteristic which reduces the
possibility for them to create conditions for economic growth. This is so because they react to the daily
causes of poverty at the expense of economic growth. The other dimension of poverty has been seen to
be 'poverty of the mind’ which deals with attitude and mentality of the people towards development.
Therefore the programme should continue focusing on influencing change of mindset and attitude to
ensure the beneficiaries have the right perception to long term development.

It is clear that poverty can not be only addressed at individual farmer or small group level. Tiny
interventions oriented to solve aspects of poverty affecting few persons or a reduced number of
households do not provide sufficient ground for development. It is also evident that not all poor people
are prepared and sufficiently committed to fight poverty and/or to work hard on the creation of
conditions for poverty reduction. A broader and more pragmatic approach will be adopted during the
coming period. That approach will include:

0 Focus on progressive and interested groups and individuals, dropping out every non—active and
conflictive participant

o Concentrate on production activities which are able to generate income but also employment
and marketing opportunities

0 Scale the promotion of added value technologies, moving from tests and demonstrations to
medium scale semi industrial enterprises. (Eco—brick making, oil extraction, solar drying, cassava
processing, honey processing commercial nurseries and green house production, etc).

o The Cooperative model will be promoted and exploited at maximum as a mean for economic
enterprise escalation and the development of entrepreneurship.

o Concentrate training and promotion of "business" to highly motivated groups and reward the
"graduated" groups or individuals with subsidised initial capital.

0 Incorporate "sustainable but productive farm management concept” into farming as business

0 Liaise with relevant institution to concentrate, in fishing communities, on organisation
development and increasing the productivity and profit margins in fisheries rather than intend
to transform fisher folk into farmers which may eventually become frustrated.

0 Attach, as early as in 2009 one micro finances field Officer (MUSCCO) and one marketing field
Officer (NASFAM) to Salima and Mangochi Districts to work fulltime with selected groups on the
scaling up of business development with the objective of speeding the formations of Rural
Cooperatives and /or other forms of profit oriented conglomerates.

3.3 Global Warming, Climate Change and Environmental
Degradation

Progress in fighting poverty in Malawi will increasingly be compromised by climate change.
Therefore in this new period adaptation to climate change becomes an integral part of the MLBP
poverty reduction strategy as the two are highly inter—related. According to the World Bank, many
greenhouse mitigation measures can have win—win outcomes for poverty reduction as well as
environmental conservation. Indeed, it is generally accepted that improved agricultural land
management practices like conservation tillage, agro forestry and rehabilitation of degraded crop
and pasture land; crop/livestock diversification; water harvesting; overall improvement of nutrition
and genetics of livestock; storage and capture technologies for manure; and conversion of emissions
into biogas are appropriated mitigation measures for adaptation to climate change. Adoptable

22

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

measures that complement these approaches include reforestation, energy saving technologies,
improved capture fisheries and aquaculture agro forestry and compost or manure making.

Adaptation to climate change is not only compatible but complementary to any other initiatives to
reduce poverty and the sustainability and resilience of rural livelihood will depend in high degree on
the capacity of the local communities to cope with those changes.

3.3.1 Impact of Climate Change in Malawi

Climate change is affecting a cross—section of sectors in Malawi ranging from agriculture, water
resources and energy to transport and health. However, the greatest driver of climate change is land
use, which although relatively small on a global scale, is still significant. Deforestation is by far the largest
source of C02 emissions in this context, releasing sequestered carbon into the atmosphere as a result of
burning and loss of forest/plant biomass. According to the Inter—governmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), the share of C02 originating from deforestation ranges between 11 and 28% of total emissions.

The hardest—hit are smallholder farmers whose livelihoods entirely dependent on agriculture. Projections
show that temperatures from global warming in Malawi will rise from 2—3°C by 2050, while rainfall and
water availability will decrease. This combination will result in a marked reduction in soil moisture, which
will lower the production potential of maize and other staples. A serious consequence is that episodes of
extreme food insecurity will become more frequent, a pattern that has been demonstrated in Malawi
over several years. This will impact 90% of Malawi’s smallholder farmers due to their reliance on rain fed
agriculture. The implications for human development can not be over—emphasized, the poor will be
disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of climate change because their livelihoods depend on
rainfall and their corresponding ability to adapt is limited.

Changes in climate make it more difficult for farmers to plan production and estimate costs. Continuous
droughts followed by period of flooding or unexpected dry spells within a normal year are becoming
common features increasing production risks as well as threatening the households’ welfare. On the
other hand, for many years, land pressure has been leading to vulnerable or non agriculture land being
opened up for farming, trees being cut down without replacement and soil being exhausted.

Deforestation is a serious and growing concern in Malawi. The rate of deforestation is estimated to be at
2.8 percent per annum and is one of the highest in the Sub—Saharan region. The driving forces are
population growth, land clearing for agriculture, uncontrolled burning, and high demands for wood and
charcoal. Over 90% of the population depends on wood fuel for cooking and heating because alternative
energy sources are either too expensive or unavailable. The demand accounts for 80% of the total wood
consumption in Malawi, which is estimated at 14 million cubic meters annually vs. a sustainable supply
of only 7 million. Consequently, heavy rains have been washing soil away from hillsides and riverbanks
causing increased erosion and silting of the lakes and rivers.

However, the MLBP understands that climate change adaptation is much more than the introduction of
technologies and new practices in agriculture and natural resources management. The effects of climate
changes have a strong socioeconomic connotation and must, systematically address the links between
livelihoods and climate. Any intervention must relay on the community and/or individuals’ adaptive
capacity to those changes. The effects of the development work should relate to the livelihood resilience
rather than to the technical efficiency of the intervention. Context—specific activities are required to
enhance the adaptive capacities of communities, enabling them to cope and combat the adverse
impacts of climate variability and change. In this context disaster prevention (early warning systems) is
as important as adaptation.

Climate adaptation for MLBP basically means reducing the vulnerability of peoples’ livelihoods — socially,
economically and environmentally from the effects of changes in climate. It means prevention,

23

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

preparedness and human and technical capability to cope with climate related catastrophes as well as
keeping focus on slow onset adversities, on new environmental conditions and other system related
alterations due to slow changes in the climate. Some of the coping mechanisms will to a large extent
depend on how fisheries and water resources are being used.

The collaboration initiated with the other two Norwegian supported programmes namely the Chia
Watershed Management Project by Total Land Care, and the Food Security / Sustainable Livelihoods
Project of FAQ will acquire more concrete character both in term of planning, implementation and
monitoring of activities. It is expected that the draft "A Strategic Framework to support adaptation to
climate change among rural communities in Malawi" will be soon reviewed and adopted. The final
document will provide important guidance to the programme in this area.

Lessons from the First Period

Most farmers are well aware that there is change in climate partly attributed to deforestation.
Unreliable rainfall patterns (too much leading to floods or too little leading to drought), extreme
temperatures leading poor crop yield, persistent hunger, disease outbreak (water born diseases) etc
were cited as some of the effects of climate change.

Despite the awareness about climate change, farmers need more specific trainings on how to prevent
and mitigate the effects of global warming/climate changes.

The experience gained during this period implies a further strengthening of the sub programme of
agriculture, fisheries and community management of natural resources as well as specific actions in
prevention and adaptation of rural livelihood to the effect of global warming and climate change. Agro—
forestry, soil and water management, integrated and organic farming, tree planting, energy saving
technologies and organic/mineral recycling should cross—cut every intervention in this sub programme.

The improvement of people’s habitat should be part of that strategy incorporating methods of brick—
making less dependent on firewood, energy saving stoves and environmentally sound water harvesting
and purification. More resources should be allocated to awareness campaigns, civic education and
promotion of Community management of changes in climate.

|f resources are made available, the work initiated with the introduction of legumes crops as well as agro
forestry plants for soil improvement, firewood production as well as livestock feed will be expanded to
each and every field reached by the programme through an intensive and systematic awareness
campaign, massive and individual training, increasing on the establishment of individual and collective
nurseries, introduction of multipurpose trees like Jatropha and Moringa. Bamboo will also be
incorporated to complement the agro forestry and forestry interventions.

The increase soil and water productivity will strongly be based on the utilisation of the organic capability
of the land, reducing the utilisation of inorganic fertilisers, supplemented with less costly agricultural
inputs including recycling of wastes, compost making, green manure and the use of bio catalysts as well
as biological control of pest and diseases.

However, adaptation to climate change is not the solo responsibility of individual farmers and rural
population. The fact that the issue has a clear Natural Resource Management connotation, the role of
National Civil Society organisations in the area of policy influence can not be over emphasised. The MLBP
is there to provide resources to NASFAM, MUSCCO and FUM to increase institutional awareness and
competence in that area.

It is evident that working in isolation reduces the effectiveness of individual programmes, it is

therefore suggested that the MLBP acquires a catalyst role on the coordination, synergies,
monitoring and evaluation of the three Norwegian supported Livelihood Improvement programmes

24

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

linking the MLBP/Chia Lagoon/FAO collective experience in the area of Climate Change, to the NAPA
and other civil society initiatives.

The Consortium Model

As has been observed by review team of the first three years of implementation of the MLBP (Kaunda et
al 2008), the consortium model remains an interesting and innovative aspect of the programme, and
more effort has been put into making the contributions of each of the partner visible. There is some
evidence of consolidation of the relationship and cooperation between the implementing organisations,
including through a Partnership Agreement. Plans about closer integration of staff from Malawian
institutions at field office level also seem an interesting move.

The development of partnership is key to the sustainability of any programme. In the MLBP project
document partnership is defined as 'a relationship that unites the two or more organisations in open,
collective efforts towards development in an atmosphere of mutual trust and acceptance, with shared
accountability for reaching common goals’ (MLBP 2005:87). Which ever definition is used, 'a true
partnership implies joint effort throughout the process, i.e., during context analysis and problem
identification, formulation of strategies, monitoring progress and evaluating success’ (Meyer, Mede &
Ntata 2006: 8).

Following the six action areas of education, joint planning, assessment and accountability, Teaming,
multilevel human resources strategy and technology that Coble & Williams 1998 (quoting Henderson
1990) listed the MLBP is on its way to achieving all the tenets for successful partnership where there is
active joint planning process and multilevel human development strategy through staff exchanges have
been characteristics of the partnership in the past three years. Considering that such partnerships take
time to mature, the next phase is seen as a period in which the partnership will improve and become
sustainable to work beyond the project life span. Indeed, it is expected that through this consortium
model the farmers from perspective of organization capacity, marketing and technology implementation
will be fully enhanced.

5.0 PROGRAMME STRATEGY

The programme will be composed of three major components as Agriculture, Fisheries, Natural
Resources and Adaptation to Climate Change, Organisation and business development and Institutional
Development of consortium and farmer member organizations.

5.1 SUB-PROGRAMME 1: Organisation and Business
Development

This component involves organisational, business development and governance with a major focus on
sound organisational leadership and provision of efficient services to the members such as agricultural
input, produce marketing systems and rural financial services.

Transformation of subsistence economy and household production into cash economy, commercial
agriculture and market oriented production is one of the mayor aspirations of this component. Less
poor, emergent producers and selected local entrepreneurs are the main target. In a more long—term
perspective, empowering and strengthening the policy influencing capacity of farmers and fishermen
would also be a part of this component. The programme will ensure that women’s rights, interests and
participation are properly integrated in policy and programmes.

5.1.1 Sub-Programme Objective

The objective ofthis sub—programme is:

““Smallholder producers are organised and enabled to inﬂuence policies and
transform their economies into proﬁtable and viable businesses. ”

5.1.1.1 Expected Outputs

The following specific outputs will be expected under this sub—programme:

0 Target groups more involved in commercial production and/or other economic
enterprises.

0 Producer associations and cooperative societies in target areas Established

General improvement in income, assets and services among target groups.

0 The presence of Democratic farmers’ organisations with representative structures at
national, district and local level increased.

0 Member based farmers’ organisations more capacitated to analyse, develop and
influence agricultural and fishing policies.

0 Equitable access to opportunities, active participation, services and programme benefits
for men, women and youth promoted

0 HIV and AIDS infected target groups enabled to participate and share social and
economic welfare.

5.1.2 Justification for the Sub-Programme

Malawi is one of the least—developed countries in the world where the incidence of poverty is
relatively high. According to the Malawi Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (2006) more than
half of the population (52 percent) lived below the poverty line in 2005 and about one fifth (22
percent) lived in extreme poverty. This meant that about 6.4 million Malawians were living in
poverty and as many as 2.7 million Malawians, about one in every five people, were living in
extreme poverty that they could not afford to meet even the daily—recommended food
requirements

Results from the Malawi Integrated Household Survey (IHS) conducted in 2005, show that 52.4% of the
population was poor as their consumption fell below the national poverty line of MK43.45 per capita per
day. The prevalence of poverty seems not to be declining. By international standards, about 70% of
Malawi’s population lives on less than US$1.00 per day. The proportion of the poor in total population in
Malawi appears to be higher than in a number of countries in East and Southern Africa. In Malawi,
poverty incidence was higher in rural areas (57.8%) as compared to urban centres (28.1%).

The 2008 population and housing census recorded a population of about 13 million people with 85%
(over 8 million) living in the rural areas. About 17% of the population enumerated were under—five
children and approximately 50% were aged 18 years and above.)

One of the key causes of poverty in Malawi is the high level of illiteracy, which is estimated at about 42%
of the adult population. Illiteracy negatively affects agricultural production, uptake of innovations and
technologies, economic empowerment, education of children, family health and good governance.

Income security will move rural poor from poverty to economic empowerment. In order to have a focus

on livelihoods and poverty, a strategy of combining a business oriented model with proper attention and
assistance to marginalised and vulnerable groups and individuals should be implemented as discussed in

28

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

the lessons learned study (Kaunda et al 2007).1 Further, Kaunda et al. (2008) noted in the MLBP
Evaluation Report that the activities that were introduced to empower the farmers and move them from
poverty needed to be scaled while making use of expertise available within the consortium.

Despite varying amount of resources allocated to train farmers in the first pilot phase, the following are
still noted from the evaluation of the programme:

0 Collective marketing, business development and economic growth are fully dependent on the
degree of organisation.

0 Less than 50% of the members of the clubs understand the concept of farming as business and
business planning, most probably due to high illiteracy level contributing to low levels of
understanding and practicing.

0 Both farmers and programme own staff has difficulties to understand business and marketing
concepts, necessitating further training.

0 Both organisation and business concepts require strong and sound leadership for the farmers to
fully enjoy their benefits. With good leadership some groups have managed to maintain their
membership, others increased and registered high returns.

0 Better organisation and additional training is needed on bulk production, collective marketing,
negotiation skills etc. backed up by sufficient marketing information.

o The marketing committees that have been established at club, cluster and EPA levels require a
lot of training to equip them with the necessary skills which the programme will continue to
organize under the coordination of NASFAM.

0 Farmers tend to look at the programme as a source of immediate relief rather than a
development actor or facilitator when such a programme implements a strategy where
provision of input supplies is a major feature.

0 Social economic interdependence between agriculture and fisheries still shows that female
headed households are disadvantaged in all respects as compared to male headed households,
implying to continue with special activities oriented not only to reduce gender disparities, but
specifically targeting women issues which make it difficult for their development possibilities

From the foregoing, it is important that for the sustainability purposes, the programme should consider
issues of farmer empowerment through income security, organisational skills for business development,
supported by financial services and market development. It is also important that in all these aspects or
strategies, serous consideration should also be given to up—scaling or supporting gender mainstreaming/
empowerment as well as the mitigation of the negative impacts of HIV and AIDS.

5.1.3 Strategy for implementing Organisation and business
development

5.1.3.1 Farmer Empowerment and Income Security

As part of empowerment and income security, MLBP was effective in delivering in key aspects of
livelihoods including food security and income generation as well as natural resource management. A
number of technologies including brick making, oil extraction, tree planting, livestock production, agro—
forestry, carpentry, bee keeping, soybean, sunflower, maize, sunflower growing, cassava planting pigeon
peas, Sorghum, finger millet, sesame, rice, sweet potato were successfully been introduced. These

together with training seem to have inculcated a business culture in the communities. The diversity of
these activities on one hand is good as response to adaptation to climate change, but which on the
other, does not allow adequate investment of time and other resources for a 'quantum leap” for farmers
from poverty to wealth. All the economic activities named above started during the part of the three
year pilot phase and are still at small scale to make economic sense, and will therefore be scaled up
during the next 5 years. In addition, the GSLs which have made a considerable impact on farm families,
will graduate from GSLS to SACCOS.

5.1.3.2 Scaling up the present status

The past effort has seen the introduction of the Business Development (BD) at club level, whose success
has seen the adoption of the concept and development of Business Plans by all clubs within the
program. Considering that the BP is the road map to the success of the any production and fisheries
enterprise, and its further enhancement at household, cluster and Association level will compliment to
the sustainability of the program as a whole. To achieve this, the study circles will be used to enrich the
BD concept at household level, also strengthening the Group Saving and Loans (GSL) concept which will
promote financial recycling, amongst individual the farmers, from investing, generating profit and saving
as well.

The BD concept will further be consolidated at cluster level through trainings and extending the
responsibilities of the cluster committees to champion the adoption of the business development
programs in all clubs. The Association which be served by the members from the clubs, study circle
inclusive, has also to embrace the BD concept in all its programs in supporting the concept at household,
club, and cluster levels. The program will review and enrich its training materials to integrate the BD
concept, build on the club’s BP to enhance understanding, promote the collective marketing programs
and develop a profile of small and medium businesses which fits very well in the program geographical
areas for farmer guidance.

5.1.3.3 Organisation and business development

As the saying goes 'the future belongs to the organized’, only people who are organized are better
placed to achieve their goals. Institution building and organizational development will provide rural
people’s organizations the capacity to offer efficient services to their members and constituencies and to
adequately defend the socio—economic and political interests of their members. Proper enterprise
selection, business plan development, implementation and monitoring will help to support farming as
business culture.

Leadership development, strengthening the voice of farmers and fishermen to avoid exploitation by
middlemen and empowering them to become active citizens, more enlightened about their rights, roles
and responsibilities in society would also be a major part of this component.

5.1.3.4 Financial Services and marketing development

Financial services and marketing are essential pillars of the agricultural production cycle. In the first
three years, these took shape as seen through market linkages fostered by NASFAM and the convincing
results in the GSL implementation led by MUSCCO, where by mid 2008 clubs mobilized over half a
million Malawi kwacha in communities where savings mobilization was deemed impossible.

The next phase of the programme will place emphasis on interventions that lead farmers on the
sustainability path by empowering farmers to negotiate for better markets and enlightenment to save in
a convenient financial services facility. This strategy will be implemented by MUSCCO and NASFAM

30

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

based on the experiences observed elsewhere. This may also have made other local organizations in
other districts become integral part of the MLBP.

5.1.3.5 Gender Mainstreaming and Women Empowerment
(WOLREC)

Gender mainstreaming is an often—used phrase, particularly in donor and international communities. It
involves assessing the implications for women, men, youth, the aged and others of any planned action,
with gender equality being the ultimate goal. However, it is frequently used as a euphemism or
development cliché, often misunderstood and ignored in practice. The MLBP seriously looks at gender
mainstreaming as a global strategy for promoting gender equality. Gender mainstreaming for the MLBP
is not an end in itself but an approach to achieve gender equality with the intention that gender
perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities — resource allocation,
planning, implementation and monitoring of programme’s activities.

To fight the consequences of current discrimination the MLBP includes gender—specific activities,
whenever women or men are in a particularly disadvantageous position. Gender—specific interventions
can target women exclusively, men and women together or only men, to permit them to participate in
and benefit equally from development efforts bringing the experience, know how, and interests of
women and men that have a bearing on the development agenda.

Despite the prevalent matriarchal society in Malawi like anywhere else, women face a higher risk of
poverty than men. Discrimination against women in social practices results in their over—representation
among the poor. As a consequence of their subordinate position, women also encounter larger
difficulties than men in surviving and defeating poverty. In addition, household and family
responsibilities assigned to women mean that the experience of poverty is different for women than
men. Therefore the MLBP poverty reduction strategy takes account of the differences between women
and men in resources and opportunities, and includes measures to address the factors that particularly
constrain women.

Community gender imbalances are skewed to the disadvantage of women. This requires the programme
to elaborate and initiate the implementation of a long—term strategy for women’s empowerment,
including removal of the factors that particularly constrain women, as an essential step for poverty
elimination. Special resources have been put aside for this purpose and special activities will be
undertaken in collaboration with the Women’s Legal Resource Centre — WOLREC. This partnership has
already shown positive results (see Kaunda et al 2008).

5.1.3.6 Prevention and mitigation of the effects of HIV and AIDS

Lack of education raises the vulnerability of the affected groups and limits their participation in
economic activities. Hence, strengthening the provision of education to farmer groups in the country is
one of the key elements to the attainment of "Education for All by the Year 2015” and Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The achievement of these key goals is pivotal to the poverty reduction
strategies as stipulated in the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) and the Malawi
Economic Growth Strategies (MEGS).

The effects of HIV and AIDS impact more on women than men, for instance looking after the sick.
Promotion of gender equity will therefore be central towards ensuring that both men and women take
an active role in handling HIV/AIDS related consequences.

Owing to the character of the programme, we work more with mitigation than prevention of HIV and
AIDS. Mitigation measures by the programme shall include support to orphans, widows, the HIV/ AIDS
infected and affected groups. For prevention, the programme will collaborate with institutions such as

31

AIDS Support Organizations (ASOs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs), which have got the
prerequisite skills and capacity.

5.1.4 Proposed Activities for Organisation and business

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

5.2.4 Justification

Agriculture continues to be considered as the key driver of the economy of Malawi and the need to
increase revenue from the sector can not be over emphasised. Within the framework of the sub
programme of "Agriculture, Fisheries and Community management of natural resources” of the first
three years, MLBP undertook several activities including crop production afforestation, agro forestry and
other non farm activities such as brick making as was. Furthermore some clubs were involved in off—farm
income generating activities such as beekeeping, fish farming, carpentry and tailoring proposed in the
programme document of 2005 (MLBP 2005). The concept of "farming as a business’ was inculcated in
farmers as programme staff facilitated farmers to development of business plans. According to the
assessment 2008 (Kaunda et al 2008), the programme component was successfully implemented but
needed to scale up in most of the activities so that tangible income benefits are realised. For instance,
the team found that the number and level of fish farms too low to allow for meaningful profits. Besides,
while study tours and farmers visits have been to various fisheries institutions the team suggested that
the Programme should link up with members of Innovative Fish Farmers Trust (|FFNT) who have practical
experience and knowledge in taking fish farming as a business venture. Interestingly |FFNT is a member
of FUM, one of the consortium partner institutions.

Fish from Lakes (in particular from Lake Malawi) is the single most important source of protein in
Malawi, contributing about 60—70 percent of national animal protein. The sector directly employs
300,000 people and over 1.5 million people derive their income from fishing, fish processing, marketing,
boat and gear making. However, due to over—exploitation, the total production has declined
dramatically over the last 15 years from a peak production of 80,000 tonnes per year in the 1990’s to
50,000 tonnes per year in the late 1990’s. The decline in landings have led to fish scarcity, high prices
which have made fish unaffordable for the poor, and has put the livelihoods of 3000 fishermen at risk.
The decline in fish production and the high prices of fish have led to decreased per capita consumption
of fish from 13 kg per year in the 1980’s to the current average per capita consumption of 7.5kg per
year. The current per capita consumption is about half that recommended by the World Health
Organisation.

Further, the decline in fish catches has contributed to non—compliance to regulations, the use of illegal
small meshed gears and evolution of a variety of destructive fishing gears which restrict fishing to
shallower areas. It is stated that more than 90 percent of the fish caught in Lake Malawi (on the
Malawian side) is landed by artisanal fishermen. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to rely on
fishing as a source of livelihood. Sustainable use of fish resources will ensure availability of cash income
from fish sales for rural communities during the period when income from crops is low due to unreliable
weather such as drought thereby providing the communities with cash as alternative means of buying
staple food. The sustainability of fisheries relay on the capacity of fishermen to reinvest fisheries
revenues into more sound fishing practices but also into household saving and off—the —lake
enterprises.

The national goal of the Fisheries Department to reverse the declining fish production and the negative
socio—economic impact that have arisen from depletion of fish stocks. In the early 19905 the Fisheries
Department introduced the concept of Participatory Fisheries Management wherein Beach Village
Committees (BVCs) were introduced to co manage the fishery particularly in the South East Arm of Lake
Malawi and around Lake Malombe. In essence these need strengthening so that disaster resilient
communities through strengthening the social resilience are created.

In addition to the low fish production, the high degree of nature resources degradation is another
concern for Malawi. For instance, the rate of deforestation, which refers to the percentage cover of lost
per year, ranged from 1 % to about 3 % overall, averaging 2.3% in recent years (1998), the highest in
Southern region and representing a loss of some 30 000 to 40 000 hectares per year of woodland in
Malawi. Much of the current deforestation occurs in indigenous forests and woodland. Unfortunately,
community structures such as the Village Development Committee (VDC), Forestry Development
Committee (FDC), and Natural Resource Management Committees (NRMC) are mostly dying of
inactivity. The lack of resources is usually used as a reason for their dormancy when in most cases the

35

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

real cause appear to be related to incapacity and general misunderstanding of their role. Often the local
politicians also undermine the possibility to fulfill their mandate, especially in relation to the FDC and the
NRMC. Like previously expressed the political activism in the area, instead of empower local populations,
in many cases is claimed to undermine the possibility that traditional authorities have to represent the
interest of their people.

The depletion of natural resources such as natural forests only exacerbates the magnitude and effect of
climate change. Climate change continues to threaten the future survival of most farm families and
would compromise any gains made in empowering farmers. According to FAO (2008) the risks and
vulnerabilities of the poor who live in insecure places and need to build their resilience to cope with
climate fluctuations are among the most important challenges in adapting to climate change.
Incidentally, in the first years of the MLBP the programme responded to calls to align to climate change,
by introducing agro forestry technologies to enhance land productivity i.e. use of leguminous tree
species that are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen like Tephrosia candida, Gliricidia sepium and the native
msangu tree. In addition, mixed cropping of cereal crops with leguminous plants like pigeon peas,
ground nuts and others were encouraged. In Nansenga area about 1500 beneficiary farmers of the
programme were issued with Tephrosia candida seed to be directly planted together with maize. In 2006
/O7, some farmers were also provided with Tephrosia. Quoting one of the farmers,

‘The 3 week dry spell we had in February has left three quarters of all my crops especially soya
beans dry. But on the small piece of land where I planted Tephrosia last year, amazingly has not
been aﬂected. The soya looks very green and healthy. Unfortunately, this year I have failed to
plant more Tephrosia seed issued to me by the programme due to negligence. I will not fail next
year because I have seen it for myself that this T ephrosia is a wonderful tree. ’Mrs. Nkhoma, the
chairlady of Atupele club observed. ( Source MLBP 2007)

The importance of climate change will lead to intensification of activities within MLBP to take advantage
of alternative risk—coping productive livelihood opportunities for income and employment generation in
order to decrease the pressure on land, forests and Lake Malawi. Of particular focus will be water
impoundment, agro forestry and integrated organic oriented farming. In complex situation of poverty
due to decrease in soil fertility and climate change, conservation agriculture and organic agriculture that
combines zero or minimum tillage with permanent soil coverage are good adaptation options to increase
soil organic carbon reducing the need of inorganic fertilization should be promoted.

5.2.5 Proposed Strategies for Implementing Agriculture,
Fisheries and Climate Change

The following strategies will be applied to deliver the desired outputs:

5.2.5.1 Sustainable and business oriented agriculture

0 The strategy will entail sustainable and Risk—coping Market Oriented agriculture. The experience
calls for an intensification of improved agricultural production and agriculture related
technologies that add value. Thus, diversification, non—seasonal production and introduction of
high value crops and other technologies in the system such as oil extraction, use of driers to
preserve food products for long term use and value adding will continue. This thrust is in line
with the key priority areas of technology development and dissemination as stated in the ADP.

o A variety of agricultural activities in the form of enterprise development to improve income
generation activities will include use of improved crop varieties for high yielding, disease and
drought resistant, early maturing; application of compost and manure as a cheap means of
supplying required nutrients by crops; agro forestry for improved soil fertility, cheap and rich

36

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

source of animal feed; and soil erosion control, irrigation farming and rain water harvesting for
extended production.

0 Other non—farming activities that were carried out during the first phase to improve incomes of
households will be expanded. These include bee keeping as well as food processing technologies
such as oil extraction, solar drying for long term storage and value adding.

0 The strategy to integrate field crops, livestock, fruits and irrigated vegetable growing to
maintain soil fertility, maximise productivity and minimise production and market risks will be
promoted

o The strategy to introduce massively, small livestock (goats, sheep, pigs, poultry, and rabbits) and
selectively introduce cattle will create new livelihood opportunities from income from the
animals but will also allow for a more organic oriented farming to improve of soil structure as
well as the introduction of pastures, trees and live fences in the system.

0 As was started in the first phase, a multi—prong approach to disseminate information proved
useful as will be continued: use of demonstration plots, group commercial agricultural
enterprises, farmer visits.

0 The use of model farms will continue as a collective ground for learning. As an innovation from
the first phase, a simplified integrated model will adapted to individual plots of the most
progressive member of model farm groups.

5.2.5.2 Sustainable Management of Fisheries and Other Natural
Resources

0 Empower local community structures, with enough time and resources to strengthen VDC
and other community based organisations working in close collaboration with traditional
and District authorities.

0 Work closely with local extension system and local development initiatives by NGOs
working in the areas of fisheries and NRM with the aim to strengthening the capacity of
community structures on NRM e.g. BVC and VNRMCs to effectively manage their resources

0 Engage all consortium members to upscale less capital—intensive income generating options
e.g. bee keeping that enhances and value of natural resources such as forests but which
brings income to farming communities

0 Engage in fish farming activities e.g. small scale cage culture, in liaison with major fish
farming companies such as MALDECO and the Fisheries Department (on policy) to enhance
fish production among artisanal fisher folk

0 Upscale pond fish culture activities in liaison with IFFNT members

5.2.5.3 Adaptation to Climate Change

The strategic approach will be to increase the resilience or improve people’s capacity to live with the
increased uncertainty in climate and support them to take advantage of opportunities that might arise.

0 To improve water management through agro forestry and integrated organic oriented farming
so as to increase water holding capacity of the soil.

0 Resources permitting, construct water impoundments, wells, river water diversion, small dams,
rain water harvesting structures, and wells to safeguard farmers against drastic effects of

37

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

drought as well as to extend the production season to more lucrative enterprises during the dry
season

To conserve and controlled utilisation of wetlands (dambos) which are fundamental for people’s
survival being source of water supplies, livestock grazing and crop cultivation during drought
period. Wetlands systems do maintain other ecosystems. They act as water reservoir and
climate regulators due to their high humidity and evapo transpiration rate. Evapotranspiration
of wetlands does not conduce to losses but to redistribution of water resources in catchment
areas. In addition, some wetlands supply downstream or adjacent systems with nutrients
allowing development of organisms in far away regions. Finally, wetlands also contribute to
water purification and prevent or limit the eutrophication of downstream lakes.

Engage in carbon sequestration where opportunities to engage in selling carbon credits on the
world market will be investigated. The consortium member ViAF has embarked on the scheme.

Make strategic alliances with other institutions including NGOs with like programmes such as
TLC and FAQ in innovative climate adaptation initiatives such as carbon sequestration; Bunda
College and University of Life Sciences on new adaptive mechanisms

5.3 SUB-PROGRAMME 3: INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

This sub—programme will concentrate on the strengthening of the three national organisations
addressing selected issues of their strategic development plans in order to increase their operational as
well as lobbying and advocacy capacity to generate institutional changes in the agriculture sector in term
of policies, norms, rules and governance to create an enabling business environment for small
producers. The success of the ADP, the effective implementation of NAPA and the regional vision of the
MLBP require strong farmers’ organisations able to mobilise democratic groups and represent, not only
the national interest of their members but also be capable of influencing regional policies.

39

 

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

As opposed to only focusing only on community level farmer organisations as was the case in the first
phase, this sub—programme will focus on both the capacity of consortium member organizations at
national level as well as formation and strengthening of the former. Lessons drawn from the first phase
show that the Malawian consortium member organizations can play very crucial roles in lobbying and
advocating for interests of local communities in areas of food security, agricultural marketing and in
financial empowerment. The activities of this sub—programme will help to strengthen the capacity of
these organizations to mobilize farmers and local community members to be empowered and have a
strong voice. The activities in this sub—programme will also play a very important role in strengthening
local community organizations to be more pro—active and shape the destiny of their future.

5.3.1 Sub-programme Objective

The objective of this sub programme is:

“To strengthen the capacity of Malawian Consortium members to generate institutional
changes for the improvement of the business environment and gain own competence in
business development for smallholders’ producers.”

5.3.2 Expected outputs

The following outputs will be delivered under this sub programme:

0 Improved institutional framework to create conducive business environment for smallholders.

0 Improved mobilisation of democratic organisations at grass roots level.

0 Improved ability of grass root organizations to lobby and influence policy as well as to fully
participate in the ADP process

0 Increased organizational competence of national consortium organizations to fulfil their roles in
the MLBP

0 Increased organizational competence of national consortium organizations.

0 Improved financial sustainability

5.3.3 Indicators of success

0 Ability of national consortium members to lobby, advocate and influence institutional
changes in the agricultural sector.

0 Institutional changes in policies, norms, laws, resource allocation benefiting
smallholders business environment

0 Number of democratic farmer organisations mobilised

0 Number of policies and ADP activities influenced by grass root organisations.

0 Number of farmer organisations mobilised with access to marketing and financial
services in targeted areas

0 Cost effectiveness and administrative efficiency

0 Number of sources and volume of funding for consortium organisations

5.3.4 Justification for the Sub-Programme

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme provides long—term commitment to sustainable rural livelihoods
development in Malawi focusing on building lasting capacities and results recognising the need for a
learning process—approach, where incentives to use information for learning purposes are built in.

The success of the programme will, in high degree, depend on the ability and capacity existing in the
consortium member organisations and the individual as well as the collective competence of the staff.

40

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

The holistic and interdisciplinary characteristic of the programme demand team work and collective
responsibility. The composition of the group, the different ages, technical background and sex of the
individual members must be transformed into capacity assets rather than being a hindrance to
collaboration. The concept of "team" goes beyond the programme own personnel. They must be and
feel part of a broader "development team” comprised of government and MBO officials, NGOs
personnel and the population themselves.

The consortium member organisations have specific roles to play both within the MLBP and in their
individual organisations. One lesson drawn from the first phase of the MLBP is that the roles of the
individual consortium members whether done within the MLBP areas or not, tends to have influence on
the MLBP farmers and community members. A good example is the role that FUM played in advocating
and influencing the maize marketing ban. This role was played not specifically targeting MLBP farmers
and community members but for all Malawians but has had a lot of effect on MLBP farmers as well.
Similarly, the activities of MUSCO in promoting the establishment of SACCOs will soon provide
opportunity for graduating the group savings and loans for MLBP farmers. And the activities of NASFAM
in promoting farming as a business and marketing activities will result in having a great impact on MLBP
farmers and community members. It is therefore very important to support the development and
implementation of strategic plans for these organisations as that will directly have impact on the MLBP
impact areas. The roles of the national consortium members are as described below:

MUSCCO

MUSCCO is a lead organization in development and provision of financial services on the programme,
and has a national mandate to promote, develop and support Savings and Credit Cooperative (SACCO)
on a sustainable basis to provide access to quality and affordable financial services to its members in
accordance with international cooperative principles. a community based financial institution called for
enterprising farmer clubs.

The Role of SACCOS in Rural Financial Services

The Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (MUSCCO) was established on 15th September
1980 to service and support Savings and Credit Cooperatives Societies (SACCOs) in Malawi. Its mission is
to support SACCOs in Malawi on sustainable basis to provide quality and affordable financial services to
members in accordance with the International Cooperative Principles.

MUSCCO’s strength is that, it is a nationally established organization, servicing both urban and rural
SACCOs which enable it to roll out its programmes to the lower segment of the Malawi population
through a variety of community propelled approaches such as Study Circle Methodology for community
empowerment and Group Savings and Loans for sustainable rural community based financial services.
SACCOs have managed to domestically mobilize savings totalling MK 1,249,475,373.17 and a loan
portfolio of MK 1,129,570,12235

Lessons Leant from the ﬁrst period Group Savings and Loans as Precursors of SACCOS

Efficient and productive rural enterprises demand a strong organisational component. The MLBP has
successfully introduced a methodology called Group Savings and Loans (GSL) from the original Village
Savings and Loans (VSL) widely being practiced by sister programmes in Eastern Africa which need to be
strengthened in the next phase. This is a purely Community—Managed Microfinance (CMMF) suited to
smallholder farmers whose income earning pattern is erratic.

GSL is a small—scale community managed financial institution whose basic principle is that members of a
self selected group, usually from the adult population, voluntarily form a group and save money through
purchasing of shares. The primary purpose of a GSL group is to provide simple savings and loan facilities
in a community that does not have access to formal financial services. The savings are invested in a loan
fund from which members can borrow and repay at an agreed affordable interest rate with the purpose
of growing the fund. Embedded in the methodology is also a community managed insurance service

41

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

called Social Fund which is aimed at assisting group members during emergencies such as funeral,
sickness and accidents at no interest.

Results of the Evaluation of the first three years indicate successful introduction of GSLs with the MLBP
with a total saving of more that MKl million within a period of 1 year. To this end, the programme
intends to use this methodology as a precursor for establishment of SACCOs. To achieve this objective,
once GSLs reach a level of maturity, after three successful cycles (three years), they will be linked to an
existing SACCO operating in the area or in areas where there are no SACCOs, a new SACCO will
established by bringing the various GSLs together. Going by this approach, GSLs become reliable entry
points (precursors) for establishment of community based financial institution.

To enable MUSCCO fulfil these mandates, resources will be required to support the following
interventions;

o SACCO Membership Mobilization
0 IT infrastructure development support to SACCOs and MUSCCO (both hardware and software)
0 Support for Human Resource Development both at MUSCCO and SACCO level

MUSCCO will therefore implement the following activities in the consortium:

0 To carry out community mobilization and membership retention campaigns

0 Radio Programmes

0 TV Programmes

0 Targeted membership mobilization meetings

0 Publicity materials production

0 To support programme implementation

0 Programme staff salaries

0 Vehicle maintenance

0 Telecommunication and stationery

0 Audit fees

0 Procurements

0 To enhance capacity of SACCO personnel

0 Governance training sessions

0 Financial Management training sessions

0 General Management training sessions

0 In country exchange visits

0 Inspection and Monitoring visits
NASFAM

NASFAM, a farmer organisation that advocates farming as a business through farmer based business
organisations. The increasing demand for its services puts pressure on the existing resources and
additional support is vital to compliment its role in the consortium.

In addition to improving farm productivity there is a need to integrate crop, livestock, and value added
agro—processing and product diversification. Moreover, agricultural practices and marketing
arrangements remain inefficient and there is still insufficient finance for smallholder production. More
generally, smallholders face growing land, capital and human capital constraints. Marketing constraints
also persist and rural infrastructure is poor.

42

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

In an unstable macroeconomic environment, farmers and entrepreneurs avoid taking risks, preferring to
scale down activities and shunning uncertain markets. Weaknesses in rural organizations, agricultural
technology and markets, and limited opportunities for non—farm employment further hinder
development. The programme will continue emphasizing the importance of savings and credit,
diversification of production, introduction of high value commodities, post harvesting and food
processing technologies. Marketing information, development of business plans, local marketing
development and intensive training will also be intensified in coming year. Further the development of
model farm enterprises, both crops and livestock based, has become an important element on
promoting farming as business.

Lessons from the First period

Changing farmer’s attitude is a long term process. Considerable effort has been made in the first three
years to inculcate the culture of "farming as a business” among the farmers. While less than 50% of the
members of the clubs understand the concept of farming as business and business planning it expected
that with more concentrated effort, much change will be made.

The first and most obvious lesson of the period is that the development of local market systems and the
possibility of farmers to influence agriculture trade remains a challenge. The market is definitely not
driven by the supply and demand of products and services but often by the exploitation of defenseless
small producers by a small group of unscrupulous buyers. The negotiation skills shown by farmers are
completely non—sufficient to handle the opportunities offered by local marketing. On the other hand, the
increase in marketing handling capacity of rural producers must go hand in hand with the capacity to
produce good quantities of good quality products able to compete in the open market.

Better organisation and additional training is needed on bulk production, collective marketing,
negotiation skills etc. The role of marketing information can not be overemphasized. NASFAM will
increase its direct involvement in this area.

In an unpredictable market environment the introduction of post harvesting and processing technologies
is an essential intervention to add value to the produced commodities, to preserve the products for food
or future sells. The introduction of livestock in the system also minimise marketing risk allowing the
transformation of uneconomic commodities into profitable meat. NASFAM role is to link farmers to
buyers using several approached including "contract farming” or "contract marketing”.

Already effort has been made to form marketing committees at club, cluster and EPA levels. These are
charged with the responsibility of coordinating both output and input marketing at the different levels;
organizing produce for marketing, identification of buyers and negotiation of prices on behalf of their
members. These will require more training to equip them with the necessary skills which NASFAM will
continue to coordinate. In the first period the programme learnt that the provision of farm inputs2 led to

 

2 The long term nature of the programme’s objective entails long term solutions to challenges affecting livelihood
improvement. According to the baseline survey conducted in 2006, some of the crop production problems in Salima
and Mangochi included unreliable commodity markets, lack of farm input loans (inorganic fertilizers and improved
seed) and low adoption of improved varieties. In the first year the programme provided start up inputs in form of
improved seed and fertilizers. However, it can be appreciated that this is unsustainable both programmatically and
financially, there was risk of farmers viewing it as ‘handouts’ and on the other hand loan recoveries could
compromise extension work.

It is against this background that the programme sought to engage long term solutions one of which is contract
farming. This will bring along several advantages on both parties; notable ones to the farmers are ready organized
market (collective), pre—arranged/competitive commodity prices, access to farm inputs and improved negotiation
skills through their direct interface with the buyers. The programme will be relieved of time and financial resources
hence be able to effectively and efficiently discharge its extension duties, training and others in that line. Once this

43

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

programme staff being mistaken for debt collectors rather than development actors/facilitators. This,
with the exception of inputs for on farm tests and on farm demonstrations which are extension and
technology development tools, has been left out. Instead, with assistance from NASFAM, the
programme will facilitate the signing of contract growing between its beneficiaries and the respective
buyers.

NASFAM will therefore implement the following activities in the consortium:

Staff Capacity Building
It involves training of NASFAM staff in order to provide quality services to the farmers.

Development of training manuals
The first phase of the program implementation has seen trainings being offered to both
farmers and staff. However, adoption of the training has been slow at all levels. It is on this
note that we need to compliment the trainings with the presence of the manuals which
will act as reference points for both staff and farmers we well. Specifically, the manuals to
be developed include the following:

0 Business Development and Management Manual;
0 Collective marketing manual
0 Policy guidelines manual.

0 Policy and advocacy
Involves policy consultation with farmers and provide feedback

0 Strategic plan review and development
NASFAM strategic plan runs up to 2011 and there is needed to develop another whose
resources will be required.

0 Equipment support
A mean of transport which will assist to reduce mobility problems and to increase outreach as
well.

FUM

Farmers Union of Malawi is an apex body of farmer organisations in Malawi whose aim is to promote
and defend the interest of farmers through organizing farmers, capacity building, lobbying and advocacy
and information management and dissemination. FUM strives to build capacity of farmers monitoring
and evaluation of policies, strategies and programmes aimed at improving farmer livelihoods

Organisation Development continues to be the main stone for people’s mobilisation and empowerment.
Therefore, the success of government decentralisation programme will depend on the availability of well
prepared local leaders able to fully participate and influence the local government structures.

Farmers’ organisations are not widespread in rural Malawi. Those groups that do exist tend to be more
common in communities where the extension service has been active in mobilising farmers to form clubs
or developing income—generating activities, or where there has been external support. Whilst some may
operate effectively, many have a loose organisational structure, have poor leadership, limited business
capacity and do not function well. In general, a significant proportion of the community, including
women and the poorer members, do not belong to any groups.

 

concept is fully adopted, its implementation can continue beyond the life of the programme. Thus, the programme
will have achieved its objective in the aspect of farming as business.

44

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

The data base recently established in the country by the Consortium for the Development of Database
for Farmer Organisation (CoDeDaFO) to which FUM and NASFAM are members showed that only 22
organisations out of 2180 can be considered as sustainable. The challenges are financial constraints
resulting from farmer organisations’ low capital base and limited availability of credit institutions,
technical problems faced in the implementation of their activities, and a lack of capacity building.

Lessons from the first period

The livelihoods and empowerment focus of the Malawi Lake Basin Programme provides an important
framework in which the above issues are addressed. For instance, provision of befitting rural financial
services through Group Savings and Loans, Organisation Development and capacity building directly
address the challenging issues to farmer groups.

It would be concluded therefore that the process of establishing self—sufficient groups must be
systematic, should not be forced and must be done slowly. To expect immediate results is not realistic
before leadership is built. Short term success should be measured in terms of the development of social
relations and institutional strength. The programme will continue focusing on building the capacity of
people to develop innovative ways of learning and new forms of leadership. This approach will lead to
direct social and economic benefits as well as improvements in natural resources management.

Other important lesson from the first period is the fact that the collective performance of the group is
usually affected by few less committed and irresponsible individuals. Their attitudes undermine the
enthusiasm and dedication of the rest, in several cases causing the collapse of well established groups.
It is indeed necessary to reinforce organisation and leadership but it is also responsibility of the Unions
to influence the groups to clean their membership from pernicious elements.

The current experience also shows that a lot of effort, time and energy is wasted working with
retrogressive groups when there are others good groups which deserve attention. Everything calls for a
more selective attitude from the programme side. Non progressing groups will be dropped, effort will
concentrate on responsive groups and progressive individual farmers should also receive special
attention. These groups function as success stories and examples and role models of others can not be
underestimated.

FUM will therefore implement the following activities in the consortium:
0 Research, Policy Analysis and Advocacy

0 Policy Research
Lobbying and advocacy will be based on facts generated from research. The research is
therefore an integral part in building capacity of the organisations and farmers to
dialogue with government and other stakeholders on issues that affect them.

0 Capacity Building in Research, Policy and Advocacy
Capacity building forms an integral part of the program, therefore FUM will embark on
training of District Famers Union in policy, research, lobbying and advocacy so that they
raise issues at grass root level for policy dialogue with the District Assembly and at
national level.

0 Lobbying and advocacy

In order to promote greater participation of farmers in policy dialogue and
development of national plans, FUM will facilitate policy dialogue platforms or fora
where state and non state actors will be brought together to discuss issues affecting a
farmer and come up with possible solutions to contribute to the growth of the
agriculture sector and the economy, as a whole. This will include support to the Policy
Technical Working Group, a think tank for the Union on policy issues. The TWG

45

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

comprises of government, farmer organisations, civil society, and private sector who
will be analysing issues affecting farmers for lobbying and advocacy.

o OrganisationalDevelopment

0 Membership drive
For Farmers Union of Malawi to be strong and effective in defending the interest of
farmers and farmer organisations the union will have to increase its membership base

0 Farmer mobilisation and organisation development
FUM will build capacity of farmer organizations to put in place governance structures in
order to properly guide their operations. These structures include; Board of Trustees,
Executive board, and standing committees. Support to the farmer organization will be
in form of facilitating their meetings, trainings and facilitate transition from one
committee to the other.

0 Capacity building for FUM membership

Farmers Union of Malawi will depend facilitate capacity building for farmer
organizations to help them grow into sustainable business entities. The capacity
building initiatives will include; participatory capacity assessments, constitution
development and reviews, strategic planning, identification of fundraising opportunities
and financial management, improved business skills and linkage to stable and reliable
markets and loan facilities. FUM will also support the establishment of secretariats for
the farmer organisations to help them stand on their own without much external
assistance.

0 Information, Communication and Technology

0 Improve Information Management and Dissemination

Realising that information is crucial in development, Farmers Union of Malawi has the
role of facilitating sourcing, and managing and disseminating information to farmers to
enable them make appropriate decisions in their daily business.

FUM will facilitate use of appropriate channels like electronic, print, mass media for
disseminating and sharing of information so that the information reaches to the
intended audience.

FUM will also continue to bring Market information and other relevant information at
the farmers’ base through Information Centres in Malawi Lake Basin Program sites.
There is potential that these centres would benefit the farmers in the various
communities even more.

The general ignorance of farmers about their rights and obligations, the lack of
understanding about the negative effects of and the opportunities offered by the open
market, in addition to the need to expose them to new technologies and production
approaches make it necessary that a strong consolidation of the study circle
programme through establishment of Information Centres and other training methods
continue to function well during the coming period. FUM and MUSCCO are taking a
leading role in these activities.

0 Networking and Collaboration
For FUM to effectively develop its institution there is need to identify and work with other
partners in the agriculture sector. FUM will therefore identify and go into strategic alliances
with relevant stakeholders. This will assist FUM to amass numbers and support to influence

46

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

policy, tap from other stakeholders’ expertise and share resources for the benefit of the
farmer.

5.3.5 Strategy for Implementing Institutional Development

With the diverse nature of the expected outputs and indicators of success the implementation strategy
for this sub—programme objective, will need to take an innovative and diverse approach as well. The
strategy will draw for lessons form the previous phase as well as experiences elsewhere.

Lessons from the First period

The experience of the first period shows that people are not interested in organisations without a clear
economic or social objective confirming the importance of group formation behind an economic
enterprise. The model should be further developed and capitalised as an embryo for the formation of
commodity associations, unions, cooperatives and federations. At club level organisation development
represent the most serious and urgent issue to be addressed. The low level of organisation, the almost
complete ignorance about civil and political rights added to the lack of adequate leadership demand for
a more pro—active attitude from the programme not only to strengthen their organisation but also to
empower their members in decision making. Therefore training will continue being intensified. FUM has
assumed a greater responsibility in this.

The "hand out syndrome” added to the self proclamation of being "receivers" is jeopardising the best
effort of development. Therefore, more emphasis on organisation development is necessary. Self
mobilisation and political and civic education is a must if proper results are expected.

Collective marketing, business development and economic growth are fully dependant on the degree of
organisation. The formalisation of existing groups and the formation of "cluster producers associations”
affiliated to districts unions are planned for the next period. FUM must be provided with enough
resources to be able to increase its field presence and play a more active role in this area. A major lesson
for the period is the general attempt to replace traditional institutions with group organisation
development. The interaction with existing institutions is a prerequisite for organisation development.
Organisation development should not suffocate but make use of local institutions.

Strategy for the new phase

0 In order to develop or review the strategic plan for each of the national consortium members,
there will be need for workshops in each of the organizations to allow them to reflect on their
roles, objectives and priorities, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
from which reflection, they will revise their objective and come up with appropriate
implementation strategies

0 Implementation of their strategic plans will lead to achievement of the of the objective stated
thereof

0 As the national member of the consortium will be meeting to develop or revise their strategic
plans, it will be expected of them to build into such plans, activities of the MLBP. Similarly,
implementation of such strategic plans should naturally lead to the achievement of the MLBP
objectives. This is very crucial as it will provide a test as to whether MLBP activities will become
integral activities of the national members. Achievement of this will go a long way towards
ensuring long term sustainability of the programme.

0 The national consortium members will need to review the major policies, laws, norms, resource
allocation patterns etc with a view of identifying their strengths and weaknesses. This exercise
should lead into an engagement with appropriate stakeholders in the agricultural sector for
negotiating, lobbying and advocating for the interest of local communities. Lobbying and
advocacy will be an ongoing activity depending on the existing policies at any one point in time.

47

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

0 Just as the case was in the previous phase, mobilization of farmers into various farmer
organizations and associations using various participatory approaches including study circles will
be a continued activity in the programme. Using the techniques that have shown a lot of success
in the previous phase such as the study circles and the functional literacy programmes the
farmer groups should be trained and empowered to articulate their demands as well as to lobby
and advocate for their interests.

0 The national consortium members will have to come up with innovative ways of establishing
new sources of alternative funding for their organizations. Identification of funding is an activity
which will have to be integrated in their strategic plans and one of the major factors for
measuring success of their organizations will have to be this objective. Writing and presenting
proposals to donors is one temporally way of achieving the objective. There is need however to
come up with more sustainable ways such as membership fees, levies etc. Apparently the three
organizations are operating at different levels; in this regard some already have sustainable
ways of sourcing funds while others do not. It is possible to draw lessons from each other in this
regard.

5.3.6 Summary of activities under Institutional Development

Based on the afore—mentioned intervention areas for each local organization, a summary of the activities
proposed above is presented in Table 4 below:

6.0 PROGRAMME MONITORING AND EVALUATION

During the first period a Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation System (PME) was designed and tested.
Included in the PME System are the databases for farmer groups and households; geographical
information positioning system (GIS) maps for all participating groups; output indicators to measure
both efficiency and effectiveness of the programme in achieving its objectives. Input indicators include
trainings, provision of extension services and other agricultural materials, group exchange visits,
demonstrations, field days, workshops etc as elaborated in the plan of activities.

During the next period, the programme will aim at consolidating the PME system and facilitate frequent
monitoring activities focusing on the tendencies in Poverty Reduction, Nutrition and Food Security,
Business and Organisation Development, Cost—effective agricultural production, conservation and
sustainable use of Natural Resources and Adaptation to Climate Change.

The programme will continue guaranteeing participation by programme staff and beneficiaries to ensure
greater buy—in and active involvement in monitoring activities with feedback overtime for
improvements.

The activities for the period are included in the other components.

The means of monitoring will be through household surveys, GIS surveys, Focus Group Discussions and
profiling as well as internal monitoring and evaluation reports.

7. 0 PROGRAMME IMPLEMEN TA TION S TRA TE G Y

The past period of the Malawi’s Lake Basin Programme has, in general, confirmed the hypothesis,
general assumptions and proposed activities of the original Programme document. The programmatic
frame is well defined in that document. The development as well as operational objectives are indeed
valid and should continue ruling the Programme activities.

However, the gained experience as well as review and lessons learnt studies indicate the need to make
some adjustments in terms of activities, focus and expected outputs.

The original programme document represents a long term strategy including a broad number of
development issues, a huge number of activities and innumerable outputs unlikely to be achieved in a
short period of time. It is therefore necessary to focus the interventions on fewer but fundamental
development subjects. Because of the new development trends as well as the factual evidence of its
effect in Malawi, the new period will have a major focus on the mitigation of the negative effects of
climate change.

The important features of the implementation strategy for the Malawi Lake Basin Programme for the
coming period are listed below:

7.1 Capacity building

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme provides long—term commitment to sustainable rural livelihoods
development in Malawi focusing on building lasting capacities and results recognising the need for a
learning process—approach, where incentives to use information for learning purposes are built in.

The success of the programme will, in high degree, depend of the individual as well as the collective
competence of the staff. The holistic and interdisciplinary characteristic of the programme demand team
work and collective responsibility. The composition of the group, the different ages, technical
background and sex of the individual members must be transformed into capacity assets rather than
being a hindrance to collaboration. The concept of "team" goes beyond the programme own personnel.
They must be and feel part of a broader "development team” comprised of government and MBO
officials, NGOs personnel and the population themselves.

The weakness of the farmers groups, as well as the limited competence of programme and extension
staff in agri—business and other development skills shows need to invest time and resources in training.
The general ignorance of farmers about their rights and obligations, the lack of understanding about the
negative effects of and the opportunities offered by the open market, in addition to the need to expose
them to new technologies and production approaches make it necessary that a strong consolidation of
the study circle programme through establishment of Information Centres and other training methods
continue to function well during the coming period. FUM and MUSCCO are taking a leading role in these
activities.

As previously highlighted, the illiteracy level, especially among women, jeopardizes any effort done on
enlightening farmers about rights and opportunities. A special pilot women numeracy and literacy
programme has been outsourced from WOLREC in both districts, especially targeted to illiterate female

50

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

elected or potential leaders. Eventually the programme is meant to benefit the entire women population
on the programme.

Lessons from the First Period

The programme has invested a lot of resources into capacity building, especially at field level. Study
Circles are acquiring a massive appreciation among the targeted communities. Extension services
provided by the consortium and specific training in production, group dynamic, business development,
leadership, marketing etc is already showing its effect. However anything done in that area will never be
enough. Learning and acquisition of knowledge is a dynamic and permanent process. The adoption of
new concepts and practices are usually related to a change in people’s attitude which the experience
shows to be the most difficult obstacle to overcome.

Resources will be also specifically allocated to staff development. Programme employees as well as
collaborative government staff must be subject for competence improvement.

7.2 Establishment of Synergies and Networks

The globalisation and liberalisation of the economy, in addition to the high regional dependence existing
among countries around the Lake Malawi demands the establishment of local, national, regional and
international synergies.

The existing collaboration with local government departments must also develop to a more genuine
relationship. Collaboration with MBOs, NGOs and other development agencies must increase. Links
between and participation of Malawian farmers organisations with regional and international
organisations and networks must be promoted and supported. Individual farmers as well as local
farmers groups should continue to be exposed to regional experiences.

The Swedish Cooperative Centre continues providing added value to the Consortium. The long
experience in management of big development programmes, not only in Africa but Latin America,, Asia
and Europe provide a guaranty of excellence in the area of finance and administration both for a proper
handling of development funds but also to build capacity among consortium members and own local
personnel. Being the lead agency as well as the contract signatory, both with Sida and the Norwegian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SCC will continue playing an overall monitoring and control role over the
administration of the programme. However the top management positions will be progressively
occupied by African Nationals and it is expected that no later than 2011 SCC senior staff will assume
management and technical advisory positions rather than executive ones.

The fact that this programme mainly focuses into organisation and business development with emphasis
on the establishment of middle size commercial enterprises like commodity associations and
Cooperative development in the area of production and processing makes the participation of SCC in this
Consortium especially important. The presence of two regional offices in Africa added to its
international network and worldwide presence of SCC is also an important factor for the facilitation of
South—South, and South—North relations in the area of fund raising, organisation, lobby/advocacy, and
trade.

Civil Society support, Development of Financial Services, including insurance; and marketing in addition
to 50 year development experience in housing, producers and consumers’ cooperatives, rural

51

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

development and sustainable management of natural resources (agriculture and forestry) brings

additional and special value to SCC’s participation in the Consortium.

7.2.1 The MLBP as a catalyst of Livelihood Improvement

Programmes

The Malawi Lake Basin Programme also aims at creating synergies with other on—going Norwegian
supported projects such as the Chia Lagoon in Nkhotakota, the FAO project in Liwonde, in addition to

other existing synergies with Bunda
College of
Agriculture Research and Development

Agriculture and the

Programme (ARDEP), aiming at carrying
out demand—driven research and
improved extension services through
direct links with the districts. With its
long—term focus and comprehensive
approach to rural livelihood
development the Malawi Lake Basin
Programme provides a lasting link for a
rural livelihood oriented research
environment in Malawi. The issue of
adoption and/or

approaches and technology options

adaptation of

provided by the research would be
catered for through this collaboration.
The following map shows common
target areas in Salima and Mangochi
between the MLBP and TLC and FAQ

collaborations are evident

For that purpose a Coordinating Unit for
MLBP, TLC, FAO and ARDEP will be

and Business development.

Lessons from the First Period

Despite some difficulties for
collaboration with government
organizations, it appears that most
reliable partners in both districts are
government extension workers who
usually visit farmers when need arises

 

 

to provide their services. However, the
collaboration still poses a series of
challenges to make it more effective, and being the most important service providers; especially
agriculture extension personnel usually demand special allowances and other additional benefits to fulfil
their duties. Fisheries and forestry extensions are the most collaborative departments at district and
EPA level. Apart from these, in Khombedza EPA, some farmers are also working with MALEZA which is
addressing issues of household health and sanitation.

Collaboration with other organizations has been difficult to achieve at district level. We have learnt that
several organizations working in MLBP target areas are in principle unwilling to collaborate. Especially
among NGOs there is inbuilt mistrust as well as a defensive attitude due to hard competition to get
funds. It seems that "working isolated” give the organizations a higher profile fully capitalizing for the
results rather that sharing results with somebody else. The experience shows the need to establish both
personal as well as institutional links in terms of exchange of information, attendance to each others
meetings, field visits, social gathering etc before concrete join activities are proposed.

However, despite the initial difficulties several good examples of formal as well as non—formalized
partnerships are found both at national as well as at district level.

Participatory approaches will continue to be used regarding the involvement and coordination with on—
going programmes and projects in agriculture, fisheries and rural development at district, sub—district
and village levels both in the design and implementation of activities.

In a globalised world the issue of synergies and networking goes beyond national borders and must be
extended to the regional and international arena. South to South as well as North—South collaboration
among farmers’ organisations is essential. The possibility of interact should not be restricted to chief
executives and/or managers. This should be extended to farmers themselves.

53

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

7.3 Decentralisation and Local Capacity

Lessons from the First Period

The experience is showing that despite good intention there is still a long way to go before there is a
genuine power sharing between the Central and local government. The districts forum like the district
technical committees meet sporadically and their conclusions and recommendations are hardly followed
up.

Community structures like the Village Development Committee (VDC), Forestry Development Committee
(FDC), and Natural Resource Management Committee (NRMC) are mostly dying of inactivity. The lack of
resources is usually used as an excuse for their dormancy when in most cases the real reason appear to
be related to incapacity and general misunderstanding of their role. Often the local politicians also
undermine the possibility to fulfill their mandate, especially in relation to the FDC and the NRMC.

The role and authority of the traditional authorities is also dormant if not directly jeopardised by political
activism minimising the possibility to genuinely represent the interest of their people. This is the
political scenario of the areas in which the MLBP is working in.

The strategy adopted by the consortium to strengthen local power; working from the bottom, which is
enriched by grassroots’ generation and prioritization of issues that resides in study circle methodology,
seems to be the most adequate. This implies that more time and resources must be invested on local
empowerment. Through the strengthening of VDC and similar community based organisations in
addition to the establishment of close relation with traditional and District authorities, the possibility of
local influence in programmes like MLBP will increase.

7.4 Cross Cutting Issues

Being a Livelihood Improvement programme with special focus on business and marketing development,
the focus implies that several other important aspects became key factors which cross cut all the
activities, from planning up to evaluation and can not be treated as "specific" but as mainstreamed into
the programme.

7.4.1 Gender

There are far more women than men who are poor in Malawi. This is partly because it is traditionally the
women who cultivate food crops while men are cultivating cash crops (such as tobacco and paprika).
Women’s contribution and control over the outcome of their efforts is compromised by traditional
beliefs and cultural norms, which severely limit their access to education, credit, extension, inputs,
markets and health care services. Single mothers are the poorest and most vulnerable group in Malawi.
In spite of the fact that women carry out most of the work in the agriculture sector, they have less access
to land and crucial inputs than men do. Despite, HIV/AIDS affecting all members of the community,
women are more directly and indirectly affected by the epidemic. The burden of AIDS usually falls on the
shoulder of women; they are subjects of infection but still answer for household’s food production as
well as the social effect of the disease, taking care of sick husbands, orphans and elders. This further
reduces the labour of the household as it is women who are mostly involved in agricultural activities and
other domestic work.

The studies done so far are showing that despite an increasing participation of women in rural
development there is still an overwhelming majority of men in decision making positions. The same

54

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

picture is found in access to economic opportunities (benefit of marketing), distribution of household
incomes and access to social services like education and health. Among a generalised lack of education,
there is a rampant illiteracy among women which makes even more difficult their access to information,
training and leadership positions. The property of land granted to the wife by the dominant matrilineal
society is not enough to guarantee equity.

The MLBP, without excluding more general interventions relates gender, household and community
power relations to the equal access of women and men to economic opportunities, saving and loans
and marketing. The programme’s main focus will be on the removal of hindrances which prevent women
an equal access to those opportunities. The creation of new gender oriented business opportunities, as
well as the inclusion of elements which allow women to share control over its benefits are also central in
the programme.

An agreement with the "Women’s Legal Resource Centre” —WOLREC — aiming at joint activities to
protect women’s rights as well as to create conditions for political participation of women at village as
well as at District level has been carried out. Education and literacy campaigns using REFLECT are being
given first priority and will continue. A new agreement will be discussed with WOLREC for the new
period.

7.4.2 HIV/AIDS and Health

The role of nutrition, as a means of prevention as well as mitigation is usually underestimated in
HIV/AIDS campaigns. The programme is focusing mostly, but not exclusively, on mitigation actions based
on introduction of low energy—labour demanding technologies, high market and nutritional value
commodities like root and tubers, vegetables, small livestock, multipurpose and fruit trees as well as to
support social initiatives oriented to improve the service as well as the quality life of affected
communities.

The programme in this phase will further focus the work on HIV/AIDS and Health in the context of
business development and the possibilities and constraints those individuals and communities affected
have to go into productive activities which can generate income and develop more sustainable business
enterprises. The issue of availability/productivity of labour and work energy will be important factors to
deal with.

The MLBP has already established collaboration contacts with more specialised organisations to address
the global as well as the individual gender connotations of development as well as the social and
economic effects of HIV/AIDS. Concrete actions are undergoing in collaboration with NAC. The same is
being done with the Ministry of Gender in the two target Districts. There is an agreement expected to be
signed soon.

However, usually an even more vulnerable group is forgotten in the HIV/AIDS debate, namely the
children. They are mostly considered as passive victims rather than potential fighters. The establishment
of orphanages as well as formation of female groups taken care of them is commendable but an
HIV/AIDS strategy addressing children is necessary, not only as a subject for support but as a resource to
fight the spreading of the disease as well as an actor on mitigation measures. A more deeply intra and
infra—household gender analysis of the consequences of HIV/AIDS is necessary adjusting the
interventions to the findings. Supporting care of orphans and subsidising their school needs, like school
material and fees is not an issue of charity but of investment in human capital. The MLBP will continue
addressing the effect of HIV/AIDS in children by investing in their education and social welfare.

55

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

7.4.3 Human Rights and Democracy

As in the case of Gender and HIV/AIDS, the programme’s intervention in the area of human and civil
rights and democracy will not be restricted to the universal proclamation of the rights and to a more or
less tasteless democracy debate but to rights and power relations between producers and consumers, to
the preconditions of the free market and the lack of access to opportunities that non—organised and
oppressed small producers have to enjoy the benefits that a liberalised market offers. Political
mobilisation, social responsibility, leadership and governance are the key words.

Lessons from the First Period

The last study about social economic interdependence between agriculture and fisheries also shows that
female headed households are disadvantaged in all respects as compared to male headed households.
Therefore the programme places special emphasis on the connotation of gender inequalities and will
continue with special activities oriented not only to reduce gender disparities, but specifically targeting
women issues which make it difficult for their development possibilities. Special funds to subsidise initial
capital as well as the introduction of groups saving and loans are important tool to address economic
disparities, study circles will help to mobilise them and collaboration with other organisations address
the problem of illiteracy.

It has also been observed that the multiple roles and household responsibilities of women have serious
implications when planning activities. Because of spread food insecurity, women participation in
agriculture in the two districts is mainly allocated to planting, fertiliser application and harvesting of
maize and there is a permanent risk that any effort to reallocate labour to more productive activities will
be done as at the expense of critical tasks to family food security. The intensification of production
system in the target areas implies a careful analysis of the total labour availability getting insight of
reallocation possibilities, both in term of labour and tasks, based not only on agriculture activities but
also on the total household needs. The fact that a majority of men are also involved in fishing it increases
the work load and family responsibility of women. However, the overwhelming female participation in
market and business oriented enterprises, the introduced group saving and loan as well as the
opportunities that the programme is offering women to access decision making positions in the groups
will allow them to retain control over increased income generated by those activities. The principle of
"positive segregation” adopted by the programme seems well justified.

7.5 Close Monitoring of Activities

The complexity of the programme and the different kind of interventions and technologies under testing
demands a close monitoring of their performance and their effect both at household as well as at
community level. The programme is consolidating a simple but efficient PME system already established.
Monitoring also involves the implementation of studies and surveys to better understand the system
and the changes that the activities generate. Emphasis on data collection and processing of information
has characterised the last year of the lst phase of the programme. Before embarking in a new phase the
MLBP must have a clear understanding on the tendencies and trends originated during the first period to
ensure continuity as well as introduce correction elements

56

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

7.6' Geographical Concentration, Expansion and Regional
Vision

During the first period the MLBP has been directly acting in two districts and indirectly national wide
through the support provided to FUM and MUSCCO as well as important activities in the area of lobby,
policy, advocacy and information.

7.6.1 Cluster approach

The experience shows that scattered field activities are not cost effective. The Cluster approach adopted
in 2007/2008 will continue to guide the field activities. The use of Clusters facilitates extension services,
training, development planning and production, food processing and marketing. The Cluster will
consolidate as the basic development unit for the Malawi Lake Basin Programme.

A cluster is a geographical area consisting of several clubs grouped together for ease of collective
marketing, trainings and formation of producer association. Expansion of the programme coupled with
the need to form producer associations necessitated the shift of focus from a club to a cluster. Planning
is also easier with cluster approach. Consequently, club marketing committees form cluster marketing
committees which are in a better position to represent their subjects on issues related to the whole
production chain (production to marketing). So far it is proving to be the best way of working with
farmers and fisher folk in a more rational and systematic way.

7.6.2 EPA

The Extension Planning Area, as administrative Division of the Ministry of Agriculture is hosting the Field
Office and is considered as the nucleus of the programme in that area. Most networking and
collaboration with other stakeholders in the District happens at that level. The currents EPAs in
Mangochi and Salima will continue during the coming period. For seek of comparison and synergies
among farmers it has been advice to select and add at least one EPA in each of the two Districts in the
upland farfrom the lakeshore.

7.6.3 Districts

The positive experience accumulated in Salima and Mangochi as well as the regional vision of the
programme call for an eventual expansion of the activities. However, the programme needs to
consolidate in the current areas. The working methods, concept and approaches used during the first
period need to be properly tested and analyzed. The programme also needs to be politically
consolidated. That means to be integrated to the district development strategy as well as to develop
synergies and collaboration with other stakeholders. The creation of an enabling environment for the
presence and collaboration among FUM, NASFAM and MUSCCO in the areas of intervention also need to
be tested before expanding to other places. Therefore an eventual expansion to new areas should be
gradually and carefully considered according to the degree of consolidation in the current areas as well
as according to the implementation capacity of the programme. The availability of funds is indeed an
important element to consider before initiating any kind of expansion.

57

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

7.6.4 National

The action of the MLBP has gone beyond the initial plans for Salima and Mangochi Districts. With
support from the MLBP, FUM and MUSCCO have been able to strength and greatly increase their
national coverage. The participation of NASFAM, FUM, and MUSCCO in the Consortium, added to the
SCC networking in the region has implied a great and important nationwide role both in the area of
policy, lobby and advocacy but also in creating new spaces for dialog among the Civil Society
organisations and between the government and Farmers organisations. The programme is also having a
countrywide information system based on regular radio emissions and newspaper articles targeting the
farming community as well as middle class audience including politicians, international agencies
operating in Malawi and policy makers.

The already existing national coverage of the MLBP acquires a more coherent and systematic character
in the coming period.

7.6.5 Regional Vision

It is expected that the period will consolidate the regional vision of the programme through several
activities that will specifically be targeting the regionalization of the MLBP like:

0 The establishment of a regional coordination

0 Establishment of synergies with the Niassa programme in Mozambique as well as with the new
Vi—agro forestry project in Southern Tanzania

0 Workshops for regional planning

0 Definition of common approach to rural development and climate change adaptation

0 Cross borderjoint activities

0 Jointly lobbing and advocacy

58

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

8.0 PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT

The Organization and Management of the programmed will remain the same and which has the
Consortium Board, the Programme Secretariat, the Programme Technical Advisory Group and Field
Implementation Units.

8.1 Consortium Board (CB)

The Consortium Board is a non—executive body composed of one representative from each of the
organizations signatories. The Programme Director as an ex—officio member and the Secretary of the
Board.

The Board’s mandate shall remain to;

0 Contribute to the orientation of the programme

0 Provide advice in the programme implementation

0 Provide policy guidance

0 Approve annual work plans and budgets

0 Have a final say in programme strategic decisions

0 Approve the Director’s appointment/ re—appointment

8.2 The Programme Secretariat (PS)

The Programme Secretariat reflects the multi—disciplinary nature of the programme and is
administratively and programmatically accountable to the Chairman of the Board for day to day issues
and to the CB for strategy and policy issues.

Under the leadership of a Programme Director, the Programme Secretariat is responsible for managing,
supporting and coordinating the Programme activities.

A team of senior professionals combines formal technical qualifications with a thorough understanding
of rural development and poverty. The team guarantees competence in five critical areas of programme
implementation: facilitation, leadership and management, analytical skills, sector competence and
system competence and is composed by:

0 One Programme Director

0 One Financial and Administrative Officer

0 One Agriculture and Natural Resources Management Specialist
0 One Business and Organisational Development Specialist

0 Two PME Officers, and

0 Few administrative staff

0 One Assistant administration Officer

0 One Receptionist/Administrative Assistant

0 One driver/Office assistant

59

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

8.2.1 Meetings and Reporting

0 The Board will meet at least twice a year to review progress, approve budget and plans as well
as to discuss any other matter of its competence.

o The Management will yearly produce two quarterly reports (April and October), a Semi—annual
Report (July) and an Annual Report in February.

0 An external mid term Review will be carried out in October 2011 and an External Final
Evaluation in September 2013

o A yearly annual external audit will be carried out in January/February

8.2.2 Future options for management and operations

It is expected that the current programme staff shall gradually be absorbed by the national organizations
both at secretariat as well as field level. The management role and responsibility of the local
organisations within the consortium shall increase as that of the regional and international organisations
decrease as part of sustainability strategy. However the executive or advisory role of the international
members of the consortium, especially in the area of financial and administrative management can not
be overemphasized.

8.3 Programme Technical Advisory Group (PTAG)

The Programme Technical Advisory Group is comprised by Desk Officers from four consortium members
namely SCC, MUSCCO, NASFAM and FUM with the objective to follow up the programme activities, to
advise the Programme Director and to provide the necessary support to the management ensuring local
ownership, as well as full participation and coordination of their organisations in the implementation of
the programme. This group meets quarterly for routine monitoring and evaluation and monthly for
operational updates. The idea behind this group is not only monitoring and evaluation of activities but
even to assume specific responsibilities in the implementation of the programme. It is coordinated by
the Business and organization Development Specialist who also performs the responsibilities of Assistant
Director for the programme.

8.4 EPA Operational Units

At sub—district level (EPA), the Malawi Lake Basin Programme has established field co—ordination units
(field offices) that work in close co—operation with local farmer and fishermen organisations and make
use of the existing government structures and collaborate with other stakeholders operating in the same
area. The field co—ordination units drive the programme implementation. The presence of the Malawi
Lake Basin Programme in the sub—districts provides possibilities for collaboration with recently
decentralized structures of local government.

They are comprised by three experienced staff at Degree, Diploma and/or certificate level, including One
Business & Organisation Development Field Officer (BODO), one Natural Resources Management Field
Officer (NRMO), and a Field Extensionist (FE). One Office assistant takes care of the administration of the
field office.

One full time FUM staff is already fully integrated to one of the field offices to work exclusively with
mobilisation and group dynamic. At the end of this period it is foreseen than all field offices will have

60

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

not only a group development activist from FUM but a Financial Service field Officer from MUSCCO as
well as a Marketing Field Officer from NASFAM, all of them fully integrated to the team and working full
time in their respective areas of competence.

9.0 LOGFRAME

An LFA matrix of this programme proposal for all sub—programmes is presented in Annex 1. In the LFA,
there are specific sub—programme objective, expected outputs and activities. Specific indicators for each
sub—programme objective and the expected outputs are also elaborated in the matrix. The budgets for
the three sub—programmes shall also be presented differently. However, the overall programme
objective is the same for all the sub programmes.

10.0 FINANCIAL PROPOSAL AND BUDGET

The budget details for the programme are presented according to component in Annex II (See
attachment).

Increased financial resources for the coming period will depend in high degree from funds coming from
the current funding agencies. However the consortium must have a more proactive attitude toward
external funding.

The current proposal is based on the assumption that SCC will contribute with SEK 27,5 millions for the
full period (4,5 millions/year), and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs/RNE with NOK 40 millions
for the period (NOK 8 millions per year). The budget for the 5 year period is estimated in approximately
SEK 72,000,000.00 (Approximately NOK 60,000,000:OO)

Local members of the consortium; FUM, MUSCCO and NASFAM, will make in—kind contributions to the
programme; mainly through provision of technical assistance, facilities, field personnel and participation
in programme activities.

The average cost per household for the five—year period is very reasonable, a projection of around SEK
240. The benefits that will accrue to the target groups are plenty, and will continue to be useful in their
lives even beyond the life span of the programme. For instance, the knowledge that farmers and
fishermen will gain in improved technical production and organisational issues and the improved
systems for inputs and produce marketing would be useful for many seasons to come. The new
knowledge and skills will lead to increased productivity and enhanced household food security. The
budgeted amount should therefore be seen as an investment whose returns will continue to flow
beyond the five—year programme period.

11.0 RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGA TION

There are several risks that could undermine implementation of the programme and these are discussed
below. Mitigation strategies are proposed for some of the risks but for risks that are beyond the control
of programme management there is little that could be done to minimise them.

11.1 Economic Risks
While the programme appreciates Government of Malawi’s effort to ensure that farmers have access to
farm inputs through fertiliser and seed subsidy programme, MLBP registers fears that this might

61

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

jeopardise its effort to promote market oriented production. Through subsidy, real cost for inputs and
prices for other commodities tend to be hidden and farmers have a tendency of not making any effort to
progress with the fears that they would no longer be legible for subsidised inputs.

In Malawi, the Microfinance sector is still not fully developed as substantiated by the very low
percentage (1%) of rural people with access to microfinance services. This is a challenge to the
programme as it implies difficulties for farmers to access loans for the inputs and even if they access it,
the rates are high currently at about 23%.

The past experience within the programme shows that the GSL program is having good impact as it has
helped and continues to help developing saving, borrowing and investing culture among rural
communities which are a prerequisite for developing an efficient and effective microfinance sector. It is
envisaged that further promotion of this programme will lead to the establishment of SACCOs in the
impact areas.

Two steps are likely to be taken; linkage of GSLs to existing SACCO or bringing together of GSLs in a
particular district to establish a new SACCO.

The first approach which is likely to take place in Salima where FINCOOP an affiliate of MUSCCO operate
mobile banking services, will ensure that linked GSLs members and clubs become SACCO members at
the shortest time possible provided they attain the FINCOOP membership requirements. While in the
second approach which may take longer, will require that GSLs stop sharing out quickly and start
building capital for the envisaged SACCO.

With expansion of FINCOOP to all programme districts of operation, there is more likelihood of linkage
of GSLs to FINCOOP than formation of a new SACCO.

11.2 Environment and natural disasters (floods and droughts)

In line with the global focus outlined above, there is a risk that the gains made in the programme could
be reversed by natural disasters and or effects of climate change such as droughts and floods. The two
districts are prone to fluctuations in the weather patterns that could reverse progress made in the
project. Floods usually accelerate spread of diseases like malaria and cholera and these reduce labour
available and its productivity. Droughts impinge crop production hence reduced food production.

The past experience shows that the following would be remedies for the effects of climate change:

0 Promotion of drought and flood resistant crops and crop diversification.

0 Promotion of high yielding and disease resistant animal breeds.

0 Promotion of Agroforestry and afforestation programme

0 Empowering of community based natural resource management committees
0 Promotion of soil and water conservation, water harvesting technologies

0 Facilitate establishment of simple irrigation schemes

The rampant effects of HIV/AIDS are already being felt and are likely to worsen. The HIV/AIDS issue will
be addressed in all interventions supported and the main focus shall be on coping strategies and
mechanisms for mitigation of its effects.

62

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

11.3 Social and Political Risks

As indicated in our HIV and AIDS policy, the high prevalence (nationally at 12%) of HIV and AIDS and its
impact on the programme, partner organizations as well as households and communities that are
ultimate beneficiaries is reversing development gains and hindering achievement of the program me’s
goals of poverty alleviation. The pandemic has caused decimation of skilled and unskilled agricultural
labour causing steep reduction in agricultural production. The close association of HIV and AIDS and
poverty results in food and livelihood insecurity, impinging on the program me’s mandate of economic
empowerment for rural poor. With the deaths of adults, leaving behind a generation of young orphaned
children, the intergenerational transfer of knowledge and skills for sustainable use of natural resources
and sustainable farming techniques is reduced. This therefore calls for a proactive planning on the
program me’s side to take into account these impacts and ensure efficient mitigation measures are put
in place. The programme will have to partner with competent organizations in areas of HIV and AIDS to
increase its response to awareness, prevention measures and mitigation support to the affected and
infected households. The programme will:

0 Support partner organizations to establish effective HIV and AIDS workplace programme,
targeting its staff and members

0 Mainstream HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation in all sectors of interventions as well as
build capacity of partner organizations to mainstream HIV and AIDS

0 Strive to target women and girls for economic empowerment and hence reduce their
vulnerability resulting from economic needs

0 Together with partner organization ensure participation of the HIV and AIDS affected and
infected households in development work

Besides, the existing gender inequality between men and women in the impact areas is yet another risk
that would undermine the program me’s effort to empower women. Usually if not always, men have
access and control over economic resources as compared to women who may have access but little
control. Thus, Gender awareness, mainstreaming and empowerment of women to make decisions
become vital to reverse the trend.

It should be noted that another serious risk the programme is expected to continue experiencing is high
levels of illiteracy. This hampers the rate at which issues are understood and adopted. Usually, literacy
level determine even the rate of adoption of technologies: this has been difficult to achieve due to
illiteracy. Besides, there is strong tendency on business as usual whereby communities cling to the usual
methods to agricultural production. Adult literacy programme has been a tool for empowerment besides
reduce illiteracy and is proving to be a useful tool. But Malawians are in the phase of experiencing a
multiparty system and politicians take advantage of the people’s ignorance, which is a factor, multiplied
by poor literacy levels in the country. There is risk that politicians might parade the programme as their
own initiative and hence interfere during programme implementation.

Autonomy in making decisions about programme implementation at all levels has been explicit. In
addition, the selection criteria for service providers and beneficiary partners has always emphasised the
issue of non—party political affiliation. This will continue in the coming period.

11.4 Donor dependency and misconstrued community
expectations

Another risk is that, the areas of interventions have been infested with a donor—recipient mentality. This
jeopardizes development efforts as people tend to relax and choose not to work with expectations of
getting free resources in terms of farm inputs and food. The spirit also affects loan recovery both from
the programme side and locally in farmers groups. The programme therefore has to intensify trainings in
areas of micro—financing and community mobilization for favourable participation of members in
different development initiatives the programme may undertake.

63

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

There is a risk that the programme, which is fully externally funded, could further perpetuate the donor
dependency syndrome that is typical of most donor—funded programmes, particularly in Malawi. The risk
lies in encouraging the "helpless syndrome” where people feel they can do nothing for themselves and
wait for help from outside. There is also a risk that some target groups and their organisations may have
misconstrued perceptions about the programme and get the impression that another donor is coming
with “free” handouts.

To minimise these risks, the programme will put more emphasis during the initial awareness and
sensitisation meetings on explaining the objectives, expected outputs and the envisaged role and
contribution of the beneficiary organisations and their members. Pamphlets about the programme shall
be developed and disseminated in the programme area, including some in local languages. The
screening of potential beneficiary partners and projects should be done with the objective of "flushing—
out” opportunistic organisations and proposals and to this end, a number of organisational assessment
models have been suggested, see section under partnership. To foster ownership and enhance
sustainability from the onset, the issue of partner contribution will also be emphasised in all proposals
submitted for approval under this programme. This contribution could come in various forms and may
include own finances, material and human resources.

11.5 Poor infrastructure

Limited accessibility to some of the targeted areas is a potential risk to the success of the programme.
Communication links between the Malawi Programme Office in Lilongwe and the districts and EPA are
vital for success and effectiveness of the programme. Poor roads and telecommunications networks
make rural—urban communication very difficult. The lack of electricity in most parts of the two districts
will affect the choice and levels of labour saving technologies.

11.6' High staff turnover

This is a likely potential risk as experienced by most NGOs in the development sector. The high staff
turnover is usually high in well—qualified and experienced personnel. Loss of trained and competent
personnel slows down the pace of programme implementation and the extent to which targets are met.

11.7 Corruption

Malawi ranks 115 in Transparency International's new Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2008, which
ranks 180 nations based on domestic perceptions and expert assessments of public sector corruption.
Unfortunately there has been no significant success in the zero—tolerance corruption police and
corruption at all levels continues to be a mayor challenge as well as a concrete obstacle to sustainable
development. AID personnel as well as their beneficiaries are permanently exposed to corruption
practices, from simple procurement of stationary up to building contracts, consultancy services,
provision of subsidies, etc. Open and hidden corruption leaves little room for democracy development;
the rights of the people became a "merchandise to be bought/sold” and justice a parody. Due to the
amount of resources that the MLBP have and the activities we are involved in, it could easily fall in the
trap of corruption at Consortium member level, Secretariat, field personnel, partners and beneficiaries.

At operational level the MLBP has established a financial and administrative system which gives little
room for mismanagement and malpractices. The procurement, financial and physical assets control
strictly follows the rules and regulations established by the Swedish Cooperative Centre, Sida and Norad.
Physical control and monitoring of field Offices is regularly done. The financial monitoring allows
discovering attempt of fraud and corruption. SCC as lead agency has put in place a policy for preventing
fraud and corruption in its operations.

The institutional framework is also contaminated with the germen of corruption; everybody tries to get
"his/her share”. It is not strange that even at group or club level the leadership uses the position to

64

Malawi Lake Basin Proaramme Document 2009-2013

 

cheat the rest of the members and get personal gains. To prevent and minimise it, the MLBP intend to
strength processes of local governance to achieve greater transparency and accountability on a
sustainable basis. Efforts in this regard help to build the administrative, financial, and technical capacity
of local and traditional institutions so that they can effectively fulfil their role in overall efforts to
promote development and overcome poverty.

Equally important, strong local governance requires diversity of well—functioning community
organizations such as village development committees, farmers’ associations, youth groups, and savings
and credit cooperatives. —— In promoting strong community organizations, it is important to work with
traditional institutions in a non—exclusive manner, while still watching against elite capture of benefits.

12. 0 EXIT/TRANSFORMA TION S TRA TE G Y

As an exit/transformation strategy, the programme intends to have a more physical presence of the
national organizations in the field offices. As a starting point, the programme is already piloting in
Tembwe EPA with one field staff under FUM. It is expected that similar arrangements will be in place
with MUSCCO and NASFAM by the end of 2010. This will be a precursor to the national organizations’
take over of the programme’s field structure and activities but still with the latter’s support as the
programme moves to new areas. It is envisaged that this will consequently contribute to the
sustainability of the interventions as well as increase the outreach of the national organizations.
