1.0. PROJECT SUMMARY

Four years ago, the Episcopal Conference of Malawi, which is an Assembly of eight Diocesan
Bishops of the Catholic Dioceses of Blantyre, Chikhwawa, Dedza, Lilongwe, Mangochl, Mzuzu,
Zomba and Karonga, came up with a Strategy for the period 2000 to 2011. This was with
assistance from funding partners CRS, CAFOD, Trocaire, lVllSSlC) Aachen andl Cordaicl to the tune
of MK7,712,168.75 (approximately, Euro 64,000 at the 2003 rate of exchange of Euro 1 =

MKlZO)

The main purpose of this Strategic Plan was to assist ECM to redefine its key functions, roles
and responsibilities in the light of the perceived conflict of roles between the ECM national
offices (the Catholic Secretariat). In this regard, the Strategic: Plan was meant: to assist ECIVi in
refocusing its operations and activities and create clear linkages with the Dioceses and clear
linkages between diocesan structures and grassroots communities. The Strategic Plan also
endeavored to take into consideration the relevant emerging trends in EClVi's operating
environment. Consequently, the Strategic Plan provided the Conference with a timely
opportunity to enhance its overall performance and at the same time consolidate stakeholder
involvement and confidence in ECl\/|’s resource mobilization and utilization.

Four years have elapsed since the launch of this Strategic: Plan and several activities have been
implemented based on this Strategic Plan. Notable ones include the establishment of the
Catholic Health Commission and renaming of positions in EClVl from Directors to Secretaries. in
addition to this, four commissions (CADECOM, Health, CCJP and Education) have developed
their own Strategic Plans based on this master plan. At programming level, several justice and
peace (governance), health and developmental related programs have been developed based
on the aspirations of this plan.

Since ECM is operating and responding to issues occurring in a dynamic environment where
situations are always changing, it has become imperative that we review this Strategic Plan and
determine whether there has been progress in implementing this Plan or not and redirect: our
efforts and strategies accordingly. ECM is therefore seeking to develop a new strategic plan to
cover the years from 2011 to 2016.

To this end ECM is seeking financial support from its cooperating partners amounting to Mite,

434,000.00. ECM has made its own financial contribution to the strategic plan process as seen
from the budget lines in the project budget marked with no actual costs.

2.0. PROBLEM STATEMENT"

Implementation of the 2006-2011 Strategic Plan has demonstrated that some important
strategic issues on development were left out in line with the changes in social-economic and
political environment and the plan did not provide clear and comprehensive direction on some
of the strategic issues. This anomaly has caused a lot of problems not only for the Church, but
also on the part of its donor partners with interest in such development: issues.

The Strategic Plan was developed with less emphasis on integrated approach and without a
proper accompanying budget. As such implementation of strategic issues has been based on
individual initiatives either from the individual commissions or dioceses and the national office.
In some instances some programming has been done without direct reference to the master
plan. Similarly, few dioceses have developed their strategic: plans, and those that have, there is
little indication that they used the ECM master strategic plan as a reference point.

It has also been noted that the consultative process left out an important: stakeholder, the
communities that we work with. These communities were not adequately consulted and
therefore do not own the Strategic Plan. This has resulted in some critical issues being left out.
Since its launch, there has not been any meeting to review or report on the progress of
implementation of this plan and ECM is not aware of the exact progress it has achieved in
implementing this plan.

There have also been significant changes over the last five years in the socioeconomic, andl
pastoral context in which the Church in Malawi is operating. Such changes: include:

o a new interest in financial linkages after the international credit crunch;

- a new emphasis on climate change and disaster risk reduction interventions;

0 new developments in the fight against HIV/AEDS: studies on male circumcision; studies
indicating the spread of HIV within ’stable’ families in Malawi;

0 new and demonstrated emphasis on the linkage between population growth, poverty
and development,-

0 new challenges on the credibility of the leadership of the Church and calls for the
Church to walk the talk in all development and pastoral matters

0 The desire for the church in Malawi to become intrusive and proactive to governance
and peace building processes other than becoming reactive.

Operating in this new environment and conscious of her role in the integral development of
people in Malawi, it has become imperative that a new and dynamic strategic plan he
developed for the next five years.

 

 

Based on the noted problems above and the desire to move with the changing environment.
ECM has decided to review the existing plan and develop a plan for the next five years (20211»
2016). This need for the review was also already highlighted by the Chairman of the Conference

who indicated that:

"The Strategic Plan is flexible in that it is ready to incorporate any important dictates of'both the
internal and external environments. This flexibility will also be readily reflected in the
institutional framework Wherever and whenever necessary. ECM management will therefore be
delighted to receive meaningful and constructive suggestions and contributions on how the
conference could improve its service delivery” (Foreword in ECM Strategic: Plan by His Grace

Archbishop T.G. Ziyaye)

in this case, the Catholic Church in Malawi shall become responsive and relevant to the needs;
and aspirations of the people it reaches out to.

3.0. MAJOR OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT

3.1. Outcome result 1: Institutional Audit for the Catholic Church in Malawi report produced

An institutional audit exercise shall be done to gain a deeper understanding of the existence,
functionality and relevancy of the structures established by ECM towards the realization of
ECM’s mandate. It is an overarching analysis of the existing and functionality of ECM
established structures from grassroots parishes to dioceses up to the national secretariat.
Through this analysis, it is expected that the relevancy, efficacy, functionality and existence of
ECM structures, values, guiding principles and programs will be understood. The results of the
audit will be important in influencing the review processes of the existing SP and in identifying
better, effective and new strategies for institutional, structural as well as policy response to the
thematic issues identified from the living socioeconomic and political context: of" Malawi.

it is also proposed that dioceses and some diocesan structures1 shall participate in this audit
exercise through their responses to questionnaires designed by the MEtlE unit of ECM, which is
part and parcel of the Technical Working Group on ECM strategic plan? The findings from

diocesan questionnaires shall be put together into a final ECM institutional audit report that

 

1 . . . . .
7 Other diocesan structures Include catechctical centers, pastoral centers, semmanes and women groups.

Due to limited resources, It IS not possible for the diocesan structures to hold consultation meetian with
communitles but it IS understood that by working closer to communities, dioceses are. in touch with the dynamic
reality on the ground. '

shall be compiled by the identified consultant for the strategic planning process. This shall be

made ready before any review processes for the preceding Strategic plan start.

3.2. Outcome result 2: ECM Strategic Plan for 2011 to 201.6 developed

The following activities below explain how this outcome no 2. is going to be realized:

The strategic plan development process shall include taking insights from the institutional audit:
report,3 reviewing the preceding strategic plan to assess its weaknesses and strengths,
prioritization meeting which shall be organized to flush out new thematic areas, structural,
policy and organizational responses into a 2011- 2016 strategic plan.

Three regional meetings4 shall be organized and facilitated by the identified consultant,
backstopped by representatives of the Technical Working Group so that the eight dioceses are
split into three groups to go through the institutional audit findings and recommendations,
review of the preceding strategic plan and finally go through the issues identified from the
analysis of the current socio—economic and political context.

This whole process shall end up in a prioritization workshop conducted nationally bringing
together representatives from the eight dioceses and the national secretariat. The draft:
skeleton strategic plan with the operation plan and M&E work plan shall be put in place for
finalization by the consultant.

Prior to strategic plan vetting process by ECM structures, the consultant: shall bounce off the
strategic areas with cooperating partnersS since they are also important stakeholders in the
realization of integral human development for Malawians,

Furthermore, the draft strategic plan shall be vetted by representatives from all the eight:
dioceses including the national secretariat“. This will allow for confirmation on the issues or
thematic areas and strategies identified for the new SP.

The vetted strategic plan shall be presented to the Episcopal Conference of Malawi so that: the
Bishops can endorse it before it is officially published, launched and disseminated for
implementation.

 

3 At this stage already completed and ﬁnalized.

4 20 representatives from dioceses in southern, central and northern shall be brought. together for these meetings.
These representatives shall cover all the established diocesan structures relevant for the SP proc“ '.

5 By cooperating partners, we mean those we collaborate with in program delivery like other faith based institutions
but also our donor partners that materially and ﬁnancially support us to execute our programs.

6 We cannot continue to vet the second draft strategic plan in regions due to lack of adequate, however, we need to
bring together diocesan representatives and national secretariat representatives for a national ﬁnal vetting process.

The launch of the 2011 to 2016 strategic plan will be done at the end of everything so that the
document which is master plan for the Catholic Church in [Malawi  popularized to many
stakeholders implied in the effective implementation and realization of the new strategic: areas.

3.3. Outcome result 3: improved implementation of the Strategic Plan

One critical challenge identified with the preceding Strategic plan was lack of the monitoring
and evaluation framework including resource mobilization strategy. it is envisaged that, by the
end of the strategic plan developing process, some selected members of the Technical Working
Group shall be put into a new team7 to oversee, together with the office of the Secretary
General, the resource mobilization activities, the implementation and monitoring and
evaluation processes in the schedule of annual reviews, midterm review and end of SP review
and evaluation. Assessment of compliance to the identified thematic areas of the overarching
strategic plan shall be under this team. in turn it is expected that ECM shall have improved its
coordination and implementation strategy.

 

4.0. PROJECT STRATEGY

 

To provide better services through the dioceses and to the communities and rectify problems
as highlighted above, The Episcopal Conference of Malawi proposes a twelve months project
with the following objectives to review the preceding strategic plan and come up with a new

To achieve the above objectives; EClVi proposes to conduct this process in three phases as
below. These processes and steps have been designed to respond effectively to the planning
and developing as well as implementation processes of the SP.

4.2. PHASE l— PREPARATORY WORK

Preparatory activities under phase one will include the following:

4.2.1. Appointment of an internal Technical Working Group (TWG)

An internal Technical Working Group8 will be appointed by the Catholic Secretariat and
mandated to take a leading role in facilitating review of the existing plan with the dioceses and
other key stakeholders. This is a smaller body that: is composed of technical people in the
project programming, resource mobilization and l\/l&E perspectives. This team shall also
backstop the identiﬁed consultant in the strategic plan development process.

This Team will among other things be involved in the following:

4.2.2. Development of Terms of Reference

in liaison with the Secretary General, the Technical Working Group will develop Terms of
Reference to define the scope of work for all related processes and key stages and roles
towards the production of a new strategic plan for ECM. Furthermore, it shall backstop the core

activities earmarked for the consultant, who is an independent person from EClVi within the
strategic plan production processes.9

4.2.3. Planning and conducting institutional audit for ECM

The Technical Working Group using the expertise from the l\/|&E will come up with data
collection tools that will be used to collect information for the ECM Institutional Audit. This
information will be analyzed and will be an important input into the review process of the
Strategic Plan. The audit exercise shall be done in two phases, one for the national offices and
using questionnaires for all the 8m dioceses10 as detailed below.

 

8 This group is composed already of the heads of programming in the Commissions ofthe Catl'ioli Secretariat. tl'ie
M&E section as well as the ofﬁce ofthe Secretary General. It has the overall responsibility of overseeing and
backstopping the strategic plan review, analysis and final development processes. Due to resrtiurces and to limit
transport costs, two representatives from Lilongwe Diocese one from programmin and another from pastoral
commission are members of TWG.
LP or details of the TORS of the  please refer to the attached appendices.

Due to the limitation offunds, it is not possible to hold institutional audit exercise in a form ofa workshop for all
eight dioceses; instead a research approach seeking to acquire qualitative data from the dioceses shall be used. This
shall be synthesized together with the audit results from the national ofﬁces.

4.2.3.1. Facilitation of an institutional audit for the Catholic Secretariat staff

Using the tools developed under (ii), the TWG will organize a three day workshop for the
Catholic Secretariat staff to conduct an institutional audit on systems... governance
structure and procedures that has inﬂuenced the implementation ofthe Strategic Plan.

4.2.3.1. Facilitation of an institutional audit for all the Dioceses

This exercise will involve all the Dioceses. The Dioceses will be given institutional audit
questionnaires that they will fill. The questionnaires will be collected and analyzed to
provide a picture of their institutions.

4.3. PHASE II - GROUND WORK AND ACTUAL STRATEGIC PLAN ANALYSIS

Activities under this phase will include the following:
4.3.1. Recruitment of a Consultant

The Technical Working Group will come up with Terms of Reference to recruit a

competent Consultant who will take us through the rest of the process in developing
our Strategic Plan.

Notable activities will include the following:
4.3.2. Hold consultative meetings

The Consultant together with the TWG will hold consultative meetings with all the relevant
stakeholders mainly the Diocesan authorities, Staff and our stakeholders. The consultant will
engage through regional meetings and selected key interviews, all the eight dioceses and the

Catholic Secretariat. In addition to this, there will be face to face meetings with our cooperating
stakeholders.

4.3.3. Hold a meeting to prioritize issues

The Consultant will be expected to facilitate a meeting to prioritize issues identified during the
consultative meeting and the institutional audits. This meeting will come up with issues that will.
eventually inform the final Strategic Plan.

4.3.4. Organize a validation workshop

Once the consultative process is over and the issues are prioritized, the consultant will have to
produce a draft reviewed Strategic Plan document that will be presented during a validation
workshop. It is at this workshop where participants are going to perfect the document and edit
accordingly based on the draft and their needs.

electronic and hard copy version.

4.4. PHASE III PLANNING FOR RESOURCE MOBILIZATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND
MONITORING AND EVALUATION

This phase will ensure that the SP is implemented to its end

The TWG will take a leading role in this process and activities will include the following:

4.4.1. Production of an Operational Plan for the Strategy

This Strategic Plan can only be implemented if there is an Operational Plan. This will be
produced to give direction on what should be done first and also to determine responsibility for
such activities.

4.4.2. Production of a budget

To implement the Operational Plan, a budget will be produced that will fund strategies
indicated in the plan.

4.4.3. Establishment of a team to oversee implementation of this plan
