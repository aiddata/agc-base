PRO/BOO/RC 25 November 2010

Dear Vincent,

Subject: Co-Financing Agreement between irish Aid and the United Nations
Development Programme Malawi in support of the UN Transformation Fund,
11 June 2008
Request for Irish Aid contribution to UN Transformation Programme { through
the UN Transformation Fund)

As stipulated in the above mentioned co-financing agreement, i am very pleased to report
you on the progress of the ’Delivering as One’ (030) in Maiawi. The financial report of the
irish Aid contribution of Euro 210,000 in 2008 and 2009 is attached to this letter.

The past two years (2009/2010) brought major achievements in the UN work in Malawi.
These accomplishments were supported by the Government leadership, a committed UNCT,
and a supportive donor community. Enhanced ownership by the Government was translated
into the co—chairmanship of the Joint Strategy Meeting, the close involvement in key
decisions concerning the One Plan alignment with national strategies and the funding
allocation from the One UN Fund and the successful undertaking of the DaO Countryeled
Evaluation. Together with Vietnam, the Government of Malawi brought to the High—level
Conference the completed Country~led Evaluation report, contributing to experiences
sharing and lessons learnt which had an impact on the final Statement of the Conference.

The DaO concept has been gradually internalized through increased collaboration and new
business practices among UN agencies. There is marked shift from an agency~based focus
to an issue focus in the common advocacy area. Key policy areas such as maternal
mortality, HIV prevention, women empowerment have yielded results that individual
agencies would not have been able to achieve alone.

Predictable funding to the One Plan has been increased with the allocation from the
Expanded Window Fund of USD 18.51 million in 2009 and USD 9,448 million in 2010. The
additional fund is valuable as it is clearly a sign of global recognition of the progress made in
DaO in Malawi. But more importantly the fund enables the Government and the UN to
upscale and prioritize interventions for development results as set out in the One Plan.

The 2010 annual retreat culminated with all UNCT members signing the shared vision:
'Vision 2016 - UN Agencies working coherently and effectively to support the government
and people of Malawi to achieve prosperity, human rights and wellbeing’.

In the last two years the UN Country Team devoted considerable time to laying the
foundations for a new way of working. By the end of 2009, essential systems and
mechanisms to support the DaO such as the One Plan, One UN Fund, Resource
Mobilization Strategy, Humanitarian Reform, Aid Effectiveness, Capacity Development
and Common Services have been established. Having laid the ground work to deliver as
one, the UN was able to devote full attention to implementation of the One Plan in 2010
and intensify the reform efforts in other transformation areas.

2010 also saw the finalisation of the UN Malawi Transformation Plan. Being a logical
successor to the UN Business Plan 2008/2009, the Transformation Plan builds on the gains
in DaO made in Malawi since the start of the first UNDAF (2008—2011}. The new
Transformation Plan covers the period of 2010 — 2011 and as such will support the process
of UNDAF formulation, One Plan/One Budget formulation and all associated change
management initiatives required to effectively align to the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy. The Transformation Plan further has two specific strong focus areas,
notable;

(1) Benchmarking progress in DaO, improving cohesion, coherence and relevance of UN
programmes. This will not only enable improved substantive management of the
process, but also will allow for greater accountability of the UNCT to Government,
Development Partners and C305 on progress; and

(2) Benchmarking improved operational efficiency in order to ensure that investment
made in business and process rationalization can be measured in hard operational
gains that can lead to actual savings that can be deployed to other purposes.

A key success factor in delivering UN reform in Malawi is the role of the development
partners. There was continued interest and engagement from the transformation donor
group which has been supporting the achievement of the reform objectives both politically and
financially.

On behalf of the UN Country Team I look forward to your consideration to continue support
the UN Malawi financially in 2010/2011 through the UN Transformation lFund.

Yours sincerely,
W
