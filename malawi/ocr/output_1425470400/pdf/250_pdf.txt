Moan Dairy Farmers Association

 

EXECUTlVE SUMMARY

Dairy production in Malawi shows great promise as a way to lift large numbers Of People OUt 0f
poverty, as an important means of generating income and to support a healthy diet through the
consumption of dairy products. However production is very low in relation to the total popuiation.
Milk production takes place mainly at small holder farms, with most of :ne miiik groomed in the

southern region.

Prices of dairy products in Malawi are very high in comparison to other countries in sub Saharan

Africa which result in a situation whereby only an estimated 10-15% of the population can afford to
buy dairy products. Over 50% of the current consumption is being imported which indicate a wide
open market for producers. Increased production wil! give more people access to dairy products.

The production of milk is especially low in the central and northern regions ofthe country caused by

the following factors;
0 Low number of cows.

. Low production per cow

0 Lack of technical and marketing support services for the small holders

0 Lack of capacity of the dairy Associations.

0 Lack of competition among the processors.

0 Lack of breeding services to increase the cow numbers and genetic progress

0 Lack of government support for the sector
This program proposes to address these problems in the mentioned regions through funding of the
following activities.

1. Build capacity of the Regional and National Dairy Associations by tra

hired]
2. Increase of service delivery to the Milk B
3. Hands on training for farmers at the new instituted Practical Training School.

4. Increase cow numbers through management support for the farmers and the
technical training, administrative support and low cost innovative projects
5. Develop a "dairy lobby” at the national level, to give the industry a voice with the

ining of staff [to be

ulking GroupslMBG’s] and the small holder famers

MBG’s,

government and other Industry players.
The implementing partners for the program are the Malawi Milk Producers Association and the two

regional Associations.

4.2 Implementing partners of the program

The Association; [regional and national]

____———————

They will be responsible for creating the environment conducive for dairy farming and dairy farmers.

MBG’s and the farmers, training of staff and farmers,
and lobby on behalf of the
h PR actions for the

They have to increase service delivery to the
disseminate information, develop markets, [formal and informal]
farmers. They also have an important part to play in growing the market throug
general public

CREMPA has registered 70 MBG’s [or dairy groups] with a total membership of over 7000. At the

moment only 13 are able to provide cooling facilities and are active in milk marketing.
in MDFA there are 35 MBG’s registered with the association with a total of 3000 members. At the

moment only 9 are active in selling milk to processors. The regional associations have offices with a

minimum of administrative staff and one VSO-experts each.
The umbrella [MMPA] has been supplied with 2 volunteers through VSO Malawi, to take up the

\lational representation of all members.

(atete Fa rm

(atete Farm is a large commercial Dairy farm with 240 dairy animals, owned by a Malawian business
nan, who has a vision of supporting small holders. As stated above the preparation and training of
new] dairy farmers for their complicated task to manage a dairy cow and the business side of being

i ialmCT are almost none existent. This activity will prepare farmers much better for the task

 

 

 

[i

then any classroom training could accomplish as they will be submersed in the daily activities of a
farm. The owner of Katete has agreed to facilitate a practical training centre on his premises. This
will create an opportunity for new and existing farmers to get hands on training in two week training
course, something that was never before available to farmers. Because of the size ofthis farm,
farmers will get to work and see all activities and problems one can face as an owner of a cow. In
order to simulate the village setting, 4 regular one cow khola's [cattle barn] will be build for the
training. The farm is providing the infrastructure for the school and has made one trainer available
to the program. It is being set up in a way that 10 farmers at the time can come for two week
training, which include all facets of daily farm activities in a village setting and in a commercial way.
The farm also has a small processing facility Fees will be charged for students, but overall the
schools activities will be "income neutral”. MMPA will supply the training with the help from a VSO
volunteer to train the trainers. An M.o.U between MMPA and the Farm owner will be signed soon.
in subsequent years 100 students annually will be supported by this program. When the school is in
full operation it is expected to be able to train 200 small holder farmers per annum. Other NGO’s
and Government have expressed interest sending students which will make this activity sustainable
in the nearfuture. If successful this can be replicated in the northern region, as numbers increase.

Volunteer Services Overseas [V50]

V50 has supported the Dairy Associations with technical and business advisors for a number of years
Presently VSO has 5 volunteers in place under their Business and Market Development Program.
Two business advisors in CREMPA and MDFA, one dairy training and gender specialist at MMPA, one
Association coordinator/dairy specialist at MMPA and one experienced Veterinarian in SHIMPA.

MDFA shares a volunteer veterinarian with Mzuzu ADD, supported by World Universities of
Canada.

The roll of VSO volunteers is mainly to help build capacity in the above mentioned areas. An
important consideration will be the advisory and training role to prepare the [to be appointed} staff
for this program, and training counter parts to secure sustainability towards the end of the project
time frame. VSO has secured funding till 2013 to undertake market development and business
training activities with the associations, through placing of volunteers in strategic places within the
industry. After this time frame they will evaluate the situation and determine what other [if any]
areas need to be looked at.

4.3 Other contributing stakeholders in the program

Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security - Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development
MoAFS and DAHLD play an important role in monitoring and evaluation as well information
dissimination. At the regional level officials from the ADD’s take part in the discussions with the
dairy Associations.

MoAFS can also play a major role in the regulatory issues and international market developments
that are affecting the industry [hence the 30% import levy on milk and milk powder that was

recently imposed to protect the local farmers]

MoAFS, under its extension training program with FICA, can supply [re]trained extension workers to
the program to enhance the services to the farmers.

[Z

DAHLD can provide veterinarian [Para— vets] officers and assistants to support the local farmers and
trained AI technicians to take on Al services.[Link with FICA program at Mikolongwe Veterinarian

College]

Small Scale Livestock Production Program |SSLPP|

SSLPP is already an implementing Partner in the FICA intervention in Kasungu and Mzimba districts
which are part of the target area. This program will be able to link up with the training activities in
these areas.

The Commission ofthe European Union lEU

in a recent development the EU has put out a tender for 2 liquid nitrogen Machines for Malawi, to
address the shortage of LN2 for breeding services across the country. This plays well with this [FICA]
intervention as it was also part ofthe original 'Identification nota’. Now this program can
concentrate more on the distribution of LN2 and semen, as that part was not addressed by the EU
and is of similar importance to improve breeding services for the small holders

Other NGO's with dairy development programs

Several NGOs (Land O Lakes, Heifer International, World Vision, Japanese international Cooperation
Agency, World Universities of Canada) are working on dairy development or have a dairy
component. Regularly they supply infra structure for MBG’s and/ or supply cows to new farmers.
They will be given the opportunity to send new farmers to the Practical Training Center

Civil Societv Agriculture Network (CISAN ET)

As a civil society group CISANET is lobbying for increased support for pro-poor agricultural growth,
emphasizing the shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming. Currently CISANET is
involved in a review of Malawi Dairy Policies. CISANET is aiming for an update of the Regulatory
Framework of the Dairy Industry and the establishment of a Dairy Industry Promotion Council. These
efforts will strongly support the work of the Milk Producers Association. For more details see

5 PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK (see Annex 2 for Logical Framework)

5.1 General objective

The general objective to which the program wants to contribute is strengthening of the Dairy sector
in the central and northern region of Malawi.

5.2 Program objectives

Developmental program objective:
Increasing in service delivery and technical support at CREMPA, MDFA, MMPA.

Institutional program objective:
Strengthening and capacity building of CREMPA, MDFA, MMPA

5.3 Results and activities

Result 1: Capacity building and training of farmers and MBG’s

This result area directly targets the small holders and milkbulking groups, in order to overcome the
problems related to low milk production at farm level and lack of knowledge on dairy animal
management. it involves the practical training of new and existing farmers at Katete Practical
Training Centre and training in marketing, hygiene and quality control. It is linked to the
development of lead farmers (= link with FICA-extension program ). Depending on the rate of
implementation and success ofthe program in the first two years, a second Practical Training Centre
may be set up in the north, during the second half of implementation.

Result 2: Capacity of associations strengthened

On the institutional side this is the most important result the program is aiming at. It entails training
and capacity building of board, managers and technical staff of the associations in order to improve
the management and long term sustainability of the assooations. Training topics are cooperative
structures, general and financial management, marketing and data base development etc.

in addition it aims at improved marketing, promotion, information sharing; lobbying and providing
a voice for the industry in the country to deal with government and large scale processors. Also
improved coordination of services and training (incl. from other service providers like the NGOs) to
MBG’s and farmers; Developing standardization models for Al and service fees across the target
area; Linking with FICA extension Training program.

Result 3: Enhancement of technical service delivery

An important function of the regional associations is service delivery to their members such as
semen and liquid nitrogen provision, delivery of animal health products, advise on dairy mash and
khola design, small scale value adding, (breeding) information supply through data base
development, etc. Seed money provided through the program will facilitate the bulk buying of
inputs by the regional associations, which then can be sold with a small profit to the members (but
still at much lower prices than an individual farmer would be able to access). In this way the system
strives to sustain itself over the course of time (cfr. Experiences SHIMPA). Professional and reliable
service delivery will stimulate membership of the farmers which will lead to higher income for the
associations through more membership fees. It will also enhance the shift from informal to formal

r

[4

A number of pilot projects will be set up targeting Small scale cooperative value adding.

Result 4: Increase of cow numbers through increased herd management

This result area aims at improving the total number of cows through better management and
coordination of the numerous ad hoc activities presently going on, often with limited sustainability
results on the longer term. It aims at improving the pass-on system; institute heifer loan scheme
and animal identification, improved breeding, coordination of activities, improving recording/
tracking systems, Development of a comprehensive identiﬁcation system, etc.

All of the Associations are governed by a constitution. Most of the M86 have similar constitutions
based on the constitution from the umbrella.

6.2 Management and implementation

On September 17, 2009 a stakeholder work shop was organized. The outcomes of this meeting for
the different areas of the program are incorporated in this proposal.

MMPA will be the implementing partner of this program. They will have an overall manager, the
lead accountant and the Association Coordinator [VSO Volunteer] on their staff. They also have a
duly elected board representing all 3 associations to guide them through the process

The regional associations will, in cooperation with MMPA and with the advice from the respective
Boards, Managers and {VSO} Business advisors, implement the programs and activities for the
Associations as directed underthe mandate ofthis program.

The lead accountant will ensure proper management of the finances at MMPA and the regional
associations through monitoring and evaluation on a quarterly basis, and is responsible for
developing proper accounting systems and training of accounting personnel at the regional
associations

He/she will also be available for auditing services to the MBG’s as per request.

 

Ab

Provisions have been made in the budget, for input in the program and its implementation, for all
the members ofthe Associations through financial support of annual general meetings [AGM]

0n the regional level there are provisions for dialog with the MBG’s through financial support of
meetings with all chair people of MBG’s in addition to the AGM, to monitor progress of the program
FICA will put its own M and E program forward.

A special bank account will be opened for this program

6.3 Staff

This intervention is geared towards "separation of powers“ at the association level in providing a
managerfor MDFA and a combined Manager for CREMPA and MMPA, It also supplies an overall
Accountant to insure proper handling of funds and transparency in accounting [including SHIMPA].
This will result in a more professional and timely approach to the problems and frees up the board
members to concentrate on policy issues and monitoring of the staff approach.

It will also place 1 technical officer at MDFA and CREMPA each, to deal with the specific problems of
the pass-on scheme and feeding and breeding advice and to develop cooperation at the ADD level.
The latter will be faced out as more qualified peOple become available from the FICA funded

Extension and Training intervention towards the end of this program.

A purchasing /maintenance manager and a salesman, will be put in place to do bulk buying of
supplies for the MBG’s and to set up regular schedule of delivery of semen ,liquid nitrogen,
veterinarian drugs and feed supplies to the MBG’s. An assistant will be put in place for dealing with
technical problems with the cooling systems at the MBG’s.

6.4 Time Frame

The program is scheduled to start in April 2010 or sooner as funds become available. The program
will run for4 years on a sliding scale as per Budget, to give the associations a chance to generate
more income through the proposed activities.

As soon as the program agreement is signed necessary staff will be recruited.

6.5 Budget

The budget is based on the needs at each association level. Some ofthe infrastructure is already in
place and the FICA funding will enable the associations to fill in their needs.
The first year has the highest allocation of funds as some major investments have to be made. The

following years the contributions will go down gradually with the fourth year being mainly

operational cost support.
The total Contribution from FICA will amount to € 500.000 over the 4 years, divided as follows:

 

l/

Year one € 200.000
Year two € 150.000
Year three € 100.000
Year four € 50.000
Total contribution € 500.000

In the Budget the first year has been detailed and some of the recurring costs have been allocated in
subsequent years. The ﬁnal consideration of allocation in the following years will depend on the
evaluation of the first and then subsequent years. This way it will be able to offset current and
political events that may take place.

As the budget shows, it has a sliding scale towards the fourth year. The salary cost has only slightly
been decreased to give the program its maximum stability and firmly establishes the role of the
positions of the personnel in the Associations. It was felt that by reducing this too early the
effectiveness and the sustainability ofthe program could be in jeopardy. in relation to the total
amount of the yearly contribution from FICA , the percentages will however increase dramatically as
the funding decreases.[although the actual amount decreases]

In the fourth year there has been no investment cost budgeted for. The reason for this is that
expected income streams should come on line to cover investment cost that then in turn shall lead
to increased income for the associations
Proposed budget in annex 3

Other contributors to the program are VSO (salaries and general costs VSO volunteers), Katete
(training facilities and 1 training officer), and MoAFS (office infrastructure).

6.6 Monitoring and evaluation

internal monitoring and evaluation will be done by the MMPA staff at a quarterly basis.
A yearend audit will be done at each association by an independent body
FlCA, as the donor, will put forward their own schedule of M and E.
