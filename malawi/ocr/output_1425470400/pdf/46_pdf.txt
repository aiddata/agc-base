Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any? Ref PAD D. 6, Technical Annex 10

Key issues related to the Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies triggered by this
project include environmental impacts such as soil erosion, soil, water and air pollution, loss of
vegetation; and social impacts such as loss of land or livelihoods, impacts on public health due to
asbestos removal from facilities to be rehabilitated; and an increase in water—related diseases due
to standing waters in borrow pits which are used as sources of construction materials. An
increase in solid and liquid wastes would further exacerbate the afore-mentioned impacts.

OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment

To enable project implementers to identify and mitigate potential environmental and social
impacts, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was developed by the
Borrower and cleared with IDA and the local stakeholders.

OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement

To enable project implementers to mitigate potential social impacts due to land acquisition, the
Borrower has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), which outlines the principles
and procedures to be followed in the event that land acquisition is required. The RPF was
developed by the Borrower and cleared with IDA and the local stakeholders.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Country and sector issues

Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world with an income of approximately
US$170 (2003) per capita and with a relatively small 2 billion dollar economy within a tight
ﬁscal framework. In addition, the country is geographically small with insufﬁcient arable land to
allow 11 million people to advance above prevailing poverty levels. The natural resource base is
predominantly agriculture; it is mainly concentrated on the export of tobacco and, as such, the
country is highly dependent on prevailing international tobacco prices.

Further constraints are experienced because of recurrent droughts, a high incidence of HIV/AIDS
(25% prevalence rate among women) and chronic malnutrition (49%). Concurrently, incomes
remain decidedly inequitable with more than 70% of the population deﬁned as poor. In the long
term, any possible per capita growth is dependent on increasing the land size of farmers but to
achieve this, a high number of farmers will have to move out of agriculture. The government will
have to improve the quality of education at all levels if it is to develop the industrial and service
sectors sufﬁciently to absorb the increasing number of workers.

Education sector

Improved access: Following the introduction of Free Primary Education (FPE) in 1994,
enrollment in primary increased dramatically from 1.9 million in 1993/94 to 2.9 million the
following year. Similarly, enrollment in secondary was substantially expanded as a result of the
introduction in 1998 of Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs). Thus, the government has
been successful in providing access to the majority of school-age children. However, because
both FPE and the establishment of CDSSs were largely unplanned, a high number of untrained
primary and secondary teachers were recruited and this has impacted negatively on learning
outcomes, retention and completion rates.

Key issues in the education sector: Education outcomes and quality can be viewed as a
production function with various interacting inputs and their combined impact on achievement
under a budget constraint. Three major issues affect education quality in Malawi and these are
outlined below. Each is critical but neither can be addressed separately: only a combined
remedial strategy to reduce their negative impact on the quality of education will prove effective.

This project was prepared as an urgent response to the crisis in the education sector. As
identiﬁed in the Government’s Letter of Sector Policy, the project, a bridging operation, will
support the consolidation and implementation of key education policies across the sector to pave
the way for a broader sector program. The project will complement existing government and
donor ﬁnanced projects, primarily to address the teacher capacity and management of teachers,
extemalities affecting retention and learning and build capacity to undertake the implementation
of a sector wide program.

Issue 1.‘ A high number of untrained teachers; limited capacity of the teacher education system;
uneven secondary school standards as a result of high number of untrained teachers and
inequitable deployment of teachers contributing to a decline in quality and low student retention:

The number of untrained primary teachers increased from 16% to 40% as a result of FPE. At
secondary level, the number of untrained teachers at CDSSs grew to 64%. As a consequence, the
average pupil qualiﬁed teacher ratio (PqTR) at primary level rose from 82:1 to 123:1 between
1994 and 2000 (this ratio is approximately 3 times higher than the 40-45 pupils per classroom
recommended for effective instruction). Furthermore, capacity in teacher training colleges and in
universities providing teacher education is inadequate to meet the high demand for both teacher
trainers and student teachers for primary and secondary educatiOn. This situation has contributed
to a deterioration in the quality of teaching in Malawi and has resulted in derisory learning
outcome: the recent Southern Africa Consortium for the Measurement of Educational Quality
(SACMEQ, 2000) study indicated that less than 1 percent of grade 6 pupils achieve ‘desirable’
levels in literacy and a mere 20 percent reach ‘minimum’ levels.

Efﬁciency is also low. This is exempliﬁed in the high repetition and drop out rates — repetition is
presently at 25% for primary as a whole and 40-45% for grade 1 pupils. Despite the fact that in
excess of 95% of all Malawian children commence school, less than 4 out of 10 pupils complete
grade 8. The lack of an effective secondary education system with a high number of untrained
teachers, in turn, impacts negatively on the caliber of students enrolling in teacher education
colleges or following higher education courses to become teacher educators. The supply of
higher education graduates, especially in the area of teacher development, is also affected by the
fact that with only 4,000 students enrolled in universities, higher education enrollment per
100,000 inhabitants is one of the lowest in Africa.

The secondary education sub-sector is also extremely inequitable. While the bulk of secondary
students enroll in CDSSs, the unit costs of these schools is about one ﬁfth of the per student costs
of their counterparts, the Conventional Secondary or Grant Aided Secondary Schools.
Furthermore, a number of conventional secondary schools fully staffed with trained teachers are
hampered in the delivery of teaching by a severely dilapidated environment and infrastructure.
Half of the CDSS structures and facilities are considered inadequate to provide acceptable levels
of teaching and learning and since the secondary sub-sector provides the stock of candidates who
will subsequently enroll in teacher education, university education, or in the private and public
sectors, uniformity and consistency in quality, especially of teachers, are critical if the overall
education system is to improve.

Issue 2: Weak capacity, combined with centralized service delivery and lack of prioritized
strategy; limited ﬁscal resources, combined with lack of implementation plans or expenditure
framework, contributing to ineﬂicient service delivery:

A further challenge across all levels of the system (at central Ministry, regional and district
levels, and at primary, secondary and tertiary levels) is the weak capacity to supervise and
implement activities and reforms - including donor projects. This phenomenon arises partly
because of high non-salary recurrent costs, presently estimated at the level of 5-10% (salaries
consume more than 90% of budget), staff shortages and a lack of performance incentives or

accountability procedures. Furthermore, a strategy to improve teacher development through a
clear national teacher development strategy has been both ambiguous and undecided for the past
two years. At primary and secondary school levels, the provision of textbooks and science
equipment has been inadequate and unpredictable and, in addition, pedagogical and school
management procedures remain unsatisfactory and invariably fail to ensure the efﬁcient use of
scarce resources. Finally, in View of the limited and constrained ﬁscal resources, the scope for
expanding the number of qualiﬁed teachers without IDA or donor support remains limited.

Issue 3: Externalities: Parental poverty and limited community involvement, HIV/AIDS and
malnutrition contributing to absenteeism and unsatisfactory retention levels:

The above two issues are further compounded by the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic: it
contributes to increased teacher attrition and high teacher and pupil absenteeism levels and it
impacts directly on teaching processes because of frequent and prolonged teacher illness.
Absentee rates are further raised, learning outcomes reduced and enrollment delayed because
approximately 50% of the Malawian population is currently chronically malnourished. The
problem is exacerbated due to limited resources at school level, the high direct cost on parents of
learning materials, and limited community involvement in education.

All of the above weaknesses in the Malawian education sector are compounded by inefﬁcient
and inequitable delivery of education services across the system and the use of human and
ﬁnancial resources in a manner inconsistent with deﬁned government policy objectives. In
summary, Malawi is far from reaching the targets set in the Policy and Investment Framework
for education (PIF) and in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Government Strategy

Education Sector Policy Framework: The government’s poverty reduction strategy1 identiﬁed
the development of the education system as a key priority. The education sector Policy
Investment Framework (PIF) and other policy documents2 outline the speciﬁc policy targets for
the sector until 2012. The PIF addresses both the need for improving the quality of basic
education and the need to improve quality and access to post-primary levels. For basic education,
the focus is on providing a suﬂicient supply of qualified teachers and essential teaching and
learning resources to achieve improved learning outcomes and reduce dropout and repetition
rates. At post-primary levels, the objective is to produce more graduates in order to provide the
number of teachers required at other levels of the education system and to meet the demand for
qualiﬁed labor from other sectors of the economy.

Recent experience with MIITEP, the in-service primary teacher development program, has
contributed to increased disquiet about the relevance of investing in this mode of teacher
development. However, well-trained, qualified teachers are key determinants to improved
learning outcomes and higher completion rates. As such, it is acknowledged that focusing on the
conditions necessary to bring this about is a priority and the recent Joint Sector Review (J SR,

 

1 Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) and Vision 2020.
2 Education Sector Policy Investment Framework (PIF) 2000-2012, the Malawi Education For All paper (MEFA
(draft)), and National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development (NSTED).

2004) reiterated the need for Government to develop a strategic plan that will provide a blueprint
for implementation of the PIP and the stimulation of a sector wide approach (SWAP).

National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development (NST ED) and Fiscal Sustainability:
During the pre-appraisal mission, February 2004, the Ministry of Education (MOE) reafﬁrmed
its commitment to improve the pupil qualiﬁed teacher ratio (PqTR) in primary schools from
123213 in 2000 to 60:1 by 2012 - a goal consistent with the PIP. Furthermore, Ministry evaluated
the options recommended in the National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development

(N STED) and communicated to the Bank its decision on a new primary teacher-training mode
(Annex 1). The preferred option seeks to improve the quality of education by strengthening
teachers’ pedagogical skills by providing a longer period of teacher training while at the same
time maintaining a high output from the teacher education colleagues by increasing their existing
capacity.

The selected training mode is a “1 plus 1” system: a one year residential course followed by one
year of supervised teaching practice in schools. This innovation will be complemented by
continuous professional development for teachers and through upgrading and training of teachers
and teacher trainers for post-primary levels. It is expected that the new teacher-training model
will be launched in January 2006.

To move towards the target of a 60:1 PqTR, the Ministry will undertake the following: (i)
increase enrollment capacity in the 6 existing TTCs from 2,730 to 4,000 students; (ii) construct
1-2 additional primary teacher training colleges with an enrollment capacity of 500-1,000
students each. GTZ is providing ﬁnance to implement the former, and the current Bank project
will ﬁnance one of the new TTCs. Finally, on the condition that all TTCs are used to full
capacity, GTZ may ﬁnance a second new TTC. These two measures will bring total capacity to
at least 5 ,000-6,000, and the expected output from teacher training to an expected 4,500 to 5,400
(assuming a pass rate of 90%) which will increase the number of qualiﬁed teachers following the
expansion in the capacity of the TTCs. Additional demand for teachers, if any, will be met by
implementing distance education utilizing existing college capacity.

The ﬁscal sustainability analysis (Annex 9) has shown that, given the most likely growth
scenarios, Ministry is unlikely to be capable of hiring more than approximately 4,000 new
teachers each year until 2012 - to make up for teachers lost through attrition (approximately
3,000 per year) and to gradually increase the total stock of teachers. According to the simulation
model used for the preparation of this project, 4,000 new teachers per year would ensure a
PqTR of 67:1 by 2012. As the existing 6 TTCs can enroll 4,000, one additional TTC with a
capacity of 500 students would be sufﬁcient to generate 4,000 graduates, assuming a pass rate of
about 90%. The number of new teachers required to reduce the PqTR to 60:1 by 2012 is
approximately 5,000 per year - assuming that the population of school-age children grows at
about 2% per year and improvements in repetition and dropout rates ensue as a result of better
quality. However, such a scenario appears ﬁscally unattainable at the moment, as the government
will have difﬁculty in hiring the new teachers.

 

3 According to preliminary EMIS statistics, this ratio was 95:1 in 2003.

Secondary and higher education teacher development will also have to expand to accompany the
expansion at primary level and to ensure that a sujﬁcient number of secondary school teachers
and teacher trainers are available. To achieve this, the GoM will expand university level teacher
development, including facilities and staff development, and complement the on-going
Secondary School Teacher Education program (SSTEP), presently supported by CIDA. CIDA is
likely to expand the support to the secondary education sub-sector, which in addition to the
higher education sub-sector is likely to be the prime focus of IDA support in the next operation.

As a result of the above policies, the total number of teachers in primary and secondary will
expand; this will impact on existing ﬁscal expenditures: government will need to allocate a large
share of their recurrent expenditure for education (about 4% of GDP or 17-18% of total recurrent
spending). At the same, government will need to be extremely prudent in managing spending in
the education sector. In the case of secondary education, enrollment grew sharply up to year
2000 (245,000 in public secondary); while in 2001-03, enrollment seems to have declined a little.
Still, the sector remains seriously under ﬁinded, in particular the CDSSs, and produces only
about 10,000 upper secondary graduates (MSCE) per year. During the pre-appraisal mission, the
Bank suggested to Ministry that enrollment in public secondary be limited to 245,000 students
while simultaneously focusing on producing more graduates by increasing per student funding,
particularly for the CDSSs. IDA’s proposed ceiling for enrollment in public secondary schools,
however, will not exclude expanding private secondary education but even with a cap on
enrollment, the share of the education budget allocated to secondary education may still need to
increase to ensure equitable per pupil spending. The current project, While addressing the
shortage in the number of trained secondary teachers will pilot alternative ﬁnancing and
management mechanisms in a few selected schools.

Based on the Malawi Country Status Report (CSR) ﬁndings, the Bank proposes that enrollment
in the university sub-sector be increased from the existing 4,000 students to about 8,000 over the
next 10 years but that this be achieved within the existing budget envelope. This increase could
be achieved by (i) using existing staff and facilities more efﬁciently, (ii) introducing shorter
degree programs (diploma, certiﬁcate and bachelor degrees), (iii) increasing enrollment of
parallel fee paying students and, (iv) generating budget savings through out-sourcing of non-
academic services. In effect, the universities in Malawi will need to radically improve their
existing resources, lower the current extremely high per pupil spending and eliminate the
subsidies provided to students through free food and housing. The share to higher education of
the total education budget should also be reduced but expansion beyond the improvements in the
efﬁciency and per student spending will need to be based on economic growth and labor market
demand. These undertakings will have to be elaborated in a strategy plan for higher education
including the ﬁnancing of higher education.

Decentralization and decentralized service delivery: Issues of accountability, discipline, control,
inspection, quality assurance and monitoring across the system are central elements in improving
efﬁciency. These will need to be addressed within the framework of decentralization, community
involvement and through redeﬁning the roles of the Ministry and districts in improving overall
service delivery.

On March 8, 1999, the Local Government Act for the National Decentralization Policy became
effective. The policy has ﬁve main features: (i) devolution of administrative and political
authority to the district level; (ii) integration of governmental agencies at the district and local
levels; (iii) transformation of implementation responsibilities to the districts; (iv) assignment of
functions and responsibilities to the various levels of government; and (v) promotion of popular
participation in governance and development in the districts. As the budget for the management
of teachers under the Government’s Decentralization Policy is transferred to the District
Assemblies, a unique opportunity arises for MOE to address some of the variance in teacher
deployment and to improve accountability and service delivery. Currently, MOE is preparing a
plan for the implementation of the act.

Another signiﬁcant policy that will improve service delivery, and possibly impact positively on
learning outcomes, is the National Strategy for Community Development. It lays out the key
policies and mechanism for reactivating the School Management Committees - these committees
exist in more than 98 percent of schools and seek to improve the involvement of communities,
parents and teachers. However, although a number of donors are already funding various pilots
and projects in support of community involvement and education, a signiﬁcant block in the
realization of the National Strategy for Community Development has been the absence of
funding to make the initiative operational. The IDA supported Direct Support to School will
address this issue by strengthening the social contracting and by providing conditional cash
transfers to the communities to be used for education purposes and inputs. This in turn will
lower household opportunity costs and strengthen parents and community involvement.

Externalities HIV/AIDS and nutrition: The government, supported by its development partners,
has developed a national strategy for HIV/AIDS and it is currently supported through the MAP
project. In addition, a 10-year national health program is being implemented. Through the
operation, outlined here, the Ministry of Education will seek to ameliorate some of the adverse
eﬁects on learning and attendance through a nutrition intervention initiative. In addition the
MOE has indicated its intention to pursue the issue of malnutrition and food-insecurity within
government.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Although Malawi has made signiﬁcant progress towards the achievement of universal primary
enrollment, it will be difﬁcult for the country to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of
universal primary completion. Meeting this challenge will require increased internal and external
funding for education and a closer collaboration between Government, development partners,
NGOs, and other stakeholders. Much of this additional funding is envisioned to be channeled
through a sector wide program, once the MOE has ﬁnalized its plans.

This project has been designed based on extensive sector work (Malawi Education Sector
Country Status Report No. 78) and through a collaborative process to address a limited number
of strategic areas within the government’s policy framework. Furthermore, Government and
other development partners have designed this project to complement existing interventions; the
development partners focus mainly on basic education, but the Bank seeks to support the
education sector in its entirety as a system, particularly in respect to teacher education. Thus, the

10

activities supported through this project is intended to complement existing programs and ﬁll any
gaps, while supporting the strategic direction and implementation of policies in a ﬁscal
sustainable manner.

This project will also provide key support to strengthening government capacity in order to
prepare it for subsequent implementation of a broader sector wide program. To facilitate this
process, the project will further emphasize donor collaboration and the setting up of a small, but
scaleable-pooled fund, With a view toward harmonizing ﬁduciary procedures and moving
towards a better-integrated sector program. Here, Government, development partners and the
NGOs have underscored the Bank’s technical capacity and leadership in policy issues in order to
move the education sector forward. As a result of Bank interaction and Government leadership,
there are, and have been, a number of encouraging and positive recent developments such as
further progress in the ﬁnalization of the NSTED.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The MPRSP, FTP and the Bank’s 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) acknowledge that
human capital is the key to poverty alleviation in Malawi and that education yields both broad
and economic beneﬁts. A healthy and educated population leads to higher productivity, better
income distribution and general improved standards of living.

By realigning education policies to overall ﬁscal resources and by emphasizing quality
throughout the system, the project will assist the government in improving the education sector
in Malawi and strengthening the supply and quality of its human capital. Thus both the MPRSP
and the PIP place emphasis on the improvement of access, quality, relevance and equity at all
levels of the education system as way of alleviating poverty in Malawi.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Lending instrument

The lending instrument for this operation is a Speciﬁc Investment Loan (SIL) Grant. An
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was considered pre-mature because the long-term elements of
the program require further work. The duration of the project is 5 years.

2. Program objectives and phases

At the request of the government, the project has been designed to provide immediate ﬁnancing
to support the education sector in Malawi. This ﬁnancing will be complementary to existing
donor ﬁnanced projects or programs to either ﬁll a gap or complement these to generate a higher
return on the overall investment.

The project also supports some preparatory activities to enable government, and the main
development partners, to enter into a sector wide program within a few years, and likely before
the conclusion of this project. As such, the project is considered a bridging operation that will
assist in a move towards a sector program supporting the implementation of the government’s

ll

Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) and the National Strategy for Teacher Education and
Development (N STED).

These two documents outline the govemment’s long-term education sector development
objectives and are perceived as goals that cannot be achieved by means of some targeted inputs
provided on a once-off basis. Rather, they require that interventions be provided in accordance
with a well-phased plan so the necessary implementation capacity is gradually developed across
all administrative levels.

In summary, the project is designed to consolidate existing sector policies and implement these
in a ﬁscal sustainable manner setting the overall direction of the education sector as articulated
and established in the Govemment’s Letter of Sector Policy. The project will complement on-
going activities thereby reinforcing these on- going activities with a priority given to teacher
development and management, externalities and activities that will support the development of a
SWAP and improve learning outcomes in the long run.

3. Project development objectives and key indicators

The project will improve education quality by improving the conditions and processes of
teaching and learning at the school level, and the capacity for education service delivery across
the education system by: (i) increasing the number of qualiﬁed teachers, (ii) improving the
capacity and the quality of education service delivery by fostering community participation and
by strengthening the management of human and ﬁnancial resources at district and primary
school levels, and (iii) improving learning outcomes at all levels by providing enhanced
conditions for school effectiveness that will contribute to changes in the behaviors of teachers
and students.

The causal effect generated by these interventions — addressing the number of qualiﬁed teachers,
improving the learning environment and addressing prohibitive extemalities will in the longer
run improve learning outcomes, retention and the completion rate and thus the move towards the
MDGs and government’s goals.

The following development indicators will be applied:

D.O. indicator 1:
Improve the PqTR in Standard 1-8 from 123:1 in 2000 to max. 80: by closing date (67:1 by 2012)

DO. indicator 2:
Improve the PqTR in CDSS from 102:1 in 2000 to max. 65:1 by closing date (58:1 by 2012)

DO. indicator 3:

As a proxy for improved conditions and behavior change at the pupil level: Deliver effective
school health and nutrition intervention to at least 80% of primary school pupils under the age of
10 by closing date.

12

D.O. indicator 4:

As a proxy for improved conditions and capacity for service delivery at the school level: Provide
DSS Grants: (a) Within the ﬁrst quarter of the school calendar year to some primary schools by
March 31, 2007; and (b) to at least 2,000 primary schools by closing date.

4. Project components

The following components and sub-components have been agreed upon for ﬁnancing. The
limited scope of component 2 was based on a negotiated agreement to ﬁnance a few selected
dilapidated conventional secondary schools on the condition of piloting new ﬁnancing and
management interventions. Detailed component descriptions are included in Annex 4. The
complementary nature of each component and how its ﬁts within existing programs and
activities is described in the matrix in Annex 2.

Component 1: Teacher Capacity Development (IDA allocation of US$155 million at base
cost): The component will complement government and donors’ efforts to improve quality and
expand capacity of teacher development and training at all levels: (i) Refurbishment of
Education Faculties at Chancellor College, Malawi Polytechnic, and new works at Mzuzu
University related to additional needs of secondary teacher education; (ii) Construction of a new
primary teacher training college; (iii) Staff development of lecturers at tertiary, secondary and
primary teachers colleges; and (iv) Student assessment surveys to establish a baseline against
which student achievement can be measured.

Component 2: Quality Improvements and Inputs (IDA allocation of US$3.7 million at base
cost): Improve the conditions of learning at selected secondary schools staffed with trained
teachers or newly trained teachers: (i) refurbishment of four Government secondary schools, and
(ii) provision of additional textbooks for graduating CDSS teachers (complementary to CIDA
ﬁnanced SSTEP).

Component 3: Mitigating externalities affecting the quality of education (IDA allocation of
US$3.0 million at base cost): Provide a School Health and Nutrition package to all primary
schools, which will include the following cost-effective interventions: distribution of Vitamin A
and iron-folic acid to school children under 10 years old, de-worming, treatment of malaria and
fever, and the promotion of good health and nutrition practices.

Component 4: Direct support to primary schools — DSS (IDA allocation of US$3.7 million
at base cost): Supply basic learning materials directly to schools while strengthening the
participation of communities in school management. The component will provide grants directly
to about 50% of all primary schools twice per school year, ﬁnance media campaigns, and
provide training for MOE staff at all administrative levels and to communities. School
committees will manage the grants, which must be used to purchase basic learning materials for
the school.

13

Component 5: Capacity Building and Policy Development (IDA allocation of US$1.4
million at base cost): 5.1 National education policy consolidation and capacity building: (i)
Develop a medium to long term prioritized and costed Education Sector Strategic plan to form
the base for a future SWAP; this strategic planning exercise may include a number of studies and
analyses, including sub-sectoral strategies like for higher education, ﬁnancing of higher
education, rehabilitation guidelines and mechanisms, national plan for nutrition; (ii) Develop a
teacher education policy, strategy and model for the system and a timed implementation plan;
(iii) Initiate discussions on the formulation of language of instruction policy; (iv) Assist
implementation of the new curriculum for primary level; (V) Build capacity and develop FM,
reporting and procurement procedures for a wider SWAP - based on expanded pooling
arrangements; (vi) Prepare operational plans for outsourcing hostels and catering under an
overall ﬁnancing plan for higher education - and other necessary activities, as required — at
universities; and (vii) Train secondary school managers, Portfolio of work/cluster training (as a
continuation of a SEP activity). 5.2 Support to implementation of Government
decentralization policy in education: (i) Development of a training and capacity building plan
for training MOE staff at central and decentralized levels in the context of their emerging
functions; (ii) Support implementation of training activities at district level; and (iii) Finance
other inputs for institutional strengthening of the districts.

Component 6: Project Implementation Unit and Contingencies (IDA allocation of US$4.9
million): This component will support the physical implementation and management of
ﬁduciary and procurement issues.

5. Lessons learned and reﬂected in the project design

0 Limited capacity: The two previous discrete Malawian education investment operations,
the Primary Education Project (rated unsatisfactory at closing) and the Secondary
Education Project (previously rated unsatisfactory but currently rated satisfactory)
experienced difﬁculties because of (i) limited capacity in Bank procurement processing,
(ii) lack of counterpart funding, and (iii) weak and insufﬁcient Government oversight and
supervision. In recent years, however, implementation capacity has improved and the
present project places a speciﬁc emphasis on training staff associated with the project. In
addition, the proposed grant is half the size of the previous Secondary Education Project.

0 Limited policy impact from stand-alone projects: It is difﬁcult to achieve policy reforms
for Malawian projects that focus on discrete activities. Accordingly, decisions about
sector wide policy issues cannot be separated from programmed activities and their
associated resource requirements.

0 Lack of planning and consistency in policy execution: Both FPE and the expansion of
secondary education were costly and unplanned policy decisions and appear to have been
taken without sufﬁcient regard for resource constraints in providing quality education.
This lack of proper planning emphasizes the priority of undertaking comprehensive
analytical work to ensure a coherent and well-deﬁned program — and one that fully
addresses implementation issues at the outset. The PPF is intended to ensure that most of
the preparatory work is completed upfront in order to reduce delays in the initial
implementation of the project. Further, continuation of the EDMU in this project, allied

14

to the experience it gathered during the SEP, will also contribute signiﬁcantly to a timely
commencement of proj ect implementation.

Sustainability: The importance of sustainability is acknowledged. It has resulted in a
comprehensive review of policy issues but realistic selectivity in the choice of activities.
However, it is also noted that in light of the state of the Malawian economy and other
associated factors, the education sector will require assistance for some time to come.
The Ministry is also taking steps to ensure the sustainability of textbook provision by
seeking to resuscitate the textbook revolving fund - started by DANIDA before it
withdrew from Malawi. In addition the ministry has agreed that it is necessary to limit its
expansion of public secondary education, depending instead on the private sector for
future expansion.

Delayed site selection: Questionable SEP site selection decisions resulted in delays in
completion and also contributed to unnecessarily increased construction costs. As such,
due attention has been paid to the selection of the site for the proposed teacher training
college, which has been accepted by IDA.

Contractor management: The questionable caliber of selected contractors and
supervisory consultants, contributed to poor workmanship and resulted in numerous
defects that must now be addressed during the liability period. As such, contractors and
consultants who performed poorly in previous assignments will not be considered for this
project.

Weak ownership: The key to successful implementation of the project is government
ownership that is allied to strong stakeholder collaboration. This has been addressed by
ensuring Government, through the Ministry of Education, assumed a leadership role in
identiﬁcation and design of the project. At all stages of the project cycle, Bank missions
involved relevant ministries and government departments, various development partners
and relevant NGOs. In addition, the Steering Committee that will oversee implementation
of the project, will comprise all the above key stakeholders; local communities will
equally be involved in those components where their input and collaboration is required
(for example, the DSS component).

The use of Citibank proved problematic in the implementation of the SEP. Bank
statements were not supplied on time and this led to delays in disbursement. It has now
been agreed with the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank in Malawi that for this
project, EDMU open foreign Bank accounts with local banks in Malawi.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

The two previous IDA projects were traditional investment operations in that they focused on
simple and single components. However, a project targeting single components - such as
textbook provision or building new schools - is unlikely to radically alter the nature of education
in Malawi and will certainly not contribute to system-wide capacity. On the other hand, the
government does not have the necessary systems, or the capacity, to manage a full sector wide
program. Therefore, a full SWAP was considered premature.

15

However, a more comprehensive approach appeared more appropriate and this was endorsed by
both government and development partners alike. Accordingly, the approach is based on the
government’s overall policy framework and reﬂects existing operational implementation
capacity. It also takes a broad view on the entire system and it’s ﬁnancing with the emphasis on
strengthening government capacity and it will complement major policies and policy issues,
programs, and activities implemented by other development partners and NGOs. The speciﬁc
IDA investment will be based on a narrow selectivity in priorities and components that will
complement, or ﬁll gaps, in the overall government program while spearheading a move towards
a better integrated sector wide program and pooling of ﬁmds.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnership arrangements

Donor collaboration in the education sector is strong and is reﬂected in continuing partnership
around key policy issues, such as NSTED. Current donor interventions (see Annex 2) by
USAID, GTZ, J ICA, DFID, ADB, UNICEF, WFP, UNESCO, CIDA, the Netherlands and
UNFPA target the primary education sub-sector, notably: teacher education, Teacher
Development Centers (TDCs), provision of learning materials and textbooks, classroom-based
assessment, curriculum development, district capacity building, school mapping and micro-
planning, primary school construction, national training of staff, HIV/AIDS and EMIS. In
addition to the World Bank, JICA and CIDA are supporting secondary teacher training (S STEP)
and in-service teacher training and ADB now intends to commence ﬁnancing rehabilitation of a
number of CDSSs. In addition, a core group on teacher development is being reconstituted.

The Bank, in collaboration with donors and other stakeholders and select NGOs, is endeavoring
to (i) consolidate efforts, (ii) provide a sharper focus for policy interventions that are in line with
overall resources, and (iii) create an increased dynamism for a more integrated sector wide
approach. Further, it is evident that the development partners welcome the Bank’s leadership
role in encouraging a SWAP, especially as the Bank is currently the sole donor adapting a
comprehensive review of the entire education system. A successful SWAP, however, needs to be
built on strong ownership by Government, teachers and parents and to include a predictable
public ﬁnancial ﬂow and, here, the recently completed Country Status Report will help chart the
way forward. In addition, the Bank project will support the overall objectives of the Malawi
Country Assistance Strategy (2003), the MPSRP and other sector policies articulated under the
PIP. The operation will complement sector issues addressed in the SAC, Health Sector Reform
Project and MAP. Furthermore, this project is the ﬁrst in a series of expected interventions to
support education over a 15-20 year period.

As an initial step towards better integration, the IDA will propose to set up a small, but scaleable,
pooled fund around the Direct Support to School (Component 4) and to encourage other donors
to join this pool. These discussions have advanced, but more work will be required. Furthermore,
the Bank will initiate work in relation to preparing a more consolidated expenditures framework.
To achieve such closer collaboration, further progress towards development of a SWAP is
desirable and, here, the recent J SR has continued to build, albeit slowly, on earlier work towards

16

ﬁnalization of a Memorandum of Understanding. Phase one of this process has lead to
formulation of a Code of Conduct for implementation of a sector strategic plan; it indicates a
framework for the relationships between Ministry and the cooperating partners in their efforts to
develop the sector. When signed, it will constitute a basis for introduction of the formal
Memorandum of Understanding, which will ensure closer synergy and less duplication of effort
across the entire education sector.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements

The main implementation agency for the project will be the Ministry of Education (MOE); it will
act on behalf of the Government of Malawi. A Project Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the
Minister (or Deputy Minister), will oversee project implementation and provide overall
guidance, particularly on policy activities. It will ensure that the overall objectives of the project
are met and facilitate resolution of problems arising during implementation. The PSC will
comprise the Directors of Departments and Institutes, heads of tertiary institutions, including the
universities, a representative of the Secretary of the Treasury, development partners and other
stakeholders, co-opted for special issues as the need arises.

A Technical Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MOE, will meet regularly (at
least once every two months) to review implementation of the various components and sub-
components and to facilitate resolution of any practical problems that might arise during project
execution. Ad hoc meetings will be called if and when necessary. The Technical Committee will
comprise all component managers, representatives of institutions executing the project
components and subcomponents, and EDMU. >

Component Managers have already been appointed for each component; they are responsible for
managing and monitoring implementation of the respective components. The Component
Manager for Component 1 is responsible for liaising with the two Universities and for
monitoring implementation of their components. The component managers will be supported by
technical specialists hired as consultants. The annual Joint Sector Review (J SR), organized by
the Ministry, the development partners and NGOs to the education sector, will also review
overall progress on implementation, particularly the achievement of the project objectives.

Procurement of civil works, goods and services for the project will be undertaken by the EDMU;
it has developed the capacity and experience in procurement and ﬁnancial management through
its SEP involvements. In addition, the two universities involved in the ESSUP have a degree of
expertise in procuring goods and also some executing and supervising capacity for small works,
mainly repairs. However, in recent years none of the institutions have managed major civil works
activities or complex goods and services procurement of the type and size to be provided under
the ESSUP and, as such, it is envisaged that the procurement process will be managed by
EDMU. Nevertheless, it is essential that the institutions be involved in all stages of procurement
in order to enhance ownership of the project, improve understanding and transparency of
procedures and strengthen operation and maintenance capacity within the universities.

Accordingly, it is firmly proposed that a working group be set up for each of the three
institutions (Mzuzu University, University of Malawi Chancellor College and Polytechnic) to

17

implement the civil works, goods and services aspects of the respective components; the groups
will be headed by a senior EDMU technical staff member and supported by relevant technical,
costing and procurement specialists (EDMU and/or hired consultancy services).

Under the DSS component, distribution of funds at the school level will be undertaken through
the District Education Ofﬁces. Implementation of this component will be carried out at the
divisional, district and school levels, and will include the school committees, selected by the
local communities. Since the project will need to develop capacity for new responsibilities at
divisional, district and school/community levels, it will include funds for relevant training
activities.

The School Nutrition and Health component will be implemented through twice-yearly
campaigns and other routine activities at primary schools developed by MOE and other
Ministries.

The proceeds of the IDA grant will be placed in a special account in a local commercial bank and
be replenished on the basis of statements of expenditures or by direct payment of suppliers on the
basis of required withdrawal applications. The following Bank accounts will be maintained for
project funds: (i) Special Account: to serve as the main project account into which project
implementation funds from IDA are deposited, denomination in US dollars; and (ii) Project
Account: government counterpart funds are deposited in this account, denomination in local
currency. The chart in Annex 7 illustrates the proposed banking and fund ﬂow arrangements.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

Project performance will be monitored through the Development Objectives Indicators and key
performance indicators, detailed in Annex 3 - all indicators are based on statistical data collected
on a yearly basis by MOE and on data contained in EDMU progress reports. Because of
difﬁculties in data collection in some areas, however, the project will conduct annual surveys and
reviews of speciﬁc sub-components, such as the Direct Support to Schools and Nutrition
components. The project will also ﬁnance two learning achievements assessment studies; these
will be carried out twice during the life of the project - an initial study, ﬁnanced by GTZ, is
scheduled for 2004. These studies will provide feedback on pupils’ learning achievements and
indicate the degree of progress in learning outcomes directly attributable to the project. The
Planning Department of MOE will be responsible for computation of the indicators and these
will be presented in the semi-annual progress reports issued by EDMU.

4. Sustainability

The proposed project is closely aligned with the PIP and complements government and donor-
ﬁnanced activities. The objectives, focus and components reﬂect government decisions arising
from discussions with both Bank and cooperating partners. As such, there is clear ownership.
Furthermore, it was agreed that this project be used as a stimulus for the development and
implementation of a number of policies, such as the recent decisions on NSTED. Finally, while
the development of education in Malawi will continue to require external funding, this project
will assist MOE in aligning their policies with prevailing ﬁscal resources and consistent with the

18

overall teacher development strategy. As such, it will improve both the sustainability and
implementation of policies and strategies and result in increased effectiveness in policy

execution.

5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

The overall risk rating of this project is medium (Substantial-Modest). The macroeconomic
environment is improving and ﬁscal discipline is being instilled, good governance is being

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economic and ﬁnancial analyses

Annex 9 outlines the economic and ﬁnancial underpinnings for the proposed operation. Careful
simulation of the proposed teacher development strategy, its feasibility and its impact on ﬁscal
resources were carried out and these form the basis for the proposed strategic direction supported
by this operation.

2. Technical
The technical design of the project is based primarily on the limited ministry capacity to
implement activities and execute policies and, as such, has emphasized simplicity and clear

objectives, where feasible. Furthermore, the proposed technical design and implementation
arrangements reﬂect experiences gained in the two previous operations.

21

Civil works are based on a review of various alternative designs and implementation options
considered and derived from the experience accumulated under the two previous operations.
Goods and services, and their costs and alternatives, have been reviewed with a View to cost
efﬁcient purchases. The Direct Support to School component is built on similar and successful
experiences in Tanzania and Mozambique, has been adapted to the Malawi context and builds on
strong incentives. The Nutrition intervention is using existing on the ground capacity (Save the
Children, UNICEF, WFP and NGOs) and experiences from other countries (Madagascar and
Senegal). Procurement of micronutrients will be implemented through the UNICEF procurement
ofﬁce.

3. Fiduciary

EDMU has put in place adequate ﬁduciary arrangements and will manage the new project. An
assessment of the ﬁnancialmanagement arrangements and procurement arrangements are
included. See annexes 7 and 8.

4. Social

When this operation is successfully implemented it will ensure enormous beneﬁts to the
Malawians. Directly, it will beneﬁt 3 million pupils and 50,000 teachers - or approximately 30%
of the population. In addition to improving the health and nutritional status of school age
children, it will have a signiﬁcant impact on the quality of education and attendance levels.
Furthermore, the capacity building through decentralized service delivery will improve the
efﬁcacy and efﬁciency of the system. The project will not pilot any new intervention; rather it
endeavors to reach every possible beneﬁciary. Finally, the project was closely prepared in
consultation with the development partners, local and international NGOs, teachers and teacher
unlons.

5. Environment

In recognition of the potential environmental and social impacts that are likely to result from the
planned construction and rehabilitation of educational facilities, the Borrower has prepared an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF). These documents are required because the precise locations of the
educational facilities to be rehabilitated or constructed are not known at this time, thus making it
impossible to identify speciﬁc impacts and to recommend appropriate mitigation measures.

Therefore, the project will use a Screening Process - the ESMF. The ESMF outlines an
environmental and social screening process, which will enable project implementers to identify
the likely environmental and social impacts, and to develop appropriate mitigation measures at
the planning stage of the construction and rehabilitation activities. The screening process
includes a requirement for public consultations and disclosure of their outcomes, to ensure that
the concerns of all relevant stakeholders, including potentially affected persons, have been
addressed appropriately prior to the commencement of construction and rehabilitation activities.
Potential environmental impacts are likely to include soil erosion, water, soil and air pollution,

22

and loss of vegetation; increases in solid and liquid wastes are likely to contribute to these
impacts.

The environmental and social screening process will also enable project implementers to identify
potential social impacts such as loss of land and/or livelihoods, trafﬁc accidents, asbestos-related
health problems, or an increase in water-related diseases due to standing water in borrow pits
which serve as sources of construction materials. To ensure that social impacts related to land
acquisition (loss of land and/or livelihoods) are mitigated appropriately, the RPF provides
guidance with regard to the principles and procedures to be applied in the event that land
acquisition is required under the project. Measures to mitigate potential impacts on the health of
the surrounding population will be devised at the planning stage and implemented as appropriate.

In light of the planned construction and rehabilitation activities, it is vital that appropriate
measures are taken during project implementation to ensure that the public’s health is protected
from environmental risks and pollution. The effective implementation of the ESMF and the RPF
will contribute towards this goal. v

6. Safeguard policies

The project’s safeguard screening category is $2, and its environmental screening category is B
due to the planned construction and rehabilitation activities. As a result, safeguard policies 4.01
and OP 4.12 have been triggered. Since the precise locations of the educational facilities to be
rehabilitated or constructed are not known at this time, an ESMF and a RPF has been prepared
by the Borrower. These documents include requirements for consultations, and appropriate
measures will be taken to ensure that the Borrower has the capacity to implement these
frameworks effectively. The ESMF and RPF were disclosed prior to appraisal.

Annex 1: Country and Sector or Program Background4
MALAWI: Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1

The education sector in Malawi is experiencing a serious crisis of low quality, low efﬁciency,
limited capacity and a shortage and inequitable distribution of human and ﬁnancial resources. As
a successful outcome of the 1994 implementation of Free Primary Education (FPE) — which
increased enrollment from 2 million to 3 million — most Malawian children, including the
poorest, now enroll in school. Regrettably, the combination of relatively low public spending on
education per pupil, inadequate numbers of qualiﬁed teachers, poor learning conditions and
extemalities affecting both teachers, parents and children has resulted in a deterioration of
learning outcomes.

Against this picture a stark reality confronts Malawi: it is a small country with only 10 million
people and with a natural resource base that is limited to agriculture and highly dependent on the
export of tobacco. In the next decades, the Malawian economy is likely to remain characterized
by a dominant traditional sector and a relatively small modern sector. The education sector needs
to provide the type of human capital that will meet the demand of both sectors, while
simultaneously helping the economy to move from its traditional to its modern sector.

Macroeconomic Context and Education Expenditures

Throughout the 1990s, Malawi’s economy grew by approximately 3 percent - or slightly less
than 1 percent above population growth. GDP per capita was approximately US$175 in year
2001 and Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world. By the end of the nineties,
recurrent education expenditure as a proportion of GDP in Malawi was somewhat below
countries like Uganda (3.2%) and Kenya (6.3%) - countries that are also expanding enrollment as
a result of a free primary education policy. However, in the past couple of years, recurrent
spending on education has increased, reaching 3.6% of GDP in the ﬁnancial year 2001/02.

Inter-sectoral budget allocations. One notable feature in Malawi is the fact that the share of
recurrent expenditures allocated to higher education (15- 20 percent) is higher than the share
allocated to secondary education (10-15 percent). This is signiﬁcant because approximately
245,000 pupils are enrolled in public secondary education while only about 4,000 students are
enrolled in higher education institutions.

Per pupil spending. The unit cost at the university level is between US$2,500-3,000, while it is
around US$10 in primary compared to around US$35 in other SSA countries, and roughly
US$40 in secondary as a whole. The latter is affected by the very low unit costs (approximately
US$20) and under-funded Community Day Secondary Schools (CDS S) where the bulk of
secondary students are enrolled. In comparison, the spending per student in the traditional
Conventional Secondary Schools (CSS) is approximately US$100.

Household Financing. Despite the abolishment of primary school tuition fees in 1994,
households still bear a considerable share of education ﬁnancing. In 2001, the majority of

Malawi —A Future of Limited Choices and Endless Opportunities. Africa Region Human Development, Working
Paper, 2004.

25

families reported paying for textbooks and uniforms and approximately half reported
contributing to the school development fund. In primary, mean household expenditures on
education average approximately 80 percent of per pupil public expenditures. These household
expenditures are regressive and the poorest households contribute more of their income to
education than the wealthiest. The relative high levels of expenditures of poor households are
possibly important determinants of dropout, particularly in primary.

Primary Education

In primary education, the learning environment is undermined by a very high pupil qualiﬁed
teacher ratio (PqTR) (123:1 in 2000) as a result of a shortage of trained teachers and the limited
capacity of the teacher training system; inadequate learning materials and school infrastructure;
overcrowded classrooms; and a teacher deployment system whereby teacher numbers vary
signiﬁcantly across schools and grade levels and between urban and rural areas. To compound
the problem, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is killing teachers and parents, raising absenteeism rates
of both teachers and pupils because of illnesses and the need for more help in the household.
With more than half the population chronically malnourished, especially during the hunger
period from January to April, absentee rates are further raised and learning outcomes reduced.
The poor learning conditions, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and chronic malnourishment has resulted
in very high repetition and dropout rates. Despite the fact that more than 95 percent of all
Malawian children eventually begin school, only about 60 percent complete standard 6 and some
4 out of 10 pupils (40 percent) complete standard 8.

Repetition, dropout, survival and completion. Although more than 95 percent of all children
enter primary at some point, most repeat several grades. The level of repetition is high
throughout primary, and is signiﬁcantly higher in lower primary than in upper primary, with the
exception of standard 8. The average is about 25 percent, while 40 percent of all children repeat
standard 1. The Monitoring Learning Achievement (MLA, 1999) study for ll African countries
recorded the highest repetition rates of all countries in Malawi in the ﬁrst four grades of primary.

The high number of repeaters and over-age pupils has increased the GER. The GER for standard
1-4 is 167 percent (1999/2000), but is only 70 percent for standard 5-8. While repetition levels
are high in the early school years, dropout rates are modest in the lower grades, but by the end of
standard 6, about 40% of the pupils have dropped out, and at the end of standard 8, about 60%.

The survival rate, or probability that a grade 1 student will still be in school by standard 8, has
actually diminished since the beginning of the nineties prior to the introduction of FPE.
However, due to a higher intake of students to primary school than before, more children in
absolute numbers and as a percentage of school-age children, do complete primary. Thus,
Malawi is on the right track by having hugely improved primary coverage and to a lesser extent
completion, but needs now to focus on reducing dropout and repetition in primary.

Learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are negligible: the Southern Africa Consortium for the
Measurement of Educational Quality (SACMEQ) study revealed that less than 1 percent of
pupils in standard 6 reach a desirable level in reading (20 percent reach a minimum level). Given
the limited learning outcomes and the low grade attainment, the wastage of resources are evident
and the room for efﬁciency improvements enormous.

26

Learning environment. As indicated in the Table below, there is a signiﬁcant discrepancy in the
PTR between lower grades and higher grades. This complicates the conditions for effective
teaching and learning especially in the lower grades. As can be seen the average PTR in standard
one is 100, but many schools and classes exceed this number.

 

Pupil teacher ratios, standard 1 — 8, 2000
Std 1 Std 2 Std 3 Std 4 Std 5 Std 6 Std 7 Std 8
100 76 64 52 45 39 33 28

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Further, there are signiﬁcant differences in pupil to teacher ratios between schools, particularly
between urban and rural schools. An analysis of the allocation of teachers to schools shows that
schools with 1,000 pupils can have anywhere between 5 to 40 teachers. Similarly, in schools
with 40 teachers enrollments vary between 500 and 3,800. These data corresponds to 34 percent
‘randomness’, one of the highest in SSA.

Externalities. In Malawi externalities plays a signiﬁcant role in the demand and supply of
education services. Absenteeism of pupils and teachers is a particular contributing factor to poor
learning achievement. Teacher absenteeism in Malawi is reported as chronic but the frequency
varies widely. In some schools, a teacher’s time-on-task was as low as 1-2 hours each day.
Geographic location of schools also presents a challenge. While 64 percent of children in urban
areas live within 15 minutes of the nearest school, this is only true for 33 percent of rural
children.

Malnutrition. Prevalence and consequences of malnutrition affect the opportunity costs of
education. Malawi has one of the highest levels of stunting in children in Eastern and Southern
Africa; almost half the children under 3 years of age are stunted. From the Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) 2000, it is apparent that many children enter standard 1 either short or
underweight for their age - 57 percent of children 4-5 years of age are stunted and an alarming 28
percent of children are severely stunted. Stunting and micronutrient malnutrition are associated
with reduced capacity to learn, delayed school enrollment, decreased school attendance, and
dropout - especially during the hungry period from November to April. Families keep children
out of school during this period so children can earn money to buy food or look for food. In
addition, hunger and fatigue are so severe that many children do not have sufﬁcient energy to
walk to school.

Impact ofHIV/AIDS. In 2001 the ofﬁcial number of primary teachers that died was 900. In
addition about 700 left the primary education system owing to normal attrition. Because
HIV/AIDS will continue to affect the mortality rate of teachers and the system will continue to
expand, the replacement of both primary and secondary teachers as a result of deaths caused by
AIDS will likely increase to approximately 3,700 teachers a year. HIV/AIDS will also
increasingly affect attendance and retention of both teachers and students.

Secondary Education

In secondary education, approximately 60 percent of the students enrolled in Form 1 proceed to
Form 4 (grade 12). Repetition, and early and late entry, further negatively impact on pedagogical
processes because of the broad range of skills and maturity in each class. By addressing the wide

27

age-range of pupils, the system could improve efﬁciency, lower repetition and dropout rates and
thus increase survival and completion rates. However, these are not the only determinants
affecting attainment in Malawi. Other issues like gender, geographic location and type of school
determines the levels of achievement and attainment.

In secondary education a particular inequity arises from the type of school in which a pupil
enrolls. In the Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSS), in which close to 75% of the
students are enrolled, the pass rate in the Malawi School Certiﬁcate of Education (MSCE) ﬁnal
exam in 2002 was less than 20% while in all other types of schools, the pass rate is between 40
and 60%. The low pass rate in the CDSSs is not surprising since, in general, the CDSSs are
under-funded and staffed by unqualiﬁed teachers (and the expenditures per student are about
one-ﬁfth of the expenditures in Conventional Secondary Schools (CSS)). The inequitable access
to good secondary education and the acute shortage of trained secondary teachers become
evident when the enrollment by type of school, PTR and percentage of qualiﬁed teachers are
considered as shown in the Table below. While there is no major difference in the PTR ratio
across the types of schools, it is clear that the majority of students in CDSS do not have access to
sufﬁcient number of qualiﬁed teachers.

CSS 57,624 49 88%

Private 27,793 41 86%

Night schools 3,117 20 54%

University Education

Relative to the size of its population, Malawi has close to the lowest proportion of students
enrolled in tertiary education in the entire Sub-Saharan region. Universities in Malawi enroll
about 4,000 students in total. The small scale of operation and the signiﬁcant spending on non-
core functions, in particular boarding and feeding, have created a low degree of efﬁciency in the
sector. Thus, both student to lecturer ratio (7:1), as well as the student to support staff ratio
(about 9: 1) are among the lowest in SSA, leaving ample room for adding students without
necessarily increasing costs.

MALAWI: Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1

The Following components and sub-components have been agreed upon. Component 1: Teacher
Capacity Development: (i) refurbishment of education facilities at Chancellor College and
Malawi Polytechnic, and new works at Mzuzu University, (ii) construction of a new Primary
Teacher Training College, (iii) staff development of lecturers at tertiary and secondary teacher
training colleges, and (iv) student assessment surveys. Component 2: Quality Improvements and
Inputs: (i) refurbishment of four Government secondary schools, and (ii) provision of learning
resources for newly graduated teachers who will be assigned at CDSS, Component3: Mitigating
externalities affecting the quality of education: provision of a health and nutrition package to all
primary schools. Component 4: Direct Support to Schools: provision of Grants to all primary
schools to purchase basic learning materials, as decided by the School Committees. Component
5: Capacity Building and Policy Development: (i) National Education Policy consolidation and
capacity building , and (ii) Support for the implementation of the Government’s decentralization
policy in education.

COMPONENT 1: TEACHER CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

This component includes: (i) refurbishment of education facilities at Chancellor College, the
Malawi Polytechnic and new works at Mzuzu University related to the need for additional
teacher education; (ii) construction of a new primary teacher training college; (iii) staff
development of students and lecturers at tertiary, secondary and primary teachers’ colleges; and
(iv) students assessment surveys.

1.1 NEW CONSTRUCTIONS AND REFURBISHMENT OF EDUCATION FACILITIES RELATED TO
ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING

1.1.1 University of Malawi Polytechnic

Speciﬁc Objectives
Through the assistance of the project, the University of Malawi Polytechnic will: (i) contribute to

efforts to reduce the secondary school teacher education shortfall, and (ii) improve the quality of
the education and teacher development provided by the institution and, thus, contribute to quality
improvements in secondary education. The Department of Technical Education of the
Polytechnic is training technical teachers through a 4-year program and, currently, the Bachelor
of Science technical education program has created an option to provide a Bachelor of Education
(Technical) degree program that offers additional education subjects in the 3rd and 4th years.
Presently there are about 160 students enrolled in the two programs. The assistance provided
under the project will allow for an enrollment expansion of 60 students. The training curriculum
is based on the secondary school curriculum, adopted by the Ministry of Education. The
institution has the ﬂexibility to quickly adapt training curricula to eventual changes that might be
introduced in the future in the secondary school curriculum.

Activities
To assist the Polytechnic achieve its objectives, the project will ﬁnance the following activities:

41

a) civil works (construction of a new workshop, of two additional laboratories for physics,
biology, chemistry, electrical, and electronics teaching, of a multimedia room for micro
teaching and a computer room, of a computer aided design laboratory, a drawing and
design room, a mini lecture room, of ofﬁces for lecturers and technicians.

b) acquisition of equipment and teaching/learning materials

c) a staff development program

d) consultancy services

e) selected consumables for the duration of the project.

1.1.2 University of Malawi, Chancellor College

Speciﬁc Objectives
The assistance provided through the project will enable the Chancellor College (i) improve the

quality of teacher education; (ii) facilitate a limited expansion of student intake; and (iii)
regularize continuing professional development programs, such as UCE in the Faculty of
Education. The College presently offers a four-year Bachelor of Education program, with a total
enrollment of approximately 800 students. The assistance provided through the project will allow
for a modest expansion in total enrollment; this requires quite limited physical expansion of the
College premises. The present training program, however, needs to be modiﬁed to reﬂect the
new secondary school curriculum, which introduced a number of new subjects. The assistance
provided under the project will enable the College to redesign its training curriculum
accordingly. Also, trainees will have the opportunity to be exposed to Information and
Communication Technology, both for their professional enhancement and, subsequently, to teach
computer studies to secondary school students, as required by the new secondary school
curriculum.

Activities
To assist the Chancellor College achieve its objectives, the project will ﬁnance the following
activities:

a) civil works (rehabilitation of existing lecture rooms and laboratories, repairs of existing
Audio Visual Center, construction of a computer room and a micro-teaching laboratory,
an additional lecture theatre, a repro graphic unit, and staff ofﬁces

b) acquisition of equipment and teaching/ learning materials

0) a staff development plan

d) consultancy services

e) selected consumable materials for the duration of the project.

1.1.3 Mzuzu University

Speciﬁc Objective

The university offers a four—year Bachelor of Education program, currently with a total
enrollment of 450 students. The assistance provided under the project will enable the Faculty of
Education of the University to: (i) improve the quality of teaching; (ii) undertake educational
research; (iii) expand total enrollment by 400 students; and (iv) strengthen the teaching
practicum in the overall teacher education program.

42

Activities
To assist the University meet its objectives, the project will ﬁnance the following activities:
a) civil works (construction of new classrooms, laboratories, and ofﬁces, the addition of a
computer room to the library, kitchen and dining hall, and hostels for 200 students)
b) provision of equipment and teaching/leaming materials
0) acquisition of library books, and subscription to periodicals and journals
d) a staff development plan
e) consultancy services
f) selected consumable materials for the duration of the project.

Implementation Arrangements for the Malawi Polytechnic, Chancellor College and Mzuzu
University

The institutions have some expertise in procuring goods and some executing and supervising
capacity for small works, mainly repairs. In recent year, however, they have not managed major
civil works activities or complex goods and services procurement of the type, and scope, to be
provided under ES SUPl. As such, it is intended that the procurement process be managed by
EDMU but to enhance ownership of the project, improve understanding and transparency of
procedures, and strengthen operation and maintenance capacity within the institutions, it is
essential that each be involved in all stages of procurement. Accordingly, it is proposed that a
working group be set up, headed by a senior EDMU technical staff member, and supported by
relevant technical, costing and procurement specialists (in house EDMU and/or hired
consultancy services) to implement the civil works, goods and services aspects of this
component.

A detailed description of the procedures is contained in the Project Implementation Manual. The
institutions will provide regular reporting to the Ministry and to EDMU on the implementation of
the project sub-component, in accordance with the overall implementation structure and
procedures of the project.

1.2 NEW TEACHER TRAINING COLLEGE

Speciﬁc Objectives
The project will ﬁnance the establishment of a new teacher education college for primary

teachers. It will have a total capacity of 540 students and: (i) increase the output of primary
school teachers, (ii) improve the quality of education provided to student teachers, and (iii)
improve the quality of teaching and learning at primary level.

Activities

(a) civil works (classrooms, laboratories, arts and crafts rooms, computer rooms, micro-
teaching room, library equipped with Internet facilities, ofﬁces, multipurpose hall,
kitchen and dining facilities, student hostels for 540 students, and staff rooms for 31 staff
members)

(b) equipment

(c) library books

((1) consultancy services

(e) selected consumables

43

Implementation Arrangements

It is envisaged that the procurement process be managed by EDMU. Execution will be overseen
by EDMU by hiring consultancy services for construction management. It is proposed that a
working group be set up within MOE/DTED, headed by a senior EDMU technical staff member,
and supported by relevant technical, costing and procurement specialists (in house EDMU and/ or
hired consultancy services) to implement the civil works, goods and services aspects of this
component. In order to improve the quality of works and ensure participation in post—delivery
inspection of goods, it is further proposed that senior staff of the new college be involved in the
ﬁnal stages of construction and goods delivery.

1.3 STAFF AND TEACHER DEVELOPMENT

Speciﬁc Objectives
The project will strengthen teacher development by implementing a series of focused

interventions to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in teacher training colleges as part
of primary pre—service teacher education and in institutions providing secondary pre- and in-
service teacher education.

Activities
a) Staff Development at Teacher Training Colleges
The project will support the following teacher development activities:

0 Provide sufﬁcient resources to ensure the continuance and further expansion of the
present UPIC Bachelor of Education primary degree program at Domasi College. This
will require: (i) setting up a training program for a further cohort of 24 M. Ed students to
a ensure a critical mass of trainers of trainers; and (ii) commencement of an additional
Bachelor of Education degree program in 2005 for 30 additional tutors at teacher training
institutions;

0 Provide technical assistance to review all infrastructure implications of expanding the
UPI program and agree priorities to ensure its success;

0 Provide funding to facilitate a one-week workshop to clarify B. Ed degree approval
procedures and agree an appropriate conferring institution;

0 Provide seed money to develop policy directives for integration of UPIC graduates into
existing TTCs and review ensuing staff deployment policies and practices;

0 Provide technical assistance to formulate an appropriate career structure for recent M. Ed
graduates (trainers of trainers) to ensure their retention in the system.

b) Institutional capacity development

0 Support setting up of the proposed Primary Teacher Education Linkage Committee to
facilitate institutional networking between existing teacher training colleges.

c) Implement pilot strategies to strengthen entry level capacities student teachers
0 TTCs to assess incoming student teachers’ entry levels in core academic subjects;

0 College staff to provide intensive, short-term remedial courses to ameliorate identiﬁed
student weaknesses during initial teacher training period;

0 Evaluation of the academic performance of participants against entry level baseline;

44

(1) Continuing Professional Development (CPD)/Distance Education
0 DTED to review current status of PEAs, their contribution to CPD and likely impact of
redeploying them as school inspectors;
o DTED to establish procedures to enable existing TTC tutors avail of core elements of the
current Domasi B. Ed degree program through Distance Education modes; and
o MOE to review DFID study on the use of Distance Education in teacher development and
implement the preferred option.

e) Teaching and Learning Using Locally Available Materials (TALULAR). Implement the
Malawi Institute of Education draft proposal to train TTC tutors, PEAs, senior school staff
and teachers in the production and use of prototype TALULAR resources. These readily
available materials will complement the range of commercial instructional materials
currently available in schools.

Implementation Arrangements

A strengthened DTED, with the continued support of DFID and GT2, will take the lead in the
above activities, liaise with Domasi College authorities, cooperating partners, TTC staff,
Virginia Tech and constitute an expert group to plan and prioritize the above core activities.
Progress is to be monitored by an expert technical committee.

1.4 STUDENT ASSESSMENT SURVEYS

The speciﬁc objectives of the Primary Achievement Sample Survey (PASS) are (i) to establish
the baseline against which student achievement can be measured and (ii) to identify the factors in
the school and home environment, which signiﬁcantly affect learning achievement and are
signiﬁcantly affected by policy interventions. The survey would consist of standardized testing
in mathematics of a small representative sample of students who are nearing completion of
Standard 3 and Standard 6 and be followed by interviewing the students, their parents, teachers,
and school administrators. The test items and interview questions would be adapted from World
Bank instruments, which have been successfully employed in investigations in many countries
around the world. The assessment would be done twice during the project implementation period
to enable MOE to analyze the data as a base for possible policy interventions. An expert
education evaluation consultant would lead a team of local consultants to collaborate with the
MOE testing unit for adaptation and pilot testing of the test instruments, the development of
sampling and analyses plans, the recruitment and training of test administrators, test
administration, and data processing and interpretation. The evaluation consultant would prepare
a report, which would be discussed with relevant ofﬁcials of the MOE, education stakeholders,
the donor partners, and the Bank. The project would support the international and local technical
assistance needed to carry out the assessment as well as the attendant costs related to test
preparation (including validation of test items and printing of computer-readable test
questionnaires), test administration (short-term hiring of test administrators, transportation, per-
diems) and data processing, and data analyses and report preparation. As a salient stimulus
toward formulation of sector-wide strategies, PASS would be developed for compliance with
national testing and evaluation policies and practices, supported by other development partners.

45

The ﬁndings of PASS would be compared to those countries of similar levels of economic
development, where the Bank has also assisted in similar assessments.

COMPONENTﬁZ: QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS AND INPUTS

This component will improve the conditions of learning at selected secondary schools staffed
with trained teachers or newly trained teachers and include: (i) refurbishment of four
Government secondary schools, and (ii) provision of learning resources for newly graduated
teachers who will be assigned to CDSS,

2.1 REFURBISHMENT OF FOUR GOVERNMENT SECONDARY SCHOOLS

Speciﬁc Objectives
The objectives of this sub-component are to improve teaching and learning conditions in four

secondary schools, which have enrollment of above 500 students each. The proposed schools are
Dedza Secondary School, Lilongwe Girls Secondary School, Blantyre Secondary School and
Mzuzu Government Secondary School.

One of the schools is a girls secondary school, which provides classes also for Visually impaired
students, with a specialized teacher. Almost all teachers are fully qualiﬁed. MOE has accepted
that the conditions for refurbishing the schools are: i) that the schools can retain the fees (or part
of them) at the school (this condition has been accepted by the Minister of Finance), ii) that the
retained funds will constitute a “school maintenance fund” to be used for a regular maintenance
of the school premises and equipment, and iii) that the boarding facilities will be used by the
students on a full cost recovery basis (no government’s subsidies). This last measure constitutes
also a condition for the disbursement of HIPIC funds to the government.

Activities
The project will ﬁnance the following activities:

a) civil works (refurbishment of classrooms, kitchen and dining halls, dormitories,
laboratories, ablution areas, some teacher houses. Special attention will be placed
on installing security measures, such as iron gates at the entrance of the buildings,
burglar bars on windows, and meshes where needed, to stop the rampant
burglaries and vandalisms presently occurring;

b) furniture and equipment

c) teaching and learning materials

(1) textbooks and reference materials for the school library (MOE will promote

measures to allow longer accessibility of the library to students).

2.2 PROVISION OF REFERENCE MATERIALS TO NEw TEACHERS 0F CDSS

To ensure that the quality pre-service training of the new teachers can make the expected impact
in the CDSS classroom, the project would provide to all graduating secondary level teachers
(about 250 over the period of the project) a package, complementary to the CIDA-ﬁnanced

46

SSTEP, of materials consisting of basic references, best practices in classroom management,
effective pedagogy, and classroom-based assessment of student progress.

Speciﬁc Objectives
The speciﬁc objective of this sub-component is to improve the conditions of learning and

teaching in those CDSSs where newly graduated secondary teachers will be posted. They will
have the possibility to apply what they have learned during their pre-service training. By
inference, this sub-component will improve the learning outcomes of CD88 students.

Activities

The project would provide textbooks and teachers’ guides for about 250 graduating secondary
teachers over the period of the project.

COMPONENT 3: MITIGATING EXTERNALITIES AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF
EDUCATION (School Health and Nutrition)

Background
As a result of poor food intake before the age of three years, more than half the children in

Malawi are stunted when they reach school age. Stunting in children delays their enrollment in
school because parents assume they are too small to walk to school. When children ﬁnally enroll
in school, many are not only stunted but are also underweight and deﬁcient in micronutrients and
this further reduces school performance and attendance. For example, both iron and iodine
deﬁciencies compromise ability to learn, and vitamin A and zinc deﬁciencies increase the
severity of certain illness, such as malaria, thus increasing the amount of time pupils spend away
from classrooms.

Objectives
To address the poor health and nutritional status of primary school children and its negative

effect on the education system, this component will provide a health and nutrition package of
cost-effective interventions through the primary school system. This activity will result in a
reduction of school absenteeism, particularly at the lower primary grades, and better learning
performance.

Activities

There are three major activities in this component: (a) build capacity of Ministry of (MOE) and
other relevant ministries to plan, implement and evaluate school health and nutrition programs;
(b) increase support for, and coordination of, school health and nutrition interventions among
relevant Ministries, donors and civil society; and (c) ensure the effective delivery of a school
health and nutrition package of cost-effective interventions to children attending primary school.

School health and nutrition has been an area of concern in Malawi for some time. A School
Health and Nutrition (SHN) policy is in draft and in 1998 MOE created the post of SHN
Coordinator. SHN activities are being supported and implemented by a number of different
organizations, with support from MOE, throughout the country, but there is currently no program
available for all children attending primary school. This component will support building
capacity in MOE and other relevant ministries to plan, implement and evaluate a national SHN

47

program. The component will also support capacity building through selected training and study
tours that will increase awareness and knowledge about implementing SHN programs. Activities
on the SHN component will be reported on a regular basis to the Task Force on Nutrition — the

group responsible for coordinating and sharing information on nutrition activities in the country.

The school health and nutrition package has been reﬁned through consultations with
government, donors and civil society. It will be delivered to primary school children in Malawi
and includes the following:

Control of helminth infections through twice-yearly de-worming

Control of bilharzia infection through twice-yearly treatment

Control of vitamin A deﬁciency through twice-yearly distribution

Control of anemia by providing iron-folic acid supplements weekly

Treatment for malaria

Treatment for fever and headache

Behavior change communications to promote good health and nutrition practices (e.g.,
improve sanitation and food intake and decrease infectious disease transmission).
0 Twice-yearly school testing for iodine in salt to promote the use of iodized salt by
families

Implementation Arrangements

The Ministry of Education (MOE) will lead and implement the component but other relevant
Ministries (e. g., Health, Gender, Agriculture, Economic Flaming and Development) will be
involved in the planning and implementation activities. A school health and nutrition component
manager (CM) will be hired by MOE to lead and coordinate this activity. Civil society will be
involved through the village head and school management committees.

The package of interventions will be delivered through twice-yearly campaigns and through
routine activities/services at schools throughout the school year. Relevant representatives from
government, donors and civil society will be oriented on the component, and trainers in each
district will identify teachers to train to deliver the package during campaigns and during routine
services. Teachers will be assisted during campaigns by staff from the Ministry of Health and
during the school year through supervision visits from staff from Ministries of Education and
Health. ‘

Social mobilization will be conducted before each campaign to raise awareness about the
campaign and encourage parents to send their children to school on the day of the campaign.
Social mobilization will be conducted through mass media messages and by community-based
organizations, where they exist. Behavior change activities (e.g., nutrition education messages)
will be used throughout the program to promote dietary improvement of school children and
their families.

It is anticipated that procurement of medications and micronutrients Will be through UNICEF; it

can provide competitive prices for drugs and nutrition supplements but further investigation
regarding this is needed. Delivery of the medications and micronutrients to the district level will

48

take place twice yearly, several weeks before each campaign to District hospitals and then to
health clinics throughout the district.

Monitoring and Evaluation _

As a proxy for providing a school health and nutrition package and improved health and
nutritional status of primary school children, the following Development Objective was
identiﬁed: Eﬂectively deliver a school health and nutrition package to at least 80% of primary
school children under the age of] 0 years by 2010.

This component will be evaluated for changes in the health and nutrition status and school
performance (e. g., attendance) of primary school children. Since all schools will receive the SHN
package, there will be no control group for the program and change will be measured using
cross-sectional baseline and end-line surveys. MOE and Ministry of Health will take the lead in
planning, designing, organizing, and executing the baseline survey before project effectiveness.
Activities for this component also will be monitored by teachers and their supervisors (e.g.,
coverage of students receiving the package during the campaigns, children treated for malaria
throughout the school year, etc.).

The project will finance:

a) the cost of the nutrition package delivered to primary pupils

b) capacity building through training programs for MOE staff and persons involved in
the execution of the component

0) study tours to observe similar programs in other countries of the region

(1) sensitization and information campaigns

e) workshops and seminars

COMPONENT 4: DIRECT SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS (DSS)

Speciﬁc Objectives
The Direct Support to Primary Schools Program has two main objectives: i) to support the

decentralisation of the management of primary education, with direct involvement of schools and
communities, in line with the decentralization policy of the Government, and ii) to improve the
quality of primary education at the school level by supplying basic learning materials to students,
teachers and schools.

It is widely documented that the direct involvement of school administration and communities in
managing their own resources leads to improved results and increases the accountability and
sustainability of educational programs. In the case of the DSS program, the objective is also to
improve the quality of primary education by supplying basic learning materials directly to
schools. The schools and communities (the last through the school committee) are responsible
for deciding which materials to purchase . The list is restricted to basic materials in order to
focus on providing schools with essential learning materials, not widely available (and to reduce
the private costs to parents), for example, blackboards, chalk, pens, pencils, exercise books,
maps, etc.

49

Activities
In order to implement the DSS Program a number of activities need to take place prior, and after,
disbursement of funds.

In summary, the following activities will be ﬁnanced under the project:

a) Technical assistance for the design of information and campaign materials (examples:
manuals, brochures, radio and newspapers spots, calendars, posters);

b) Technical assistance to coordinate implementation of the program during its initial
years;

0) Printing and distribution of the information materials;

d) Training of staff at central, division and district level;

e) Media campaign in the newspapers and radio;

f) Disbursement of a grant per primary school and district ofﬁce twice each year (average
200 USD per schools);

g) Contracting and undertaking an independent process evaluation of the program after
each stage of its implementation.

Implementation Arrangements

The program will be introduced at national level in two phases. The ﬁrst phase, ﬁnanced under
the project, will cover about 50% of all primary schools within the boundaries of the 34
education districts of the country. The districts are responsible for submitting to the Ministry
criteria for selecting schools that will receive the grants. Some donors have expressed some
initial interest in pooling funds to extend the grants to more schools. This pooling arrangement
could assist the Ministry in covering additional schools beyond the targets of the project.

MOE has the overall responsibility for implementation of the Direct Support to Primary Schools
Program. However, the various administrative institutional levels have different responsibilities
in terms of its implementation. At central level, MOE is responsible for: i) preparing the detailed
list of eligible schools, according to criteria decided for allocating these resources; ii) deciding
on the type and scope of the information campaign and preparing the materials necessary for the
campaign, implementation of the program and contracting the necessary technical assistance; iii)
setting up the ﬁnancial management reporting system; iv) providing training for the required
participants at division and district levels; and v) contracting an independent evaluation after
each stage of program implementation.

The division education ofﬁce is responsible for distributing the implementation materials to the
district level and monitoring the program within the context of other monitoring activities.

The district education ofﬁce is responsible for: i) opening the bank accounts and sending the
relevant information to the Ministry; ii) informing the schools about the program and distributing
the information materials; iii) issuing the checks to each school; and iv) keeping the ﬁnancial
records for each school and monitoring implementation of the program in the context of other
monitoring activities.

50

The primary schools and the communities are responsible for deciding how to use the funds, for
withdrawing the funds and purchasing the materials. In addition, they are responsible for keeping
a record of the materials purchased, together with the approved forms used. Detailed
implementation guidelines are shown in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).

Monitoring and Evaluation

The monitoring and evaluation activities will comprise; a) a process evaluation undertaken by an
independent company; b) a regular monitoring by the Ministry and its decentralized ofﬁces; and,
c) a ﬁnancial auditing which will be part of the general ﬁnancial auditing of the project. A
complete and systematic process evaluation of each implementation stage of the program will be
conducted by an independent company, contracted by MOE according to Bank procurement
guidelines. The main objective of the process evaluation is to assess how the different steps
required for implementing the program were followed by the different stakeholders, and the level
of satisfaction with the program. The various administrative levels of MOE will integrate the
monitoring of the program in the context of other monitoring activities being undertaken during
the year. Finally, the ﬁnancial auditing will be undertaken in the context of the ﬁnancial auditing
of the project and the results will be presented in the progress reports prepared by EDMU.

Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
MALAWI: Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1

The Ministry of Education (MOE) will be the main implementation agency for the
project, on behalf of the Government of Malawi. A Project Steering Committee (PSC)
chaired by the Minister (or Deputy Minister), will be responsible for overseeing project
implementation, and provide overall guidance, particularly on policy issues and activities.
The PSC will comprise the Directors of Departments and Institutes, heads of tertiary
institution including universities, a representative of the Secretary of the Treasury,
development partners and other stakeholders who will be co-opted for special issues as
needed.

A Technical Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, will meet
regularly (at least once every two months) to review in detail the implementation of the
various project sub-components, and to facilitate the resolution of any practical problems
that might arise during project implementation. The Technical Committee will comprise
all component managers, representatives of the institutions involved in the execution of
the project, and EDMU.

Component Managers have been appointed for each component; they are responsible for
monitoring the day-to-day implementation of the respective components. The component
manager for Component 1 is responsible for liaising with the two universities and for
monitoring the implementation of their sub-components. The annual Joint Sector Review,
organized by the Ministry, all development partners and NGOs to the education sector
will also review progress implementation and, particularly, the achievement of project
objectives. ‘

Procurement of works, goods and services for the project will be undertaken by the
EDMU, which has developed the capacity and experience in procurement and ﬁnancial
management through its involvement in the SEP. In addition, the two universities
involved in the ESSUP have a degree of expertise in procuring goods, and also some
executing and supervising capacity for small works, mainly repairs. However, in recent
years none of the institutions have managed major civil works activities or complex
goods and services procurement of the type and size to be provided under the ESSUP.
Thus, it is envisaged that the procurement process will be managed by EDMU.
Nevertheless it is essential that the institutions be involved in all stages of procurement,
in order to enhance ownership of the project, improve understanding and transparency of
procedures, and strengthen operation and maintenance capacity Within the universities.
Accordingly, it is proposed that a working group be set up for each of the three
institutions (Mzuzu University, University of Malawi Chancellor College and
Polytechnic) to implement the civil works, goods and services aspects of the respective
sub-components. The group will be headed by a senior EDMU technical staff member,
and supported by relevant technical, costing and procurement specialists (EDMU and/or
hired consultancy services).

59

Under the DSS component, distribution of funds at the school level will be undertaken
through the District Education Ofﬁces. Implementation of this component will be carried
out at the divisional, district and school levels and will include the school committees
selected by the local communities. Since the project will need to develop capacity for the
implementation of this component and for the related new responsibilities at divisional,
district, school and community levels, it will include funds for all the relevant training
activities.

MOE will lead and implement the SHN component. Other relevant Ministries (e.g.
Health, Gender, Agriculture, Economic Planning and Development) Will be involved in
planning and implementation activities. Civil society will also be involved through the
village head and the school management committees. The package of interventions will
be delivered through twice-yearly campaigns, and routine activities at the school level.
Trainers in each district will identify teachers to be trained to deliver the package.
Teachers will be assisted by staff from the Ministry of Health and MOE.

Details on ﬂow of funds for the project are contained in Annex 7.

Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
MALAWI: Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1

Summary of Financial Management Capacity Assessment

The Malawi Education Sector Support Project will be implemented in a medium to high risk
environment. Whilst this project is a follow up to the Secondary School Education Project
implemented by the Education Development Management Unit (EDMU) which had robust
ﬁnancial management systems and excellent accounting staff of requisite capacity to implement
a project of this nature, the grant component to schools at district and community level is what
increases the risk to funds made available for this project. The two colleges of the University of
Malawi (Chancellor College and Polytechnic) and the Mzuzu University, which are beneﬁciaries
of the project, pose another risk in that they have rudimentary accounting systems and in certain
cases weak capacity too.

At national level, the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessments(CFAA) and the 2001
Public Expenditure Review (PER) outline problems of budget execution in ensuring that the
allocated resources are utilized efﬁciently for the intended purposes and in obtaining comfort
that value for money has been achieved. Inadequate linkages between policies and budget
processes have made it impossible to measure outputs from activities where resources have been
utilized. Lack of compliance with established ﬁnancial regulations have rendered ineffective all
forms of internal control in the public sector making the existing systems even weaker.

A ﬁnancial management capacity assessment of EDMU which is the main implementing and
coordinating agency of this project, and that of Chancellor College, The Polytechnic and Mzuzu
University were carried out in April 2004 using Bank Guidelines issued by the Financial
Management Sector Board on October 15, 2003. No attempt was made to carry out a ﬁnancial
management capacity assessment of sample schools which would be eligible for grants in any
district as the results of doing so would have been obvious-weak capacity. The capacity of the
EDMU, the main Bank interlocutor on the project, was assessed as acceptable though the number
of staff and their levels and structure of the accounting department does not ﬁt the
implementation of a project of this nature.

The major risks arising from the assessment include low capacity for accounting at school and
community level to properly account for such funds. This will be further exacerbated by some
ﬂexibility in the fund usage at school level, which may subject such ﬁinds to abuse. Owing to
lack of identities in Malawi, the paying bank may pay to fraudulent people who may wish to
disguise as a representatives of the Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) where the school is
not careful with chequebook storage. Another major risk may be accountability of funds at
school level where some level of arrears on different expenditures have been accumulated owing
to inadequate funding from the Ministry of Education and project funds at school may be subject
to using them for clearing the arrears as funds are fungible. While the Malawi Savings Bank
(MSB) has branches in all districts and has been chosen to maintain school bank accounts, it
must be appreciated in some district it uses the Malawi Postal Corporation (MPC). Owing to
cash problems the MPC faces, it uses some of the deposits made to it by MSB customers which
in this case would include school accounts.

61

The following actions are necessary to mitigate some of the risks outlined above:

PTA and the school should keep simple memorandum accounts for all their expenditures.
All such expenditures should be authorized by the School Committee.

An attempt should be made to ensure that all members of PTA and School Committee
have simple identity cards for presentation to Banks. Once a member has been removed
such identity should be withdrawn. Where possible such members should compliment
their identity cards by their passports.

Each expenditure should be made by check and should be signed at each time by one
member of the School Committee and by the headmaster or his deputy.

The Ministry of Education should have a Memorandum of Understanding with the
Malawi Savings Bank preventing its agent, MPC, from misusing school funds.

Besides the mitigation factors outlined above, the following steps should be undertaken
to facilitate appraisal and subsequent processes of the project cycle:

Developing a speciﬁc chart of accounts for the project in its Financial Management
Accounting Handbook (currently in place) and to reﬂect this particular project's
transactions, Budget Codes to reﬂect project expenditures through IDA and government
contribution.

Review the current structure of the accounts department of EDMU, upgrade some of the
people therein, and determine expansion.

Develop terms of reference for a project internal auditor to work on project issues and in
close collaboration with the internal auditors of the Ministry of Education.

Develop terms of reference for a Finance Sub-committee of the Project Steering
Committee.

Develop terms of reference for the auditor of the project.

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

The implementer of the project is the Ministry of Education through the EDMU. A Project
Steering Committee (PSC) has been set up chaired by the Minister (or Deputy Minister) and
comprising the directors of departments and Institutes, heads of tertiary institutions including
universities, a representative of the Secretary to the Treasury, development partners and other
stakeholders who will be co-opted for special issues as needed. Implementation of the
components will be done by the various entities involved in the project but disbursements will be
done at EDMU level. The PTA will provide oversight functions over the school feeding
program as well as the direct support to schools component by holding the committees
responsible accountable for fund usage.

62

Budgetary and Accounting System

The Budget structure for the government of Malawi is divided into recurrent and development.
The budget is operated on a cash budget system. Guidance for its formulation is currently
governed by the Public Finance Management Act assisted by Treasury circulars. The Act
stipulates various accounting requirements from government entities which are vote centers and
government-managed projects in general. The instructions deﬁne reporting requirements,
responsibilities and level of authority within each Ministry and the types of books to be
maintained for purposes of accountability relating to budget implementation. The Treasury
instructions and circulars require all government ministries to submit monthly expenditure
returns which are used as a tool for monitoring budget execution. The report outlines
expenditures incurred during the month, against budget, variance from budget, commitments
made and cash balances in their holding accounts at the Reserve Bank of Malawi at the end of
such months.

The recurrent budget preparation cycle formally begins when the Ministry of Finance issues a
Treasury circular advising ministries to start preparing their budgets. Overall themes and
priorities for the budget are communicated in this and subsequent Treasury circulars. Budgets are
revised, aggregated and merged into one document, and ﬁnal adjustments are made before
presentation to Parliament.

The development budget is a summary of investment expenditures, comprising mostly of capital
and supporting operating costs. It accounts for close to forty percent of national budget. Most of
development budget in Malawi is donor funded.

The preparation of individual ministry budgets is supposed to be done through Activity Based
Budgeting (ABB). ABB was introduced as part of the MTEF reforms in order to facilitate the
implementation of prioritization by the MTEF process and to enable improved monitoring of
expenditure. ABB is intended to reﬂect the new output focus of public expenditure management.
In addition, ABB allows for a bottom-up approach to budgeting since individual activity based
budgets are prepared by cost center managers.

The draft budget document is sent to Parliament for further review, approval and the passing of
the Appropriation Act authorizing government to draw funds from the Consolidated Fund.
Treasury consolidates and draws up the approved budget. The Minister of Finance issues a
General Warrant authorizing the Controlling Ofﬁcers to incur expenditure on the approved
budgets. If passing of the Appropriation Act is delayed by Parliament, the Minister of Finance is
allowed to issue a Special Warrant authorizing Controlling ofﬁcers to incur limited expenditure
on their budgets up to three months subject to the passing of the Appropriation Act. When the
Appropriation Act is passed, a General Warrant supersedes the Special Warrant.

Funds Flow

The Project will use ﬁnancial management, disbursement and reporting arrangements that are
consistent with the guidance provided in the "Financial Monitoring Reports" guidelines issued by
the Operations Policy and Country Services in November 2001 for the entire life of the project
and the World Banks Disbursement Handbook in conjunction with the Financial Reporting and

63

Auditing Handbook, (FARAH) issued in 1985 for the ﬁrst year of the project. EDMU has
agreed on producing Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) from the start of the project which
will be used as a basis of disbursements. These reports have been reviewed and considered
satisfactory.

The ﬂow of ﬁinds for this project has been agreed as follows:

a) Funds to the Malawi Government under this project will be maintained in a grant account
at the World Bank. They will be maintained in Special Drawing Rights. Such funds will
be accessed through a special account maintained at a local commercial bank in Malawi.
The size of the special account will be determined by the projects cash ﬂow forecast for
the period.

b) The funds obtained from the grant through the special account will ﬂow into a Kwacha
‘ operational account where the foreign currency will be converted into local currency at a
rate of exchange ruling on the day of the transfer.

c) Funds from an operating account will be disbursed; i) for expenditures of various
categories of a number of components for the project paid at EDMU; and ii) grants to
schools will be paid direct into school account at a Malawi Savings Bank of the district.

(1) A small pool account to which a number of donors will disburse their contribution for
direct support to schools (and eventually school nutrition) could also be opened in a local
commercial bank. This account will be opened in foreign currency. Disbursements into
the foreign currency account will be made on a quarterly basis by the pool donors.
Transfers will be made from the pool account into a Kwacha account out of which
disbursements to schools and other supported activities will be made. Beneﬁciaries from
this pool account will have to submit quarterly returns as part of the FMRs as a measure
of accountability on the usage of funds. Disbursements for foreign purchases will be
made from this account.

Internal Audit

The MOE has an internal audit function whose main objective is to assist management improve
the level of internal control in the ministry. The capacity of the unit was assessed and found to be
inadequate. More staff needs to be employed to ﬁll the more than 80% vacancy rate in it and
perform its program on a risk-based approach. In the circumstances and the nature of
transactions that will transcend the schools, it is suggested that a qualified internal auditor be
engaged for the project. His terms of reference were developed and shared with the head of the
internal audit unit in the Ministry before negotiations.

64

Financial Reporting Formats

The project will prepare and produce quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). These
reports will comprise a ﬁnancial, output monitoring and procurement reports. They will also
provide information on the progress of the project in terms of ﬁnancial activity, key output
measures and procurement for the relevant period. As for the ﬁnancial reports, they shall include
statement showing for the period and cumulatively cash receipts by sources and expenditures by
main expenditures classiﬁcation, beginning and ending cash balances of the program, and
supporting schedules comparing actual and planned expenditures. The reporting line items in the
FMRs will follow the programs chart of accounts. The cumulative FMRs over the project year
will be consolidated and used as the project ﬁnancial statements. This will result in a more cost
effective reporting.

As for output reports, the program will include a narrative write up and output indicators linking
ﬁnancial information with activity indicators and highlight issues that require attention. In
procurement reports under the FMRs, such reports will provide information on the procurement
of goods.

The currency of the FMRs will be the Malawi Kwacha with the equivalent in dollars as a parallel
column. This will become beneﬁcial since the books of accounts for the project will be kept in
Kwacha, those of the special account will be in dollars, which will give rise to issues of
translation. The FMR preparation and submission will be done on a quarterly basis. These FMRs
will be used as a basis of disbursements. The reports will be submitted to the Task Team Leader
within 45 days of the reporting period. If such FMRs are not provided timely, the Task Team
Leader will follow this up with the project unit at EDMU to determine the reason for the delay
and planned date for submission. Late submission may result in the application of legal remedies
for non-compliance.

Counterpart Contribution
There are no counterpart contributions required.
Audit Arrangements

Audit of Public Enterprises which include government ministries, programs and projects is the
responsibility of the National Audit Ofﬁce in Malawi as articulated in the Constitution of the
Republic and the Public Finance Management Act. The National Audit Ofﬁce uses International
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) standards when carrying out its audits.
Annual and semi-annual audits of the project will be carried out by a private auditor acceptable
to IDA and other cooperating partners participating in the small pool. The draft terms of
reference for carrying out the two types of audits should be submitted to IDA for review. The
annual audit will assess whether; i) the information in ﬁnancial statements is fairly presented for
the speciﬁed period and cumulatively; ii) reported disbursements were made in accordance with
the Grant Agreement; and iii) whether expenditures as reported are appropriately supported by
adequate related documentation.

Owing to the number of components and the number of players (especially the participation of a
number of schools at district level), it shall be a requirement that separate semi-annual audits be

65

carried out for the Health and Nutrition and D88 components. Regular internal control checks
should be carried out to ensure compliance with ﬁnancial covenants, operation of special
account, efﬁciency and effectiveness of management in achieving the objectives of the project,
budgetary control systems and performance of the management of the ﬁnance, accounting, and
an evaluation of how the several cost centers in the way of schools and communities are
managing ﬁnances and exercising requisite internal controls within their unit. These semi-
annual audits will be carried out for respective six months periods as agreed with the IDA and
the cooperating partners for pool participants, and audit reports will be furnished to the
cooperating partners no later than two months after the end of the relevant six month period.

Disbursement Arrangements

MOE shall open two-dollar account. One will be a Special account and another dollar account at
a local commercial bank to be called project pool account. Upon satisfying quarterly release
requirements, IDA will disburse into the Special Account to be maintained in a local commercial
bank and a portion of the funds required for the quarter will be released into a pool account to be
maintained at a local commercial bank. The Government’s of Malawi quarterly release will also
be made into a separate local operating account, and another portion of its contribution into a
local operating pool account before the cooperating partner release of their portion. A pooled
local account will also be opened into which funds will be transferred from the pool dollar
account for disbursements for various uses.

Special Account

The project will have two Special Accounts (SA) which will be opened through the Ministry of
Finance in a local commercial bank of its choice. All requisite disbursement documentation,
whether relating to reimbursement through statement of expenditures, direct payments, special
account replenishments, or special commitments documentation will be initiated and kept by
EDMU. IDA should be informed of the special account opening in the commercial bank and
will deposit funds with the account once the project is declared effective.

Withdrawal application for reimbursement, direct payment instructions, and other disbursement
requests will originate from EDMU and be endorsed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Claims
Unit, who will send them to IDA. Payment instructions direct to suppliers will be sent through
the same route through commercial banks, as pursuant to IDA instructions.

Upon review and approval of submitted withdrawal applications, or payment instructions, the
IDA’s Treasury Department will pay grant funds being reimbursed into the project’s Special
Account at a commercial bank. Such funds will then be transferred from the Special Account.
The bank where the project accounts are maintained, shall submit a letter of comfort on Bank
funds from its headquarters to IDA. For the pool account, releases into it will be done on a
quarterly basis based on the ﬁnancing plan of the activities to be undertaken and the level of
accountability.

Upon receipt of such funds by the commercial bank from IDA through the Special Accounts, the
bank shall immediately notify the Ministry of Finance about the receipt. The Ministry of
Finance shall immediately issue a note called Credit Ceiling Authority (CCA) to the project’s

66

banks totaling the sums received. The purpose of the note is to inform the local commercial
bank that the project is allowed for the period to issue out checks not exceeding the amount
advised, pending receipt of some more funds which would necessitate issuance of another credit

limit increasing the limit for expenditure for the project.

Payments paid through the local accounts and all related documentation will be maintained by
EDMU for review by auditors and [DA implementation support missions. Upon receipt of the
commercial bank statements, the project accountant shall reconcile the bank accounts before
submitting the FMR to be also used as a withdrawal application to the Ministry of Finance for
onward transmission through the commercial bank to IDA.

The SAs will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA which would be appointed
prior to grant effectiveness based on an audit scope as contained in terms of reference acceptable
to IDA. The audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank six months after the end of each
ﬁscal year from review. One opinion shall be issued on the FMRs consolidated for the project for
the year.

Annex 8: Procurement
MALAWI: Education Sector Support Project 1

Malawi’s Procurement Environment

1. Malawi is in the process of procurement reforms. A new Public Procurement Act became
effective in August, 2003. The main considerations guiding the provisions in the Act are transparency,
efﬁciency and economy; accountability; fair opportunity to all bidders; prevention of fraud, corruption
and other malpractices; and to promote local capacity. The ﬁnal version of the Public Procurement Act is
assessed as a good UNICTRAL-based procurement law. The Act will be supplemented by regulations,
desk manuals and standard procurement documents. The ﬁnal version of the procurement regulations is
being reviewed by the government legal department. The Standard Tender Documents are yet to be
prepared. The Act deﬁnes methods of procurement and conditions for their use; the main principles and
procedures for methods of procurement; the establishment of the Ofﬁce of Director of Public
Procurement with oversight for public procurement; the establishment of Internal Procurement
Committees (IPCs) in each Ministry, Department and Para-statal; and review procedures. The Director of
the Ofﬁce of Public Procurement was appointed in March 2004. Other DoPP staff are expected to be
appointed from July 1, 2005 onwards following Ministry of Finance conﬁrmation. The Act is generally
consistent with good public procurement practice and includes provisions for: (i) effective and wide
advertising of upcoming procurement opportunities; (ii) public opening of bids; (iii) pre-disclosure of all
relevant information including transparent and clear bid evaluation and contract award procedures; (iv)
clear accountabilities for decision making; and (v) an enforceable right of review for bidders when public
entities breach the rules. A draft Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was discussed at a
workshop from May 12-13, 2004 and the Final CPAR with the Action Plans agreed during the workshop
was ﬁnalized by June 2004. The key action of the CPAR, the implementation of the Public Procurement
Act, operationalization of the Public Procurement Institutions (Ofﬁce of the Director of Public
Procurement, Internal Procurement Committees, Specialized Procurement Units) are part of the triggers
for the Fiscal Management Program and Accelerating Growth Program Project which was approved by
the Board in April 2004.

Use of World Bank Guidelines

2. All works and goods ﬁnanced under the IDA grant will be procured in accordance with the
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, May 2004. Consultants will be selected in
accordance with the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers,
May 2004. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures will be in accordance with the Public
Procurement Act and will include; i) an explicit statement to bidders of the evaluation and award
criteria; ii) national advertising with public bid opening; iii) award to the lowest evaluated responsive and
qualiﬁed bidder; and iv) foreign bidders would not be precluded from participation in NCB. Registration/
Classiﬁcation of contractors may be used for establishing bidder qualiﬁcation or for preparing a list for
use under price comparison procedure but not as criteria for bidding. With the exception of complex
information systems, the merit point system shall not be used as the basis of bid evaluation. “Bracketing”
or rejection of bids outside a range or “bracket” of bid values shall not be permitted.

3. The IDA’s Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) will be used for all International Competitive
Bidding (ICE) and, with appropriate modiﬁcation, for all NCB until acceptable national standard bidding
documents become effective. The IDA’s Standard Request for Proposals (SRFP) would be used for all
consulting assignments. The EDMU should ensure that each time they are using the most current version
of the appropriate SBD or SRFP and standard forms of evaluation. Less competitive bidding and selection
procedures should not be used as an expedient to by-pass more competitive methods and fractioning of

68

large procurements into smaller ones should not be done solely to allow the use of less competitive
methods or to avoid IDA review.

Advertising

4. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) is mandatory and will be published in the UN
Development Business as provided under the Guidelines. The GPN would show all ICB and all
consulting services estimated to cost USD 100,000 or more. Speciﬁc Procurement Notices (SPN) will be
required for contracts to be procured under ICB and NCB procedures and for consultant contracts
(estimated to cost USD 200,000 or more) to obtain expressions of interest (EOI) prior to the preparation
of the shortlist. The SPNs will be published in a newspaper of Wide national circulation. All ICBs and
Consultant contracts estimated to cost USD 200,000 or more shall be advertised in Development Business
online and in Development Gateway’s dgMarket. Sufﬁcient time would be allowed (not less than six
weeks for ICB and not less than 30 days for NCB and 14 days for E01) to allow adequate time for bidders
and consultants to obtain documents and respond appropriately.

Procurement Capacity

5. MOE through EDMU will carry out procurement under this project. EDMU has been carrying out
procurement for the Secondary Education Project (SEP) since 1998 to date. An update of the procurement
capacity of EDMU was carried out in May/June 2004. During the period of SEP implementation EDMU
has had at least three procurement Ofﬁcers who have since left and it now has one Procurement Specialist
who is being assisted by two engineers. This Procurement Specialist joined EDMU in March 2004 even
though he was once part of the EDMU staff two years before. The Procurement Specialist is adequately
qualiﬁed and has several years procurement experience. However the work load in the new project may
be too heavy such that he would need help to ensure that the project has adequate procurement capacity.
An Independent Procurement review (IPR) of the ongoing Secondary Education Project has also been
conducted in May 2004. Some of the key ﬁndings are: i) Record keeping for consulting services is
inadequate; ii) Delays in civil works contract implementation; iii) Delays in goods contracts
implementation especially textbooks; and iv) Delays in evaluation and award of contracts.

With regard to mitigating procurement capacity deﬁciency, EDMU will require to ensure the following: i)
The Procurement Specialist should get training in procurement of textbooks; ii) One of the two engineers
who have been helping on procurement will take full responsibility for procurement of works and
selection of consultants; iii) The two engineers handling procurement of works and consultant services
should undergo advanced works procurement training; and iv) The project will recruit a Junior
Procurement person to support the procurement specialist and maintain good procurement records.

Procurement Plans

6. MOE prepared a procurement plan for the ﬁrst 18 months of the life of the project which was
approved by IDA before negotiations. The procurement plan shows individual contract packages, their
estimated cost, procurement methods, whether domestic preference will apply or not, pre or post-
qualiﬁcation and estimated bid opening dates. Once approved the procurement plan shall be updated
regularly (at least once a year). As a result of the delay in presenting this project to the Board, the
procurement plan was updated in March 2005 following IDA no objection. Immediately upon approval
of the Project, with the borrower’s agreement, the plan will be published on the website, in the Project’s
data base and Bank’s external web-site. Main ICB and consulting contracts expected during the ﬁrst 18
months of Project implementation are summarized in the tables below.

Contract Management and Expenditure Reports

7. As part of the FMR, EDMU will submit 6-monthly reports to IDA not more than three calendar
months after the end of every semester. The FMR should include the status of (i) implementation of the
procurement plan, and (ii) contract management and expenditures on contracts.

Scope of Procurement and Procurement methods

8. Contracts for civil works estimated to cost individually USD 600,000 or more will be procured
using ICB procedures. Works estimated to cost the equivalent of USD 50,000 and below USD 600,000
equivalent per contract; may be procured using NCB procedures. Very small contracts estimated to cost
less than USD 5 0,000 equivalent may be procured by way of soliciting quotations through written
invitations from not less than three qualiﬁed contractors. Registration/Classiﬁcation of contractors may be
used to identify contractors for such very small contracts. The invitation shall include a detailed
description of the works, basic speciﬁcations, the required completion date, a simple form of agreement
acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings. In all cases the award of contract shall be made to the
contractor who offers the lowest price for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to
successfully complete the contract within the contract period taking into consideration all current/future
commitments. EDMU will be required to carry out due diligence and verify that the qualiﬁcation
information provided by the contractor recommended for the works is accurate.

9. To the extent possible, goods would be grouped into contract packages, and packages estimated
to cost the equivalent of USD 250,000 or more would be procured under ICB procedures. Procurement of
goods packages estimated to cost more than USD 30,000 but less than USD 250,000 may be procured
using NCB procedures. Goods packages estimated to cost less than USD 30,000 may be procured by
shopping on the basis of comparison of quotations from at least three eligible and qualiﬁed suppliers.
Requests for such quotations will include a clear description and quantity of the goods, as well as
requirements for delivery time and point of delivery.

10. Consulting Services and Training will consist of various studies including architectural design
work, construction supervision and technical assistance for civil works management, policy studies to be
carried out by both national and international consultants. As a rule, consulting ﬁrms for all assignments
estimated to cost the equivalent of USD 100,000 or more will be selected though Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCB S) methodology. Alternatively, Selection Under a Fixed Budget (SFB) or Least-Cost
Selection (LCS) procedures may be used provided the assignment meets the requirements of paragraph
3.5 in the case of SFB and paragraph 3.6 in the case of LCS. Assignments estimated to cost the
equivalent of USD 100,000 or more would be advertised for E01 in Development Business online
(UNDB online), Deve10pment gateway’s dgMarket and in at least one newspaper of wide national
circulation. In addition, EOI for specialized assignments may be advertised in an international newspaper
or technical magazine. The shortlist of ﬁrms for assignments estimated to cost less than USD 100,000
may be made up entirely of national consultants if at least three qualiﬁed ﬁrms are available at
competitive costs in Malawi. However, foreign consultants who wish to participate should not be
excluded from consideration. Consultant services estimated to cost the equivalent of USD 100,000 or less
may be contracted by comparing the qualiﬁcations of consultants. Auditors would be selected using LCS
procedures. In case of assignments requiring individual consultants, the selection will follow the
procedures stipulated in Section V of the Consultants Guidelines.

11. Training programs and workshops would be packaged in the project’s work plans and budget and
items therein procured using appropriate methods. IDA will review and clear any training packages.

73

12. Contracts under DSS sub-component, which meet the requirements of paragraph 3.15 of the
Procurement Guidelines may be procured using Community Participation procedure.

IDA Review

13. All works contracts estimated to cost USD 300,000 or more and goods contracts estimated to cost
USD 200,000 or more will be subject to the Bank’s prior review in accordance with the procedures in
Appendix I of the Procurement Guidelines. Any amendments to existing contracts raising their values to
levels equivalent or above the prior review thresholds are subject to [DA review. All contracts awarded
on basis of direct contracting will require prior review and clearance of IDA.

14. All single source selection will be subject to IDA prior review. Consultancy contracts with ﬁrms
with estimated value of USD 100,000 or more, and consultancy contracts with individuals estimated
value of more than USD 50,000 will be subject to prior review by the IDA in accordance with the
procedures in Appendix I of the Consultants Guidelines. Training/workshop programs will be subject to
IDA review prior to implementation.

15. Contracts which are not subject to prior review will be selectively reviewed by the Bank during
project implementation and will be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Appendix I to
the relevant Guidelines. Monitoring and Evaluation of procurement performance would be carried out
during IDA supervision missions and through annual ex-post procurement audits. At a minimum, 20% of
the contracts will be subject to post review. Annual independent technical audits (ex-post procurement
audits) would: i) verify that the procurement and contracting procedures and processes followed for the
projects were in accordance with the Development Grant Agreement (DGA); ii) verify technical
compliance, physical completion and price competitiveness of each contract in the selected representative
sample; iii) review and comment on contract administration and management issues as dealt with by
participating agencies; iv) review capacity of participating agencies in handling procurement efﬁciently;
and v) identify improvements in the procurement process in the light of any identiﬁed deﬁciencies.

Publication of Results and Debrieﬁng

16. Publication of results of the bidding process will be required for all ICBs, NCBs, LIBs and Direct
Contracting. Publication should take place as soon as the no objection is received, except for Direct
Contracting and NCB, which may be done quarterly and in a simpliﬁed format. For selection of
consultants, disclosure of results is also required. All consultants competing for the assignment should be
informed of the result of the technical evaluation (number of points that each ﬁrm received) before the
opening of the ﬁnancial proposals, and at the end of the selection process the results should be published.
The publication of results in selection of consultants applies to all methods, however for SBCQ and SSS
the publication may be done quarterly and in a simpliﬁed format. EDMU shall debrief losing
bidders/consultants on the reasons why they were not awarded the contract, if the losing
bidders/consultants request an explanation.

Fraud, Coercion and Corruption

17. EDMU and all other procuring entities as well as bidders/Suppliers/Contractors shall observe the
highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of contracts ﬁnanced under the project in
accordance with paragraphs 1.14 & 1.15 of the Procurement Guidelines and paragraphs 1.22 & 1.23 of
the Consultants Guidelines.

Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
MALAWI: Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1

Background

This annex presents the economic and ﬁscal impact analyses that have been guiding the
preparation and appraisal of the Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1. The annex includes
three parts: a) Selection of a teacher training strategy; b) Analysis of the ﬁscal sustainability, and
c) Cost-beneﬁt analysis summary.

SECTION A: SELECTION OF TEACHER TRAINING STRATEGY

In the early stages of proj ect identiﬁcation, a simulation model was developed in cooperation
with the Ministry to make projections for enrollment and teacher needs in primary and secondary
education in Malawi. The analyses presented in the following are based on this simulation
model.

Teachers for Primary Education. The model was used to analyze options for achieving the
government’s policy target6 of moving towards a pupil to qualiﬁed teacher ratio of 1 :60 by 2012,
and 1:40 in the foreseeable future. This analysis is based on certain assumptions about
population growth, pupil repetition and dropout, and teacher attrition. As indicated in Table 1,
enrollment is expected to grow at a somewhat slower pace than school-age population. This is
due to the assumption that the current high repetition rate will decline over time,’ as teachers
become increasingly qualiﬁed, so that pupils will move faster through the grades. It is also
assumed that dropout will decline over the projection period.

. As shown in Table 1, Malawi will need to train substantial numbers of primary school teachers
in the coming years in order to meet their 2012 target. In 2003, there were only about 32,000
qualiﬁed primary teachers, and this number would need to rise to 54,000 by 2012 to meet the
target.

During the preparation of ESSUP, the simulation model was used to analyze different strategies
for teacher education, in order to aid the government in selecting a comprehensive teacher
education strategy that would enable the country to achieve the 1:60 ratio by 2012, while
improving the quality of teacher education (see the discussion of the National Strategy for
Teacher Education and Development (N STED) in Section A. l. of the PAD). The proposed
teacher education strategies differed in the length of the period, which the students spent in the
Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) and in the scenarios for expansion of capacity of those
colleges. The comparison of the various strategies, using the simulation model, is provided in

Table 2.

Teacher attrition is assumed to be 6% per year for primary teachers.

It is assumed that grade repetition will decline from about an average of 17% per grade in 2003 to 11% by 2012 (15%
in Std. 1 and 8, and 10% in the others). Similarly, it is assumed that student dropout will decline from 8% per grade in
2003 to an average of 5% per grade by 2012.

The simulations show that the number of graduates from primary teacher education needs to be
increased from the current about 2,000 per year to at least 4,000-5,000 per year in order to reach
the policy targets by or soon after 2012. This can be achieved through a combination of
improving capacity usage of existing colleges, increasing the pass rate of students, and
expanding college capacity.

During the pre-appraisal mission in February 2004, the Government decided to move forward
with the Option 4 presented in Table 2 (and referred to in a letter from GoM in Annex 1), which
combines a pre-service teacher education program for new teachers, with a distance-training
program for upgrading existing un-qualiﬁed teachers in the system. With this option, the model
projects that the target of a qualiﬁed teacher pupil ratio will be reached by 2011. This option
includes an expansion of college capacity of up to 2,000 bed spaces by 2007.

Option 2, which represents a more prudent scenario from a ﬁnancial sustainability viewpoint,
would lead to 92% of teachers having received proper training by 2012, or a pupil qualiﬁed
teacher ratio of 65 : 1. In this case, 60:1 would be achieved by 2014. The ﬁscal viability of these
teacher education strategies is analyzed in Section B.

Teachers for Secondary Education. For secondary education, the policy targets —as expressed

in the Policy Investment Framework (P[F)- are to reach a Gross Enrollment Rate of 30% of the
primary school graduates (this target was accomplished soon after the preparation of the PIP) and

78

to expand private secondary education to about 25% of the total number of secondary school
students (currently around 10-15% of students are enrolled in private schools).

Data on enrollment in secondary school has varied signiﬁcantly over the past few years; from
275,000 in 2000 and 295,000 in 2001, to only 140,000 in 2002 and 167,000 in 2003. For the
purposes of this analysis, an enrollment of about 200,000 is used for 2003 increasing gradually to
300,000 by 2012. This corresponds to about 21% of 14-17 year-old in 2000 increasing to 26% of
the same age group by 2012. In the simulation model, it is also assumed that enrollment in
private secondary reaches 25% of total enrollment by 2012.

Table 3 shows the models projections of the need for qualiﬁed secondary teachers in both public
and private secondary schools, given a target pupil to qualiﬁed teacher ratio of 55:1 by 2007 and
30:1 by 2012.

Teachers for TTCs. Qualiﬁed teachers are also needed for the existing and future primary
TTCs. Assuming a student teacher ratio of 30: 1, the total need for qualiﬁed teachers at these
colleges will be about 300 including the planned expansion of 1-2 new TTCs.

Total need for teachers for secondary schools and TTCs. The simulations show that about
900 graduates from secondary teacher education are needed every year until 2012, in order to
reach a student qualiﬁed teacher ratio of 40:1 in secondary schools and in order to supply new
teachers to TTCs. After 2012, about 500 graduates are needed every year, unless further
expansion of the secondary school system will take place. '

Sensitivity analysis: Impact of HIV/AIDS on Teacher Attrition. The annual attrition rates
used in the model are 6 percent (3 percent death related, 3 percent retirement and drop-out
related) for primary school teachers and 5 percent for secondary school teachers. These attrition
rates may be in the lower end considering the HIV prevalence rate in Malawi of around 20
percent. According to the study “The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Primary and Secondary Schooling
in Malawi: Developing a Comprehensive Strategic Response”, evidence from the HIV/ADDS
pandemic in Uganda and Zambia suggests that the annual teacher attrition rate due to death could
increase to as much as 8 percent.

If the attrition rate rises above the 6 percent used in the simulation, it will —all things equal- take
longer time to replace the unqualiﬁed teachers in primary and secondary education. For example,
if primary teacher attrition rises to 8% instead of 6%, the pupil qualiﬁed teacher ratio in primary
will only reach 73:1 instead of 65:1 by 2012 (see scenario 2 in Table 2).

79

SECTION B: ANALYSIS OF FISCAL IMPACT

The implementation of the selected teacher training strategy has an impact on the recurrent costs
of education in two ways: a) the recurrent costs of teacher training increase as more new teachers
are trained; b) the salary envelope for teachers grows as qualiﬁed teachers are paid higher
salaries than un—qualiﬁed teachers. In addition, as the number of school-age children is expected
to grow over the projection period, the need for teachers and thus the recurrent costs will
increase further.

Reducing Inefficiencies. Hiring more qualiﬁed teachers will be costly for Malawi. Before
adding new teachers to the payroll, it should be made sure that existing resources are well spent.
Fortunately, the MoE -with the support of donors- has been confronting the problem of wastage
and inefﬁcient spending through improving the tracking of resources throughout the system. An
illustration of the results of this work is that there is now a good ﬁt between the number of
teachers on the payroll (based on payroll data) and the number of teachers reported by schools
(basic education statistics); both are around 45,000-47.000 teachers. This means that there is
probably not a signiﬁcant wastage in the teacher payroll; however, absenteeism of teachers due
to poor accountability systems has been widely reported to be a problem, and this reduces the
effectiveness of the public spending on education.

Scenario “Policy Targets”: Table 4 presents an estimation of the recurrent costs associated with
the teacher education strategies presented in Section A. The recurrent costs grow due to the need
for hiring more teachers to accommodate the demographic growth and reduce the pupilzteacher
ratios. The Table presents the costs of both Options 2 and 4 of Table 2.

It appears that, due to a signiﬁcant increase in the teacher salary envelope, the recurrent
expenditure on education would need to increase to between 4.2% (option 2) and 4.7% (option 4)
of GDP in order to meet the policy targets. This corresponds to between 26% and 29% of the
discretionary public budget (i.e. minus interest on debt, and pension & gratuities), assuming the
discretionary recurrent budget is 16% of GDP throughout the projection period.

Baseline data are for ﬁnancial year 2002/2003.
Assumptions: Annual remuneration is 5.5 multiples of GDP/capita for trained primary teachers, 2.91 for untrained primary teachers,
and 11.5 for trained secondary teachers.

Scenario “Fiscal Sustainability”:

Table 5 presents a ﬁscally sustainable scenario for expansion of the teaching force, deﬁned as a
scenario, which does not exceed a recurrent cost for education of 4% of GDP in any year. The
scenario illustrates how much the pupil teacher ratio can be improved within the ﬁscally
sustainable spending envelope, and how many teacher graduates can be hired every year.

Table 5 shows that, given the most likely growth scenarios, the Ministry is unlikely to be capable
of hiring more than approximately 4,000 new teachers each year until 2012 - to make up for
teachers lost through attrition (approximately 3000 per year) and to gradually increase the total
stock of teachers. According to the simulation model used for the preparation of this project,
4,000 new teachers per year would ensure a PqTR of 67:1 by 2012. The number of teachers
required to reduce the PqTR to 60:1 by 2012 is approximately 5,000 per year - assuming that the
population of school—age children grows at about 2% per year and improvements in repetition
and dropout rates ensue as a result of better quality.

Even in the ﬁscally sustainable scenario, the total number of teachers in primary and secondary
will expand; this will impact on existing ﬁscal resources: government will need to allocate a

large share of their recurrent expenditure for education (about 4% of GDP or 25% of the
discretionary recurrent budget). At the same, government will need to be extremely prudent in
managing spending in the education sector.

Table 6 and Table 7 provide more detailed projections of number of teachers trained each year in
the ﬁscally sustainable scenario, resulting improvements in pupil: qualiﬁed teacher ratios, and
ensuing recurrent costs of primary and secondary education, based on the simulation model.

SECTION C: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS SUMMARY

The project is expected to yield a series of beneﬁts as the quality of the education system is

improved. Speciﬁcally, the following quantiﬁable impacts are expected:

a) A higher number of children are expected to complete Primary School due to better-
qualiﬁed teachers (result of Comp. 1) the provision of basic learning material (Comp.
4) and a higher extent of parent involvement in school management (Comp. 4). This

84

cost-beneﬁt analysis quantiﬁes as a project beneﬁt: the increased lifetime earnings of
children, who would otherwise not have completed primary school.

b) As a result of the project, it is expected that a number of school-age children will
avert iron-deﬁciency. This analysis quantiﬁes as a project beneﬁt: the increased
lifetime earnings of these individuals, as they avoid the lower productivity and
intelligence in adulthood associated with iron-deﬁciency in childhood (Comp. 3.)

The ﬁrst of these two types of beneﬁts will come about as a result of not only ESSUP, but of a
Widely supported government strategy to improve the quality of education, of which ES SUP is
one part. This beneﬁt is therefore compared to the total costs of implementing this wider
strategy, i.e. government recurrent expenditure, ES SUP, and other investment costs.

Other Beneﬁts not Quantiﬁed: Some out—of—school beneﬁts from education accrue to society as a
Whole rather than to individuals: public goods or externalities. In Malawi, some of these beneﬁts
may be: better income distribution, health and nutritional beneﬁts of educating particularly girls,
reduction in infant and maternal mortality, reduced fertility. These beneﬁts have not been
quantiﬁed in this analysis, but could be signiﬁcant.

Cost-Benefit of Components 1 and 4: “Higher Completion Rate for Primary Education”.
As the quality of primary education is improved, it is expected that pupils will advance faster
through the grades of primary as their learning attainment improves. Thereby, more pupils are
expected to complete primary rather than dropping out of school. The steps involved in
quantifying this beneﬁt are:

a) Project how the pupil to qualiﬁed teacher ratio (PqTR) will improve as a result of the
intervention (this is already done in the simulation model analysis in Section A and B of
this Annex.

b) Assess how the completion rate depends on the pupil to qualiﬁed teacher ratio (PqTR),
i.e. estimate the elasticity of the completion rate to improvements in PqTR (linear
regression).

c) Estimate the increase in lifetime earnings of individuals with or without completion of
primary school.

(1) Calculate the total beneﬁt stream, and compare with costs of the intervention.
21. Projections of Impact on Quality. As a result of this intervention, the simulation model

showed that the pupil qualiﬁed teacher ratio can be assumed to improve from 95:1 in 2003 to
67:1 by 2012.

b. Linear Regression of Completion Rate as a Function of Quality. A linear regression based

on most recent statistical data for 55 low—income countries was carried out to analyze the
dependency of the primary completion rate on the average number of pupils per teacher in

85

comparable countries7. For all 55 countries, the elasticity was about —1.0, indicating that when
the pupil teacher ratio improves by one point, for example from 61 to 60, the primary completion
rate improves 1 point, e. g. from 38 to 39. A similar regression analysis based on the 33 African
countries in the sample yielded a somewhat lower elasticity of —0.6, indicating a lower
responsiveness in these countries to the pupil teacher ratio. The apparent lower sensitivity to the
pupil teacher ratio in African countries may indicate the presence of more other factors affecting
the quality of education, including poverty, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, etc. For the purposes of this
analysis, an elasticity of the primary completion rate on the average number of pupils per teacher
of —0.6 is used in line with the above regression for the African countries.

c. Economic Beneﬁt of each Additional Graduate. This is the increase in earnings for a
student holding a primary school leaving certiﬁcate compared to a person with no completed
education. In the study “The Determinants of Poverty in Malawi, 1998” 8, the 1998 Integrated
Household Survey was analyzed for, inter alia, linkages between education level and household
consumption. The study found that higher levels of education do consistently provide higher
levels of welfare for the household in every region of the country: it concluded that, for every
increase of the level of education by one step (no education, standard 4, standard 8, JCE,
MSCE), per capita consumption of an adult increased by 22% in the rural south, by 19% in the
rural central, by 11,5% in the north and by 17% in urban centers. For the purposes of this
analysis we estimate that a standard 8 graduate earn on average 30% more than a person with no
completed education. In this analysis, this has been translated into an average annual earning of
primary school leavers of 2.8 multiples of GDP/capita compared to 2.2 multiples per capita for
persons with no completed education, for the duration of their working life (assumed to be 25
years).

d. Benefit Stream. The beneﬁt stream can now be estimated as the product of two factors: the
increase in individual productivity for each additional graduate, and the increase in the number
of primary school graduates. Table 8 presents the beneﬁt stream of the intervention to improve
the teacher training supported by the project.

6 Assuming a lag of six years before the improvement in pupil teacher ratio impacts fully on completion rate.

Thus, the expected improvement in the primary completion rate will yield a socio-economic
beneﬁt of about 200m US$. This must be compared with the project costs, and the expenditure
required by the Government of Malawi, and contributions by other donors (see Table below).

The recurrent cost increment takes into account a cost saving to the education system, because of
the lower repetition rate that will result from a better learning environment. This cost saving may
well amount to several million US$ per year9, but as it is already included above, it has not been
estimated separately.

Cost-Beneﬁt of Component 3: “Averted Iron-Deﬁciency”. A cost-benefit was carried out of
the iron supplementation part of the health and nutrition package (Comp. 3). This analysis
attempts to quantify the greater productivity of the individuals receiving the health and nutrition
package, and thus averting iron-deﬁciency, as they become adults.

This analysis thus does not estimate the beneﬁts of other parts of the package (Vitamin A, folic
acid, deworming, treatment for malaria, bilharzia, etc.), which are expected to have signiﬁcant
positive impact on attendance in school. These interventions, for example vitamin A
supplementation, have been proved in other settings to be highly cost-effective.

There is known to be a negative impact of iron deﬁciency — the most common nutritional
deﬁciency — on the cognitive abilities in children. In Malawi, according to the report on the
National Micronutrient (and Nutrition) Survey (NMS), conducted from September to October
2001, iron deﬁciency prevalence among school children is about 23%. For the purposes of the
cost-beneﬁt analysis, we are thus making the simplifying assumption that the project will avert
iron deﬁciency and this cognitive depairment in 23% of the target population (all school children
under 10 years of age). However, this may be a very conservative assumption, as Save the
Children found an anemia/iron-deﬁciency prevalence of about 48%. Component 3 will ﬁnance a
baseline study and an on- going evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention; this will
provide more reliable data on the iron-deﬁciency prevalence, and allow for an ex-post
calculation of project cost-beneﬁt.

 

9 For example, if repetition in the Malawi student population of 3m primary school pupils drops from an average of
25% to about 20% as a result of the project, the savings would amount to a total of US$2m annually.

87

Additional assumptions of this analysis are provided below. These are consistent with recent
research to estimate the economic implications of iron deﬁciency“):

a)

b)
C)

d)

An iron deﬁcient child (older than 2 years) scores on average half a standard
deviation lower on intelligence tests than a non-deﬁcient child. The decline in
cognitive function has been found to be reversible following the repletion of iron
stores.

The intercorrelation between IQ scores at age 6-8 with those at age 17 is about 0.62.
It has been found that a one-half of a standard deviation decrease in scores on various
tests of cognitive achievement is associated with at least 4% decrease in hourly
earnings.

Thus, it can be assumed that childhood anemia is associated with a drop in wages in
adulthood of2.5% (=4%*0.62).

Improvement in cognition associated with iron status requires maintenance of iron
status throughout the ﬁrst 15 years of life. A simplifying assumption is therefore, that
each year in which the child is not anemic locks in one-ﬁfteenth of the 2.5% increase
in wages in adulthood.

The ES SUP project will ﬁnance the delivery of the school health and nutrition package for four
years, after which time we assume the component will be continued with other funding. As
indicated in the Table below, the iron supplementation will target all school children under 10.

1 According to preliminary EMIS 2003 statistics, there were 1,519,000 under-lO-year-olds enrolled in primary in
2003. An annual growth rate of 2% is assumed.
2 This is calculated as 23% of the target population, as the current iron-deﬁciency prevalence in school children is
about 23%.
3 This is calculated as 1/ 15 of the present value of 2.5% of an average Malawi lifetime income. It is estimated that

average wages are about US$157 per year at 2004-prices. A discount rate of 6% has been used to discount future
earnings.

Cost-benefit of the school health and nutrition package. The out-of—pocket cost of the total
package is about 3m US$. The iron supplementation part of the package amounts to about 1.5m
US$ of the 3m US$. The value of the staff time needed to administer the package (opportunity
cost) is approximately 360,000 US$ per year (5000 schools*2 staff"2h/week*48 weeks).
Including opportunity costs, the total cost of administering the iron supplementation package is
thus about 2.9m US$ for a 4-year program.

88

 

The beneﬁt—cost ratio of the iron supplementation package, under the conservative assumption
that 23% of school children suffer from iron-deﬁciency, is thus 3:1 excluding opportunity costs,
and about 1.621 including opportunity costs (teachers time for training and distribution).

Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues
MALAWI: Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1

Key issues related to the Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies triggered by this
project include environmental impacts such as soil erosion, soil, water and air pollution, loss of
vegetation; and social impacts such as loss of land or livelihoods, impacts on public health due to
asbestos removal from facilities to be rehabilitated; and an increase in water-related diseases due
to standing waters in borrow pits which are used as sources of construction materials. An
increase in solid and liquid wastes would further exacerbate the afore-mentioned impacts.

0 OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment
To enable project implementers to identify and mitigate potential environmental and social
impacts, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was developed by the
Borrower and cleared with IDA and the local stakeholders.

0 OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
To enable project implementers to mitigate potential social impacts due to land acquisition, the
Borrower has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), which outlines the principles

and procedures to be followed in the event that land acquisition is required. The RPF was
developed by the Borrower and cleared with IDA and the local stakeholders.

Dear Mr. Schafer,

MALAWI - EDUCATION SECTOR POLICY

I am writing on behalf of the Government of Malawi to request a Credit of US$322
million equivalent from the World Bank in support of the Education Sector Support Project. The
project is intended to improve access and quality at all levels of the education sector in Malawi
as outlined in the Ministry of Education Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) and the Malawi
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP).

In addition, the project will facilitate the formulation of a Sector Wide Program (SWAP)
for the Education Sector, building on the objectives of the Government’s Policy and Investment
Framework (PIF), and of the National Strategy for Teacher Education and DeVelopment
(NSTED). These two documents outline the government’s long-term education sector
development objectives which are basically to increase access, improve quality and efﬁciency,
and to develop institutional and ﬁnancial capacities.

The project will address these sector development objectives in the education sector by
increasing the provision of teachers and learning and teaching resources across the sector,
institutional capacity building and improving the health and nutritional statuses of pupils in
primary schools. It will also support appropriate measures on HIV and AIDS prevention and to
mitigate the impact of the pandemic on education personnel and pupils. The objectives will also
be achieved by develOping the relevant policies that are crucial to the development of the
education sector in Malawi and align the sector strategy to available ﬁnancial resources.

98

Planning for the Education Sector

The Government of Malawi will develop an Education Sector Strategic Plan which will
be the vehicle for implementing the Policy and Investment Framework. The Sector Strategic Plan
will include an integrated plan for higher education development. The Strategic Sector Plan will
facilitate the development of a SWAP in the education sector which will bring about a better —
coordinated and efﬁcient use of all resources in the education sector in the medium to long term.

Financing of the Education Sector

The Government of Malawi is committed to increasing the share of the total budget
allocated to education from the current level of approximately 15% to about 20%, with the share

provided for primary education being maintained in the region of 60-70% during PIF target of
65% by December 31, 2007.

In order to improve ﬁnancing at the secondary school level, it is Government’s intention
to allow secondary schools to retain the tuition fees paid by students, instead of remitting these to
the Ministry of Finance, once the appropriate ﬁnancial management systems are in place at the
Secondary Schools. Government has further decided to provide funding directly to the
secondary schools and to strengthen human resource capacity at the schools so as to ensure that
there is proper accounting of funds. This exercise will commence in the 2004/5 ﬁscal year. The

retained fees will be used by the institutions to carry out refurbishment and maintenance works
and provide additional learning and teaching materials.

In addition, the Government will develop a policy for the ﬁnancing of the higher
education sub-sector. This policy will take into account the need to increase access to higher
education within the existing resource envelope by considering and introducing measures such as
cost sharing and cost recovery and targeted student support where needed.

National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development

Through the Ministry of Education, the Government has developed a draft National
Strategy for Teacher Education and Development (NSTED). Government will therefore finalize
this strategy and adopt it for implementation before the beginning of the school year in January
2005. The strategy will provide for an efﬁcient teacher education system that will produce
teachers who are urgently needed in the system and also provide for the continuous development
)f teachers in order to prepare adequately for the needs of the sector. In order to effectively
ichieve the implementation of this strategy, Government will revamp the structure of the
uroposed Department of Teacher Education and Development and staff it fully.

Associated with the develOpment of teachers is the efﬁcient utilization of this scarce
source in Malawi. In this regard, government will address the current inequitable distribution
‘teachers which is in favour of urban areas. This will be done through the creation of and strict
herence to the teacher establishment of each school and the provision of incentives for those
10 opt to teach in remote and disadvantaged parts of the country. As part of the Government’s
N wage policy, the Government has reviewed and revised salary scales for all civil servants,

99

including those of teachers and other Ministry of Education staff, with effect from 15‘ October
2004. It is envisaged that future reviews will include incentives for rural teachers, and this is a

must if we are to retain trained teachers in these areas, and will make decontralization and
deployment of teachers more effective.

Decentralization

Consistent with the commitment made by Government in the Financial Management and
Accelerating Growth Program (January 2004) Government will decentralize primary education
management, by transferring the associated funding of these activities from the Ministry of
Finance directly to the Local Assemblies. To this end, the Ministry of Education, working
closely with the Decentralization Secretariat in the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development, will develop the necessary devolution policy and guidelines for the effective
transfer of the management of primary education to Local Assemblies, including the efﬁcient
and equitable management of teachers in all the districts of the country.

Secondary Education

The secondary education sector plays an important role in the overall development of the
education sector in Malawi since this is the sector that prepares students for skills training and
entry into higher education. This sector of education consists of community day secondary
schools where the majority of students are enrolled and government conventional secondary
schools, most of which require rehabilitation. Lack of ﬁnancial and human resources has made it
difﬁcult for government to improve the quality of secondary school education.

In order to address these problems and create a more uniform quality secondary

education sub-sector, as well as ﬁnance the increasing number of trained secondary teachers,
government will;

(i) allow secondary schools to retain fees at the school level for minor repairs and
acquisition of teaching and learning materials;

(ii) rehabilitate some conventional and community day secondary schools;

(iii) increase the number of qualiﬁed teachers in community day secondary schools;

(iv) encourage cost recovery and cost sharing at all government secondary schools;
and

(v) promote the expansion of quality private secondary education in a well regulated
environment.

The HIPC completion trigger number 3 for the education sector requires the phasing out
of government funding for boarding facilities for secondary students and the reallocation of the
freed resources to learning and teaching materials. However the Ministry of Education has
raised some concerns about the lack of adequate private accommodation close to secondary
schools. The increasing incidence of HIV AIDS and orphans is also a serious concern and, here,
the absence of adequate girls’ hostels can exacerbate these social problems. The Ministry of
Education will, therefore, continue to provide facilities but with the outsourcing of their
management and on a full cost recovery basis where applicable.

100

Efficiency In Tertiary Education

GOVemment will take steps to improve efﬁciency in the utilization of scarce resources
through the outsourcing of non-core activities, particularly those associated with the housing and
feeding of students. In order to counteract the negative effects, such an arrangement may have
on the well being of students, government will also develop and implement a viable and

sustainable student funding policy. In this regard Government will introduce bursary and
scholarship schemes for disadvantaged students.

Noting govemment’s inability to increase resources allocated to tertiary education in
Malawi, cost sharing and cost recovery measures will be introduced and promoted in tertiary
education. The UniVersity of Malawi Act will also be amended to facilitate the enrollment of
fee-paying students at the University of Malawi. In addition, other tertiary institutions will also
be encouraged to run parallel fee-paying programs. The objective of these measures is to

enhance the revenue of these institutions and reduce their dependence on subvented allocations
from Central Government.

The implementation of these measures will necessarily require the retrenchment of
employees who are providing the services associated with the non-core activities. Government

will provide resources to the affected institutions in order to enable them to retrench the
redundant employees.

Implementation and Monitoring

The Government of Malawi is committed to the successful implementation of the
Education Sector Support Project (ESSUP) and other Government programmes being
implemented with financial assistance from other development partners. The Ministry of
Education will be the implementation agency for the Project, on behalf of the Government of
Malawi. The Project will be managed by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) that will be
chaired by the Principal Secretary of the Ministry and comprising of Directors of Departments
and Institutes, heads of tertiary institution including universities, the Secretary to the Treasury,
the Secretary for Health, the Secretary of Human Resource Management and Development, the
Secretary for Economic Planning and DeVClopment, the Secretary for Labour and Vocational
Training, the Accountant General, the.Secretary for Local Government and Rural Development,
the Solicitor General and Secretary for Justice, Development Partners and other stakeholders,
who will be co—opted for special issues as needed. Local communities will equally be involved
in those components where their input and collaboration will be needed.

Conclusion

The Government of Malawi remains committed to the overall policies as indicated in the
Policy and Investment Framework and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and the Education for All (EFA) goals through a collaborative effort with Malawi’s development
partners. The approval by the World Bank to provide the Government of Malawi with the
requested Credit will assist the Government to achieve these goals and objectives for the
betterment of Malawi.

101

The government will continue to call upon the World Bank and bilateral donors to

support the education sector as described herein.
