1. Back ground Information
This section should show as pre-
cisely as possible the general nature
of the project for which the expert is
required, stating whether it comes
within the Govemment‘s
developnrent programme. it is
important to indicate whether the
project is a new enterprise or whether
it was started previously. In the latter
case, any assistance received under
other technical cooperation
programmes (e.g. under United
Nations auspices) should be stated.
With regard to industrial enterprises,
some impression of the size is
important and the output and number
of workers to be employed are useful
indications. The type of process,
make and age of industrial or
scientiﬁc equipment with which the
expert will be concerned should be
speciﬁed. In the case of academic
establishments, it is an advantage to
know the number of annual intake of
students, their level of attainment,
numbers and status of existing staff
and details of any research facilities
and the level of research being
undertaken (Copies of brochures,
annual reports, ﬁnancial statements,
calendars, syllabus of instruction etc.
should be attached where
