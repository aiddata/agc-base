2.1. Overall objective

The 0 verall o bjective r elates to the p urpose o f the M alawi-EC C SP A griculture & Natural
Resources Sector support, namely: “Contribute to increased household income and improved
food security in areas of intervention through more sustainable management of natural
resources. "

2.2. Programme purpose

"To improve the livelihoods of forest dependent communities (men, women, boys and girls)
through improved sustainable collaborative management of ﬁsrests both in forest reserves and
customary land. "

2.3. Expected Results
Result 1 Sustainable livelihood strategies promoted within impact areas
To meet the immediate needs of forest dependent commumtles through supporting the

advocacy of the rural poor; to promote action learning and the generation and sharing of
knowledge to both improve rural livelihoods and achieve more sustainable management of
natural resources.

 

 

annual implementation schedule presented in Annex B. Phase I aims to enhance the capacrty
and collaboration of key stakeholders and service providers, as well as initiate community
level interventions. Speciﬁc targets for phase one activities are captured in the Result
indicators presented in the Programme logﬁraine. Phase 2 will replicate and expand support

both within and to additional forest dependent communities and be the subject of a second
Financing Agreement.

Activities under Result 1: Sustainable livelihood strategies promoted within impact
areas.

The Programme will establish collaborative partnerships with local extension agencies, civil
society and other development programmes, co~located within the 12 Programme

timber forest product development, including: beekeeping, guinea fowl rearing, medicinal
plant collection, and ﬁ'uit juice processing. The Programme will in the ﬁrst instance support
activities where there is an existing market to ensure immediate ﬂows of beneﬁts and
secondly support activities where potential markets are as yet undeveloped.

Activities under Result 2: Secured equitable access to forest resources through
increasing the area under sustainable forest management arrangements.

The Prograrmne will support community-based management of customary land forest areas
and shared management of State Forests. Management of common pool resources requires

2.6. Lessons from past experience

Project evaluations (MTR & FEv) as well as periodic EC independent monitoring reports, of
the EU Social Forestry Training & Extension Project indicated success with positively
inﬂuencing attitudes and behaviour of both ﬁeld staff and communities, through building
capacity and promoting improved forest management, to improve rural livelihoods.
Furthermore, the Final Evaluation Report, highlighted that co-management of State Forest
Reserves was not addressed and therefore was an issue for future attention. Evaluations of the
SF TEP and other ﬁeld projects have also highlighted concems with food security issues in so
far that the impact on forest and forest resources is linked to rural household agricultural

productivity and periods of food insecurity and vulnerability experienced by these households.
2.7. Linkage with other operations

The Programme is complementary to a number of EC programmes addressing poverty in
Malawi. These include the current EU Public Works Programme, the proposed Farm Income
Diversiﬁcation Programme, the EU Micro Projects Programme 4, as well as the National
Initiative for Civic Education, which'supports democratisation awareness and uses natural
resources as one of its entry points to rural communities. The Programme has been designed
to link to these programmes and collaborate where they are co-located.

2.8. Results of economic and cross-sectoral appraisals

Forest goods and services are of major economic importance and have a signiﬁcant
contribution to the rural household economy in Malawi, coming second to crop production.

households and their livelihood strategies. The level of dependency, varies from household to
household, with some having a greater dependency on forest products for subsistence, while
others who may be more food secure depend on forests for their income generating activities.
However, these immediate livelihood coping strategies are resulting in unsustainable levels of

future support to rural livelihoods. Loss of forest cover in Malawi has resulted in rapid run-off
leading to increased local erosion and ﬂooding, resulting in loss of life, reduced agricultural
productivity, and a negative impact on the macro economy through loss of hydroelectric

production. Certain species 0 f flora and fauna, although 11 ot internationally e ndangered are
under threat locally through habitat loss.

Appraisals indicate that many community organisations and related institutions are inherently

men. In access and control over forest resources, women usually have access but limited
control. These gender relations signiﬁcantly shape livelihood strategies.

Multi-sectoral coordination, institutional linkages and the participation of other agencies and
organisations in the District planning processes is weak. Although the sector-wide National
Forestry Programme 2001 clariﬁed the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders in

 

covering the 12 identiﬁed impact areas illustrated in Annex C.
