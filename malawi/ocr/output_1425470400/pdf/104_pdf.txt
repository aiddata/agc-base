Michael,

I understand that you have been in Brussels on business as I have been trying to contact
ou to mention some developments on the local government elections in Malawi which are
“planned for next April.

The note attached from Vinnie provides the background and outlines what approach the
Embassy is taking.

The decision of the President to suspend the members of the Electoral Commission and lock
down the offices of the Commission are being viewed by the development partners as a
positive step as it provides clear evidence that mismanagement of funds is not acceptable
to the Government. The audit which highlighted this mismanagement was of Government
funding for the 2889 presidential and parliamentary elections. No direct donor funds were
involved. All of our, and other development partner, support was channelled through the
UNDP Trust Fund and is accounted for.

Development partners have been aware of the outcome of this audit and HOMs have received
assurances from the Minister of Finance that the Government are putting in place various
measures to ensure that there is no repeat and that any fraud identified by further
forensic audits will be followed up. The President's actions are seen as part of that

iesponse.

In relation to the local government elections planned for next April, we have earmarked
488,888 euros for support of the elections through the UNDP basket fund and a further
138,888 euros for a civic and voter education campaign to be managed by a local civil
society group. The agreements have been signed but we had not made the disbursements

pending clarification from Government on the recent developments described above and in
the attached note.

Based on the clarifications received — I have also spoken direct to the UNDP and to the
Minister of Finance . I have agreed that we should proceed with providing the necessary
support. Other development partners will also proceed on this basis. As you will see

from the note our support through the UNDP is subject to various conditions being met.

If you need any clarification, please get back to me.

Key issues arising from Irish Aid meeting with UNDP on Support to Local Government Elections in
Malawi:

Date: 9‘“ December 2010-12-09

Present: Richard Dictus, UN Resident Coordinator, Ram Shankar Deputy Resident Representative
UNDP, Dr. Vincent O’Neill, Head of Development Irish Aid and Padraig Quigley, Irish Aid.

Issues Discsused

Irish Aid outlined that the meeting was requested to clarify concerns arsing from the events of
Friday 3'“I December (where the Police and Army sealed off the offices of the MEC and
Commission staff and Commisioners were suspended) to consider options for the programming
of IA support for the LGE’s next April.

The RC outlined that he is still involved in discussions with Government and that the message he
is receiving is that Government still intends to hold the local government elections and are
requesting support of development partners to assist them in doing so. This commitment is
captured in the letter forwarded by the Chief Secretary earlier this week and will be re-
emphasised next week in the context of a briefing of HoIVIs by a Cabinet Minister.

The RC reiterated previous messages from Government that the decision to suspend MEC staff
was taken as result of the findings of an external audit report and a decision by Government that
further investigations including, a forensic audit, were required urgently. This can be interpreted
as a positive response by Government to the serious issues raised in the MEC audit.

UNDP indicated that donor funds would not be spent through the elections Trust Fund until
GoM follows up on the steps previously indicated (in the letter forwarded by the Minister of

Finance) and there is clarity about the outcome of the forensic audit to be completed, to
international standards, before mid-Jan 2011.

The RC shared that he has stressed with GoM on the need to ensure that key election activities
are not delayed further, if the elections are to take place as planned (or with a slight delay e.g.
moving from April to June). Of particular importance is the need to complete the registration
and nomination exercises so that ballot papers can be finalised and procured.

Despite the temporary suspension of the MEC, all of the UNDP TA will remain in place or
continue to arrive in forthcoming weeks, so that they are able to perform their tasks (when

either the MEC or any alternative arrangement that is put in place) to proceed with planning for
the LGE’s.

The RC still believes that GoM is committed to holding the LGE. The importance of an ongoing

constructive engagement with DPs and ensuring any support planned is directed in a well
coordinated manner was mutually appreciated.

 

 

Following consideration of options for support open to Irish Aid at this juncture, the following was

agreed:

0 lrish Aid will honour its commitment to support the Government of Malawi in holding
LGE’s in 2010 through support of the activities outlined in the PSD ~ and disburse
funding to UNDP in December 2010. This disbursement will be made ~ subject to the
following understanding with UNDP:

o UNDP will not disburse donor funds through the Trust Fund until the completion of ‘ M
the forensic audit in January 20111,- the assessment of, and satisfactory response to, (1,1,,,.ul§,i.laiig,p
measures raised in this Audit;\rmplementation of the measures communicated by  '
the Minister of Finance in response to the 2009 Audit and in joint agreement with
Irish Aid and other Development Partners supporting the PSD.

. o The content of the PSD may be amended, depending on how the situation (vis a vis
MEC and the forensic audit) unfolds over the coming weeks. For example, if the MEC
is not able to function or staff are implicated in fraud by the forensic audit, then it
may be necessary to bring in more TA (e.g.consultants, seconded staff from other
government departments, etc). Any such changes to the PSD would be made in
consultation with 60M and other Development Partners supporting the PSD.

o In the event that the Local Government Elections are cancelled, or where there
remain serious risks to the proper and transparent use of Irish Aid funding, there is
agreement that lrish Aid and UNDP, in 2011, will jointly agree how to reallocate
funds, earmarked for the LGE’s, to other activities relevant to strengthening
Democracy and Good Governance in Malawi.

0 It was agreed that lrish Aid would write to UNDP, documenting these areas of agreement, so

that UNDP can formally respond to confirm that this mutual understanding underpins the
. agreement to disburse funding forthe Local Government Elections PSD in December 2010.

GolVl follows up on the steps previously indicated (in the letter forwarded by the Minister of
Finance) and there is clarity about the outcome of the forensic audit to be completed, to
international standards, before mid-Jan 2011.

The RC shared that he has stressed with GoM on the need to ensure that key election activities
are not delayed further, if the elections are to take place as planned (or with a slight delay eg.
moving from April to June). Of particular importance is the need to complete the registration
and nomination exercises so that ballot papers can be finalised and procured.

Despite the temporary suspension of the MEC, all of the UNDP TA will remain in place or
continue to arrive in forthcoming weeks, so that they are able to perform their tasks (when

either the MEC or any alternative arrangement that is put in place) to proceed with planning for
the LGE’s,

The RC still believes that GoM is committed to holding the LGE. The importance of an ongoing
constructive engagement with DPs and ensuring any support planned is directed in a well
coordinated manner was mutually appreciated.

 

Following consideration of options for support open to Irish Aid at this juncture, the following was

agreed:
- Irish Aid will honour its commitment to support the Government of i'vlalawi in holding
LGE’s in 2010 through support of the activities outlined in the PSD --- and disburse
funding to UNDP in December 2010‘ This disbursement will be madtzsr —- subject to the
following understanding with UNDP:
o UNDP will not disburse donor funds through the Trust: Fund until the completion of _ u
the forensic audit in January 20 1; the assessment of, and satisfactory response to, QWeill/divas“in
measures raised in this Audit;\rmplementation of the measures communicated by """""""""""" " “J
the Minister of Finance in response to the 2009 Audit and in joint agreement: with
lrish Aid and other Development Partners supporting the PSD.
. o The content of the PSD may be amended, depending on how the situation (vis a vis

MEC and the forensic audit) unfolds over the coming weeks. For example, if the lvilEC
is not able to function or staff are implicated in fraud by the forensic: audit, then it
may be necessary to bring in more TA (egconsultants, seconded staff from other
government departments, etc). Any such changes to the PSD would be made in
consultation with 60M and other Development Partners supporting the PSD.

O

In the event that the Local Government Elections are cancelled, or" where there
remain serious risks to the proper and transparent use of lrish Aid funding, there is
agreement that Irish Aid and UNDP, in 2011, will jointly agree how to reallocate
funds, earmarked for the LGE’s, to other activities relevant to strengthening
Democracy and Good Governance in Malawi.

0 it was agreed that lrish Aid would write to UNDP, documenting these areas of agreement, so
that UNDP can formally respond to confirm that this mutual understanding underpins the
. agreement to disburse funding for the Local Government Elections PSD in December 2010

1.0 SETUATION ANALYSIS

1.1 Background

Malawi has min”. signif'wni progress towards consolidating; its participatory democratic practice since
introduction of multi‘party elections in 199-7». The country has held four successive parliamentary and
presidential elections. The 2009 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections (PPE) have been acclaimed as

‘ free, credible and reflective of the will of tne electorate according; to international standards. The
national constitution provides for a system of checks and balances among the legislature, the executive
and the judiciary and for universally recognized pillars of democracy, including a bill of rights and freedom
of speech and assembly. The Malawi Constitution also provides for the Local Government Elections IILG‘El
to be conducted one year after the parliamentary and Presidential Elections.

in 2000, Malawians went to the polls to elect their first local government councils with a view to
empowering local communities. This resulted in the establishment oi 861 local government: councils
which held office, in accordance with the Local Government Ac: (1098.), for five years until 2005. The
momentum was not sustained, and no local government elections have been held since. . Voter turnout
at the 2000 local government elections was a paltry 14%. Ptirther, 15% of constituencies had only one
candidate standing for election in terms of gender representation, or; of the 8.43; elected councillors, only
70 or 8.3 % of the elected councilors were women. Following a constitutional change and further
legislative changes that allow the President to set the dates for the LGE and that have changed the scope
and composition of the local level bodies, the government has expressed desire to hold the LEE on 2.3;
November 2010. According to the Electoral Commission Amendment Bill 2010, there will be a total of 439
local government wards for the 2010 elections which will be more than doohle the number ol’
parliamentary constituencies.

The 2009 WE i V  aied the strengths that hat. enabled MEC. which bears the constitutional responsibility
for the conduct  elc:-.:‘.ions, to deliver free anc- t..‘edi'oie elections. Henri-ever the subsequent evaluation oi"
the Elections Support Project,» the repent; of the Hi observer mission and the illectoral Debrieling
Conference on lire "2009', revealed that tnere were institutional weaknesses that would need tr.» be
addressed in order to further enhance the quality of its work. Sonic of the major weaknesses included
poor planning and budgeting resulting into poor planning and budgeting which resulted into unwarranted
cost overruns; delayed procurement of equipment that resulted into the procurement of more items to
meet the Constitutional deadline of 19th May, 2009; weal: institutional capacity at MEC in most the
department resulting into deployment of Was in almost every department; and inadequate capacity of the
C50 in the implementation of CVE activities.

According to reports compiled by technical experts after the elections, and " 5 confirmed by the findings
of the DPA IUNDP needs assessment mission (NAM} ﬁelded over a period oi two weeks in March 2010,
these weaknesses included a voters roll with errors and no regular and systematic updating, of the
register, insufficient information for voters, party agents and domestic observers at polling stations,
inadequate training of voter registration teams and poll workers resciting; in poor completion of Optical
Map Reading (OMR) forms, a high percentage (60%) of unservlceable field registration equipment which
broke down due to poor handling by registration staff, lack of counterpart staff to understudy technical
expertsand no agreed methodology for evaluation of Civil Socrety Organizations" lCSOsl capacities to
conduct civic education. Consultations cmducted by the Dl‘A/UNDP‘ NAM also revealed a general lack of
urgency at ME: to prepare for the impending iocal government elections. The Commission appeared t
be more reactive trﬂn proactive and had no detailed, actionable calendar on the basis on which
prepare for the 1-, tions upon announcementnfthe polling day. .

1.2 Rationale
While the Commission has the required competence to conduct. elections, a fact but

Li

"' out oy its
organization of , revious elections since 1994, the last LGE were held in 32000 and there is scanty
institutional memory to bolster the Commission’s ability. Additionally, the population has little
understanding of the real roles and functions of the councilors to be elected this time around, especially
with the amendments that are being introduced to the Local Act. in the wake of the 2009. PPE, it is
conceivable that voters may not be as enthusiastic as they should to once more  to polling, stations to
cast their votes — a phenomenon that plagued the 200C) LGE. Thus, a strong effort will need to be made to
put in place a voter education program that will sufficiently explain the functions. of the counciiors, the
importance of voting for women as well as men to ensure a healthy and gender sensitive voter turnout.
This will be particularly important in view of the changes in the structure of the electorate since the last
local government elections of 2000 and the import of the recent amendments to the constitution and the
Local Government Act. if voters are not motivated to participate in the elections, the resulting, low
turnout can prompt questions of legitimacy, representation and accountability of elected leaders and
institutions.

 

Following on the success of the 2009 PPE, the forthcoming LGE must succeed not only by meeting the
conventional criteria of free and credible elections, but also in mohilizing a healthy turnout: of voters,
increasing the participation of women candidates and regiStering an increase in the numbers of female
councilors. »’—‘. cruci l lecture of the elections will be the extent of non-partisan involvement of the media
and civil society org: " 'zi‘tlons in civic and voter education to enable voters to maize informed choices, as
well as monitoring; media reporting on the elections for equitable and non partisan coverage. of political
partv campaigns .i‘e cornuct of the election; also needs to reflect improved performance on the part of
ME: relative to weaknesses perceived in past election: especially in the availability of an updated voters
register. Most importantly, lii‘iEC's performance will need to induc renewed public confidence in the
Commission as a coz'npetent and impartial institution to facilitate free choices by communil
councilors who will plan, formulate and implement their development plans.

' 2.0 INTERVENTKJN STRATEGY
The envisaged support to the elections, to be funded through a trust fund that will be established by
UNDP for the purpose,» will be a fast—track intervention that, while not addressing all of" the perceived
weaknesses within the MEC, will nevertheless focus on enabling it: to deliver a credible election and
thereby take thecountry another step forward in deepening Malawi democratic tradition.

The strategy envisages a three-pronged intervention that will, firstly, offer support to MEL” in the form of
voter registration equipment and printing of ballot papers as well as recruitment of technical assistance
staff. Secondly, the project will also provide limited technical assistance through provision to the Malawi
Electoral Commission so that it is able to engage CSOs. Through this component, MEC will need to worl:
strongly with ongoing civic education organizations and mechanisms such as NlCE, which through
separate channels may obtain increased resources for purpose of Lip-scaling activities for the LEE. It will
also focus on promoting voter education through C505, While all aspects of voter information (basic
information on the fundamentals of the elections including when and where to register,- and where, when
and how to vote}, w": Lie the responsibility of MEC. The Ministry of Gender, Children and Community
Development will n rat a 50—50 campaign, in continuation of the successful ca npaign for the 2009 WE,
to sensitize the ;_ eral pis'olic about the importance of voting for female councilors.

     

  

 

 

UNDP will continueits coordination role for support to the project through regular, monthly meetings
with Development lf'artners and Officials of the MEC to ensure project monitoring, evaluating the impact
of activities undertaken, and identifying opportunities for improved performance.

Development Partners including UNDP, on acrivities undertaken. Both the media and the (1505 will play a
proactive advocacy role to conduct voter education, encourage healthy voter turnout, mobilize newly
eligible voters to register and promote voluntary affirmative action by political parties to sponsor
increased nomination criwomen candidates.
