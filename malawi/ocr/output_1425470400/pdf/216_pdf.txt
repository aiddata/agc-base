1. RATION ALE

1.] Economic and social situation

Malawi has a population of approximately 13 million of which 52.4 % live below the poverty
line and 22.4 % are classiﬁed as ‘ultra-poor’ meaning that they are unable to meet their basic
needsz. It ranks 164 out of 177 countries on the 2007/8 Human Development Index with an
annual GDP per capita of US$ 265. Malawi covers an area of 118 500 km2 and is one of the
most densely populated countries in sub-Saharan Africa with average land holding of 0.8 of a

hectare per household. Approximate

1y 88 % of the population live in rural areas and the

majority of them depend heavily on the natural resources base for their livelihoods.

Maize surpluses in the past three years, due to favourable rains and the GoM/donor input

subsidy scheme, have helped raise real
8% over the past three years, a record

GDP from 2.1% in 2005 to an average of approximately
for Malawi. In addition, both inﬂation and interest rates

have decreased signiﬁcantly over the past three years. These improvements in the macro
economic situation are expected to have a positive impact on private sector investment and

growth.

However, notwithstanding the remarkable progress of the last few years, Malawi’s economy
remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, such as the recent spike in oil and fertiliser prices.
The very recent deterioration in terms of trade is in the order of 4% of GDP (or approximately

USD 160 million) with a very negative

ennium Development Goals (MDGs) issued prior to the

recent oil and fertilizer shocks, suggested that poverty had recently decreased from to 52.4 % to
45 % meaning that Malawi had been on track to achieve the MDG 1 target. Progress on other

MDGs was mixed.

1.2 Sector context

Malawi’s overarching policy document is the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS), a second generation PRSP which was adopted in 2006, which seeks to transform
Malawi from a “predominately importing and consuming country to at producing and exporting
nation”. It has a very high level of national ownership and commitment. The MGDS recognises
that agriculture is not only the backbone of Malawi’s economy but also an essential part of its
social fabric, accounting for about 36% of GDP; 90% of foreign exchange earnings (tobacco

65%, sugar 11% and tea 10%) and empl

At a sectoral level Malawi has both 3

oying 87% of the population.

Food Security Policy and a Nutrition Security Policy
5 coordinated through the Joint Task Force on Food and

Nutrition Security. More recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MoAFS) and
donors have draﬁed the Agricultural Development Programme (ADP), which serves as both a

prioritisation of activities as well as an

investment framework for both GoM and donors. The

ADP is derived, in part, from a synthesized hierarchy of existing agriculture related policies and
acts called the National Agricultural Policy Framework. The ADP is also in line with the
AU/NEPAD Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP). It has 3
main pillars; food security; agribusiness; and natural resources management; as well as
components on; technology dissemination; institutional strengthening and capacity building;
and cross cutting issues (gender, HIV/AIDS). While the ADP is expected to be ofﬁcially
adopted by the GoM shortly, the World Bank and Norway have already pledged support for the
programme. The objectives, activities and the monitoring system of FlDP phase II are fully

aligned to the ADP. It should be noted that FIDP I has contributed signiﬁcantly to the drafting
of the ADP.

More than 89% of households in Malawi depend on income derived, wholly or in part, from the
exploitation of the natural resource base however Malawi’s natural resources continue to be
degraded. This degradation implies negative consequences on future household incomes unless
it is addressed. Agricultural productivity is generally low, primarily due to dependence on rain-
fed agriculture, declining soil fertility, and a lack of inputs. The majority of smallholders
practice subsistence agriculture rather than considering farming as a business. The status quo is
exacerbated by weak links to markets and limited access to extension services, land and credit.

In addition, despite three consecutive years of national food security - due to the GoM input
subsidy programme and good rainfall - Malawi had previously suffered cyclical food crises over
the past decade. Even in years of national food security, many households have insufﬁcient food
to feed themselves during the annual ‘lean period’ (December - March), which is exacerbated
due to signiﬁcant post harvest losses, leading to a worsening malnutrition situation and the
adoption of unsustainable coping strategies.

FIDP phase H (F IDP II) is an integrated programme that seeks to continue to address a number
of these serious problems. These are i) to halt and reverse the decline of the natural resource
base; ii) to reduce post harvest losses and increase agro-processing; iii) to diversify and increase
agricultural production; iv) to promote income generation through agri-business initiatives. By
increasing productivity and producing greater value from agriculture F [DP will help to change
smallholder farmers’ perspectives so that they consider farming as a business activity rather
than solely as a means of subsistence.

Lessons learnt and complementarity

The EC has considerable experience in the sector in Malawi. FIDP is the latest in a sequence of
GoM / EU programmes stretching back over 20 years3. FIDP has been subjected to a number of
reviews including ROMS (2005; 2006) and a MTR of phase I in 2008. The overriding message
is that FIDP is currently the most successful4 agriculture programme in Malawi and F11)? is

considered a ‘brand name’ signifying high quality. Nevertheless, phase II will incorporate 5 key
lessons learnt:

1. Greater emphasis on suitable business skills training, particularly at village level, and that
this should be done through partnerships with other stakeholders (private sector, NGOs and
farmer organisations) and not solely through government systems which, by their very
nature, are not well suited for delivering such messages.

2. Encourage a demand driven extension service which includes GoM but also other
stakeholders. Training in good agricultural practices (GAP) should be conducted in a
coherent manner at various institutions at national, regional and local levels in order to
speed up the uptake of key extension messages and dissemination of best agricultural
practices. Training will be coordinated by GoM but will also draw on private sector, NGOs
and farmer organisations for implementation. Lead fanners‘ can be recruited as in situ
extension ofﬁcers.

3. The need for FIDP to adopt a more systematic approach that builds activities in a modular
manner with increasing complexity as communities acquire greater capacities. That is,
starting with simpler activities such as natural resource management before attempting agri~
business initiatives. FIDP should clearly deﬁne to communities at the outset what activities

 

FlDP builds on previous GoM/EU funded programmes such as ADDFOOD, PAPPA and PROSCARP
which achieved notable success in the areas of soil conservation and water management. FIDP continues
to include soil and water management but is signiﬁcantly wider in scope. _
All three reviews gave FIDP a mixture of A (excellent) and B (good) grades when measuring the preject
against the ﬁve OECD assessment criteria.

FIDP will support and for how long under each module. In addition, FIDP II should focus

on ‘core activities’ and not over extend itself by dealing with issues such as international
trade. '

4. Given that FIDP is trusted and capable to deliver complex agricultural messages it should
also be used in order to help the wider development agenda by acting as a conduit for

important messages on hygiene, sanitation, nutrition and cross cutting issues.

5. And lastly, it is important to clarify and formalise linkages with other programmes and
development actors. These include infrastructure projects ~ particularl I feeder roads and

building market structures — but also access to micro credit and inputs (GoM / donor Inputs
Subsidy Programme -ISP).

Other lessons learnt include the need for a strong M and E component that is fully aligned to the
GoM own systems; the need for key GoM project staff to have a rigorous knowledge of EDP
procedures; and that despite consensus on the need for a sector policy, the project approach

continues to be important in building capacities of GoM staff in financial and project
management.

There are a number of EC/EU funded complementary actions. The largest programme in
Malawi, which accounts for 14% of annual government spending and in 2008/9 cost
approximately 230 million USD, is the GoM Input Subsidy Programme (ISP) which is
composed of two components; fertilizer and seed. The former is funded by the GoM budget and
budget support donors (CABS group) including the EU. The latter is funded by DFID, Norway,
Ireland and the EC (Food Security Budget Line ~ € 2 million in 2008).

EC Sugar Accompanying Measures (6 10.578 million). Malawi has a clear global comparative
advantage in sugar production and the funds are being used to expand irrigated out grower sugar
cane production in order to both reduce poverty and increase sugar production.

The Institutional Development across the Agri-Food sector - IDAF (9 ACP MAI I9 - E 7.9
million) main objectives are to strengthen value chains in the sector and assist institutional
reform of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MoAFS). Despite problems in

implementation recent work on value chain analysis and core function analysis will help feed
FIDP II. '

Improved Forest Management Sustainable Livelihoods Phase I- IFMSL (9 ACP MAI 15- € .9
million) has drawn up co-management plans between forest based communities and the
Department of Forestry which will be fully implemented under phase II. In a number of cases
IFMSL project areas protect the catchment areas of FIDP irrigation schemes.

In 2008 a new FMO for balances of Stabex was signed (6 6 million). Activities include legume

seed multiplication, the expansion of Dwangwa sugar cane out growers scheme and support to

the production and marketing of cassava, which will be implemented through the FIDP
structure.

Other relevant GoM/ EU programmes include the Rural Feeder Roads Programme (9 ACP MAI
29 - € 15 million) and the Capacity Building of NSA (9 ACP MAI 28 - € 5 million). At the end
of 2008 an identiﬁcation study was contracted for the programming of the 10th EDP 6 80
million Community Based Activities and Small Scale Irrigation Programme and the E 15
million Capacity Building Programme for the agriculture sector. Both will be designed to
dovetail with FIDP phase II. Other donor projects include the World Bank / Norwegian ADP

support programme (15 million USD) and the WB / IFAD Rural Livelihoods and Irrigation
Project — IRLAD (40 million USD).

Donor coordination

donors in Malawi with the EU taking a leading in agriculture and infrastructure and other MS

focusing on social sectors. The EC is the largest donor in the agricultural sector and is
prominent in guiding sector dialogue in agricultural and food security in MalaWI, which 15 at an
advanced level of information sharing and coordination. Structures are in place to facilitate both
donor-donor coordination, through the Donor Committee on Agriculture and Food Secunty
(DCAF S) which the EC currently chairs, as well as donor-GoM coordination.

While 60M and donors remain committed towards the adoption of a sectoral policy (ADP),
both 60M and donors remain hesitant to move towards a sector budget support modality due to
the inherent risks involved. Nevertheless, there is a clear need for greater donor harmonisation
through a more proactive donor coordination in line with the Paris Declaration. At the end 'of
2008 the BC, the current chair of the Donor Committee on Agriculture and Food Security
(DCAFS), made a number of proposals which have been endorsed by other donors, including
the adoption of a strategic plan for donor harmonisation with annual targets linked to the Global
Donor Platform, the adoption of a institutional mechanism for streamlining funding and TA
requests from GoM, and the recruitment of a full time GoM-donor coordinator to ensure follow

up.

DESCRIPTION

FIDP phase Il‘(FIDP II) is an integrated development programme that seeks to continue to
address, a number of these serious problems. These are i) to halt and reverse the decline of the
natural resource base; ii) to reduce post harvest losses and increase agro-processing; iii) to
diversify and increase agricultural production; iv) to promote income generation through agri-
business initiatives. By increasing productivity and producing greater value from agriculture
FIDP will help to change smallholder farmers’ perspectives so that they consider farming as a
business activity rather than solely as a means of subsistence.

While FIDP is demand driven, in that communities must want to join FIDP (although they are
required to meet certain minimum criteria) and can choose which activies within certain
constraints, FIDP is targeted at the more productive smaller holder framers, see attachment 7.
Beneﬁciaries are not paid in order to undertake activities, as in safety net programmes, but
instead contribute their labour and time in return for the beneﬁts the programme will bring.

For ease of reference an initial logical framework is attached. It may be updated or adapted in
the Overall Work Plan, to which it will be annexed, without this necessarily requiring an
amendment to the ﬁnancing agreement.

Objectives

The overall objective of FIDP phase II is to: “To contribute to the reduction of poverty in
Malawi", while the project purpose is: "To improve the livelihoods of rural households through

the conservation of natural resources, diversification of agricultural production and increased
agri—busz’ness. ”

Expected results

FIDP activities are expected to achieve two types of results, the ﬁrst set of results (1-4) are the
more tangible and quantiﬁable results expected in the ﬁeld; while the second set of results (5-7)
are more qualitative results relating to community development and empowerment.

Result 1 Natural resources are managed sustainably. More than 89% of households

depend on income derived, wholly or in part, from the exploitation of the
natural resource base - be it through farming, fishing or other activities yet
Malawi’s environment continues to be degraded. This degradation implies

Result 4

negative consequences on future household incomes unless it is addressed.
FIDP phase II will continue and expand activities in order to halt soil erosion.
improve soil fertility and encourage water harvesting.

Post harvest storage and processing is improved. Post harvest losses are
estimated by the GoM to be up to 30% of total production. Effective storage of
foodstuffs is therefore essential in Malawi, which has suffered cyclical food
insecurity over the past decade at high economic and social cost. Storage is
equally important when surpluses are produced, such as in the past three years.
A lack of adequate storage facilities means that farmers often sell produce at
harvest time when prices tend to be at their lowest. Improving storage and post
harvest processing will help to reduce food insecurity and increase income
generation (creating new markets for processed foods). It will also help to
stimulate village grain banks and warehouse receipting systems that can give
smallholders access to credit without jeopardising their own food security.

Smallholder agriculture productivity is increased and diversified.
Traditionally maize is the main food crop and tobacco the main cash crop. Over
reliance on maize has exacerbated the chronic malnutrition while tobacco prices
have ﬂuctuated widely in the recent past. Neither are suited to be grown in all
parts of the country and better returns can be made from diversifying
agricultural production to other crops, livestock or aquaculture.

Agri-business is promoted. The main revolution that FIDP has started is
changing small holders’ perception of farming as a means of subsistence to
viewing farming as a business activity. The promotion of agri-business

activities through the formation of groups, clubs and groups will be continued
and formalised.

As an integrated programme FIDP includes a number of cross cutting activities that are essential

for the achievement of the four ﬁeld results liste
own right. These results have been explicitly included in order to gi
and to ensure that they are monitored during implementation.

Capacities of FIDP communities, the MoAFS and other stakeholders are
improved. FIDP will support capacity building at all levels, where possible,
jointly with other donors. Capacity building of groups and communities will
take place through both formal (courses) and day-to-day implementation. FIDP
II will re-establish a network of training institutions at national, regional and
district level. Training will be organised by GoM but delivered through
partnerships with the private sector, farmer organisations, research and
academic institutions. FIDP groups and communities will be categorised into

league tables based on results achieved with awarding of prizes (in kind) as
incentives. '

Activity4 Promoting agri-business and teach smallholder farmers to view farming as a
business activity. It will support farmers through training, and learning-by—
doing, on basic business principles (cost beneﬁt analysis, proﬁt margin analysis
etc). FIDP II staff (paid under PE) will include a number of agri-business
experts (for example lectures from Bunda College) to form a number of small
teams of 2-3 persons each of which will spend approximately 5 days in each
FIDP community taking groups and communities through basic business
concepts. The training programme will be developed in coordinated with the
TA agribusiness expert. The promotion of agri-business activities through the
formation of groups, clubs and groups will be continued and formalised (formal
legal status, accounting, registration with GoM and compliance with health and

safety). Successful agri-businesses will be encouraged to consider forward and
backward linkages. r

The three cross cutting activities that are linked to the four ﬁeld activities are:

Activitys Building capacities of FIDP communities, the MoAFS and other
stakeholders are improved. Activities will include supporting degree and
other relevant courses for GOM and NSA staf . Training will include production
and management including planning, project management, ﬁnancial
management and internal control. In addition, FIDP ll will support the
rehabilitation and operation of agricultural training structures at national,

regional and district level. These structures will operate in a coherent and
uniﬁed manner.

Activity6 Enhancing the social development of FIDP communities. Activities will

Activity7 Coordinating and managing and knowledge. Activities will include
supporting the production and dissemination of information on crop storage,

agricultural production, post harvest losses, ﬁeld farm trials and GAP under
FIDP.

The same action can be undertaken under different activities, for example tree planting can be
done under natural resource management in order to bind soil, reduce soil erosion and to
regulate water flow. Planting of (fruit) trees can also be done as part of diversiﬁcation.
Similarly, keeping chickens can be a diversiﬁcation activity if done on a small scale and for
one’s own consumption, where as if it is done on a larger scale with the primary motivation to
generate income, then it is considered an agri-business activity.

Attachment 4 not only shows the progression from one activity level to another but also that the
main actors and drivers will change as progression occurs. For example, natural resources
management is generally undertaken by groups and supported by government whereas agri-

business is undertaken by smaller groups or even individuals and the main driver is the public
sector.

The main components and speciﬁc commitments of the programme are:

(a) A series of four programme estimates to support the above activities and the operating costs.
(b) A service contract for long term Technical Assistance for approximately 54 months

(c) A number of grants to be awarded following a Call For Proposal.

((1) An international supply contract for vehicles and supplies needed.

(6) A series of FWC contracts for audit and evaluation.

 

The timing of the various modalities (programme estimates, service contracts, grants etc) for
implementing the major components of the programme is given in attachment 2.

 

Malawi is divided into three regions (north, centre and south) and 28 districts each of which is
divided into 3-6 extension planning areas (EPAs). FIDP II will operate in the same 11 districts

- Northern region (4): Chitipa, Karonga, Mzimba, and Rumphi
- Central region (4); Lilongwe, Salima, Nkhokakota, and Dowa

However, FIDP I did not operate in all EPAs in each of the above eleven districts. FIDP II will
seek to expand and consolidate FIDP’s presence in the current eleven districts by operating
(subject to demand) in more villages in the EPAs that it is currently working in, and where
feasible, more EPAs within the current 11 districts. In addition, the award of grants may further
expend the geographic range of FIDP by including additional districts.

The FIDP central management team, including the TA, will continue to be located in Lilongwe.
FIDP will continue to have a programme coordinator and project accountant in each of the
District Agriculture Development Ofﬁces (DADOs). In addition, small teams of FlDP agri—
business staff will spend signiﬁcant time in FIDP villages throughout Malawi.
