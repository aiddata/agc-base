Dear Dr. O’Neill

Application for Continued Support to NASFAM:
Promoting Conservation Agriculture in Smallholder Farming Systems 2009110

We wish to thank lrish Aid for the support it has offered during the past year, which
enabled NASFAM to pilot the integration of Conservation Agriculture in its work. The
assistance provided was both timely and invaluable and has brought important
results which necessitate an expansion of the programme.

We have therefore developed a five year programme for promoting selected
conservation agriculture techniques and sustainable crop production practices in
smallholder farming systems, which is described in the attached documents.

Although the programme covers a five year period, we are writing at this time to seek
support from Irish Aid for the activities of the first year only. The attached proposal,
logframe, workplan and budget describe these activities, which are planned for
NASFAlVl‘s financial year commencing October 2009. In total, NASFAM is seeking a

financial assistance from lrish Aid of €250,000.

We trust that the dialogue between the Embassy and ourselves prior to this formal

submission will have ironed out any major issues. However, we will be pleased to
clarify any further areas necessary.

We are hopeful this proposal will meet your favourable consideration and thank you
for your support.

Yours sincerely
