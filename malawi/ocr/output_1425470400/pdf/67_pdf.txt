1.1 Economic and social situation

Malawi has a population of approximately 13.2 million of which 52.4% live below the poverty line
and 22.4% are classiﬁed as ‘ultra-poor’ meaning that they are unable to meet their basic needs]. It
ranks 164 out of 177 counties on the 2007/8 Human Development Index with an annual GDP per
capita of US$ 265. Malawi covers an area of 118 500 km2 and is one of the most densely populated
countries in sub-Saharan Africa with average land holding of 0.8 of a hectare per household.
Approximately 88% of the population live in rural areas and the majority of them depend heavily
on the natural resources base for their livelihoods.

Agriculture is not only the backbone of Malawi’s economy but also an essential part of its social
fabric, accounting for about 36% 'of GDP; more than 80% of foreign exchange earning (tobacco
60%, sugar 11% and tea 10%) and employing about 80% of the population.

Large maize surpluses in past three years, due to favourable rains and the GoM/donor input
subsidy scheme, ‘have raised real GDP growth from an average of 2% in previous years to 7.9%
and 7.4% in 2006 and 2007 respectivelyz. A sound macro economic situation has seen inﬂation
and interest rates fall signiﬁcantly while exchange rates and foreign exchange reserves have
remained stable. In 2006 Malawi achieved HIPC completion. In 2007 the BIB made 6 30 million
available for an investment facility for on-loaning to small and medium business. These
improvements in the macro economic situation are expected to have a positive impact on private
sector investment.

 

However, notwithstanding the remarkable progress of the last few years, Malawi’s economy
remains highly vulnerable to external'shocks such as the recent escalating oil and fertiliser prices.
The very recent deterioration in terms of trade is in the order of 4% of GDP (or approximately
USD 160 million) with a very negative impact on foreign exchange reserves.

A GoM report on progress on the Millennium DeVelopment Goals (MDGs) issued prior to the
recent oil and fertilizer shocks, suggested that poverty had recently decreased from to 52.4% to
45% meaning that Malawi had been on track to achieve the MDG 1 target. Progress on other
MGDS was mixed.

1.2 Sector context

Malawi ’s development and sugar policies

 

Malawi’s overarching policy document is the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS),
a second generation PRSP which was adopted in 2006. It has a very high level of national
ownership and commitment. The MGDS highlights sugar as one of three core sub sectors in terms
of revenue, GDP, employment and foreign exchange earnings and looks to maximise the
performance of the sugar Sector in the short to medium term.

The EU sugar reform has an impact on the world sugar market and requires ACP sugar
producers to realign their strategy of exporting sugar to the EU. Studies have identiﬁed
Malawi as one of the sugar producers with good prospects for competing on the EU sugar
market given its low production costs, excellent cane growing'conditions and abundant
water and land resources.

 

' Malawi Growth and Development Strategy, MGDS, 2005.

2 Malawi IMF Country Report (January 2008): The Malawi authorities recently revised the historical GDP estimates to better reﬂect
the informal sector. As result, GDP in 2006 was increased by over 40%. Annual real GDP growth for 2006 was revised to 7.9% on
the basis of the revisions to the national accounts (it would have been 85% under the old series).

, the measures outlined in the NAS. The EC Multi Annual Support

tion and programming of the Annual Action Programmes (AAPs).
*0 main objectives, which are:

a) Strengthening and dr loping out growers schemes
b) Support for rural infri ructure development

The AAP 2008 is the third in a series of annual actions and builds on activities already approved in
the 2006 and 2007 Accompanying Measures.

The strengths and weaknesses of the sugar sector

Sugar is the second highest foreign exchange earner in Malawi at around 1 1%; it contributes 5-6%
of GDP; 1% to government revenues; employs 14,500 workers directly and supports around
120,000 people indirectly.

Malawi is considered a potential world-class producer of sugar with excellent cane growing
conditions and abundant water and land resources. Malawi’s industry is one of the most efﬁcient in
the world. This is in spite of the fact that some of Malawi’s comparative advantage is eroded by
the fact that it is landlocked, with transport adding an extra 3-4 cents per lb to the farm gate price
of 7 cents per lb. Nevertheless, Malawi remains low cost and proﬁtable at current world prices.
Malawi also has a reputation for high quality sugar and is known for its speciality sugars.
Furthermore, the Nchalo mill is fair trade certiﬁed.

Malawi beneﬁts from numerous markets for its sugar. Unlike many other sugar protocol countries,
Malawi is not highly dependent on the EU market, to which it only exports around 16%, meaning
that is less exposed to the elimination of preferential prices under the sugar reform. At present the
majority — 57% — is for domestic consumption. A further 19% is exported to the regional market —
mainly Kenya and Tanzania — who despite being sugar producers are net importers of sugar.

There is a high degree of consensus that the reform of the EU sugar regime presents Malawi - like
neighbouring Zambia— with very signiﬁcant opportunities to increase their sugar exports to the
EU under the Everything But Arms (EBA) agreement. The expansion of the sugar sector in
Malawi, which often links the private sector with out growers, can be used as a model for
achieving poverty alleviation by linking trade to development. In addition, there is the potential of
further increasing the use of sugar by-products, for example, in the production of ethanol.

Potential in the sector is compromised by a number of factors. Sugar needs to be grown under
irrigation in Malawi, meaning that any expansion is capital intensive with high initial investments.
Past interest rates over 40% and the heavy devaluation of the Kwacha has meant that commercial
loans have been costly. This coupled, with the lack of availability of soft loans has limited
investment and expansion of the sector and in certain cases, such as Kasinthula, lead to the
accumulation of signiﬁcant debts. In addition, limited access to credit at individual and
cooperative level has hindered access to inputs and funds for replanting cane, both which have
negatively impacted on productivity. This is exacerbated by a lack of skilled personnel both at
ﬁeld and management level.

Threats to the sector are less tangible, but exist nevertheless. Clearly government macro-economic
policy is important. In addition, the dominance of Illovo in the Malawian sugar sector, which owns
both mills, creates dependency on a single company. World prices for sugar have proved to be
highly volatile and difﬁcult to predict, due to the fact that sugar is largely traded through futures
and trade agreements, although there is consensus that in the short to medium term prices would
rise to around 15 cents per lb. And lastly, there is a need for transparency and accountability
between the various stakeholders in the sector in order to avoid misunderstanding and the
perception that out growers are being exploited.

Due to the current land ownership, any expansion of sugar production in Malawi is likely to be on
Traditional Authority land and hence involve out growers’ schemes. The advantage of out
growers’ schemes is that, by including small holder farmers, they are able to contribute to poverty
reduction more effectively than estate production. However, out growers’ schemes are more
complex organisations, bringing together hundreds of individual farmers, and hence require a
higher degree of organisational management, often in the form of Trusts.

There are currently few incentives for establishing new out growers schemes, despite the
underlying proﬁtability. Making grant funding available will facilitate the expansion of existing
schemes and/or the creation of new schemes.

 

Recent developments

I In September 2006 Illovo was purchased by Associated British Foods. Due to this, and their
conﬁdence in the opportunities opened up by having unlimited access to the EU market, Illovo has
brought forward their post-2012 expansion plans in order that they be completed by 2011 or
I earlier. The plans include investing around 6 60 million in increasing the crushing capacity of the
Nchalo factory from 313 MT per hour to 385 MT, increasing the amount of raw cane required
from 1.414 million tonnes to 1.754 million tons. This increased demand of 340,000 MT of cane
I requires that a further 3,300 hectares of land be converted to sugar cane. It is expected that 700
hectares will come from estates while the remaining 2,600 hectares will be from out grower
schemes, such as the 550 hectare Kasinthula phase III expansion, funded under the 2007 Sugar
I Accompanying Measures. Over the next ten years Illovo has further plans to expand the capacity
of the Nchalo mill creating the demand for an additional 7,000 hectares. While over the next 3-5
I years increased capacity at Dwangwa will require an additional 2,500 hectares of sugar cane.

The African Development Bank (AFDB) have recently renewed their interest in sugar in Malawi.
They now have an ofﬁce in the country and have indicated their intention to invest a further 30
million USD in the sugar sector. The AFDB and EC are currently conducting a joint feasibility
study for the expansion of the Dwangwa out grower scheme.

 

1.3 Lessons learnt and complementarity

Given the recent nature of EC funding to sugar in Malawi (only since 2007) there have been no
reviews or monitoring as yet. However, experience has underlined the importance of having strong
organisational set up in out growers’ schemes and a balance of both farmer and professional
representation on the Board of Trustees. The EC has substantial experience in the area of rural
development, agricultural and food security in Malawi with this being a focal sector under both the
9th and 10'h EDF.

Lessons can also be drawn from the implementation of STABEX projects, which have mainly
focused on the tea and coffee sectors. EU support has assisted in increasing the proﬁtability of both
smallholders and estates by introducing higher yielding and better quality varieties. In turn, this
has helped to increase diversiﬁcation by smallholders, leading to higher production and increased
incomes in these areas.

To date Malawi has received 6 5,667,000 under the Accompanying Measures in 2006 (€ 667,000)
and 2007 (€ 5,000,000). These funds are being used for: a series of studies (€ 267,000); capacity
building at both farmer and management level (€ 2,400,000); a phase III expansion of the
Kasinthula out growers' scheme in Nchalo (€ 2,550,000) and improving feeder roads at the
Dwangwa out growers' scheme (6 350,000).

The EC is currently undertaking a mapping and soil survey of the area around Dwangwa as the
ﬁrst part in a joint feasibility study for the expansion of Dwangwa together with the African
Development Bank (AFDB). The recent increase in the processing capacity of the Dwangwa sugar
mill has meant that another 1,300 ha of cane can be planted over the next 24 months. The AFDB
currently has sufﬁcient funding for 700 hectares while it is envisaged that the EU will fund the
remaining 600 ha using 6 3,000,000 from STABEX balances which need to be committed before
the end of 2008. The AFDB are looking to increase investment in sugar by a further USD 30
million.

Activities under sugar link well with both the GoM / EU Farm Income Diversiﬁcation Programme
(FIDP — 9 ACP MAI 15, € 16.2 million) and the Institutional Development across the Agri—Food
Programme (IDAF — 9 ACP MAI 19, 6 7.9 million).

 

1.4 Donor coordination

The EC is the largest donor in the agricultural sector and is prominent in guiding sector dialogue in
agricultural and food security in Malawi, which is at an advanced level of information sharing and
coordination. Structures are in place to facilitate both donor-donor coordination, through the Donor
Committee on Agriculture and Food Security (DCAFS), as well as donor-00M coordination. The
Sugar Steering Committee is very active and includes both the AFDB and the EC as the main
donors in the sector but is also attended on ad hoc basis by other donors.

2. DESCRIPTION

The 2008 Sugar Action Plan is the third in a series of annual actions to support the implementation
of the National Adaptation Strategy for Malawi (NAS), the EC Support Strategy for Malawi 2006-
2013, and the Multi annual Indicative Programme (MIP) 2007-2010. It builds on activities
approved in the 2006 and 2007 Accompanying Measures.

 

Given that sugar is one of the most proﬁtable smallholder crops grown in Malawi, the project

consists of a single action; launching a Call for Proposals for the creation of new and/or expansion '
of existing out grower schemes. A ‘scoping study’ for this Call for Proposals (CfP) in order to

raise awareness and better target the CfP is currently ongoing and preliminary results have already

identiﬁed potential beneﬁciaries at two different levels. This study, which will be completed at the

beginning of 2009 will help in ﬁnalising the Cﬂ’ Guidelines and facilitate organising 2 speciﬁc

events planned (one in Malawi and the other in South Africa) to raise awareness and attract

potential investors/applicants.

For ease of reference an initial logical framework is attached. It may be updated or adapted in the
Overall Work Plan, to which it will be annexed, without this necessarily requiring an amendment
to the ﬁnancing agreement.

2.1 Objectives

Overall Objective: To contribute to supporting the effective implementation of the GoM’s
NAS for sugar with a poverty reduction focus.

The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the implementation of the COM National
Adaptation Strategy (NAS) for sugar. However, while the NAS considers the whole stigar value
chain, including processing, EC supported activities focus on areas which have a clear poverty
reduction potential. One such area is the expansion and/or creation of new sugar cane out grower

the scale of 1. wt of E V/AIDS in Southern African, the Delegation has recently drawn up
guidelines for _  to ma..:stream HIV/AIDS in agriculture projects. The guidelines and actions
are to be imple; :d by all EU funded projects.

The following ass- ptions and risks that can affect the project have been identiﬁed:

0 GoM is committed to implementing the National (Sugar) Adaptation Strategy.

0 GoM is committed to review its legislation to promote a more business friendly environment in
the sugar sector.

0 The CfP is successful and grant contracts are implemented correctly

0 Global and regional sugar prices do not decrease signiﬁcantly.

- Illovo (private sector) implements its expansion scheme of Nchalo and Dwangwa processing
mills leading to increased demand for cane. ‘

o Illovo honours its cane agreements.

0 Availability of suitable land for green ﬁeld sites or within 60 kms of existing sugar processing
plants at Dwangwa and Nchalo.

0 Agreement of Traditional Authorities and local communities.

0 The transport infrastructure in Malawi and the regions is maintained or improved.

Dialogue amongst stakeholders in Malawi is of vital importance to make sure that these assumptions
are indeed implemented and that risks are mitigated. In this context the role of the Sugar Steering
Committee is extremely important and the EC can report that it works effectively and efﬁciently.
With regards to mitigating the risks associated to the CfP and organisations' capacity to respond to
the CfP, it should be noted that the EC Delegation, in association with the GoM, has given a number
of week-long training courses on how to make a successful grant application. In addition, the 60M
and the EC Delegation signed grant contracts of approximately 6 14M with organisations in Malawi
in 2007.

In order to ensure that resources are used according to grant guidelines, applicants will be
encouraged to use grant funding to hire additional staff if necessary (project manager, accounts). In
addition the EC Delegation will hold, as it did in January 2008, a clariﬁcation meeting with all new
and existing grant beneﬁciaries to ensure that they fully understand the terms of their grant contacts
and to highlight good practice by grant beneﬁciaries. The EC also provides continual support during
implementation which will be overseen by the Sugar Steering Committee.

22 Expected results

Despite the proﬁtability of sugar in Malawi new out grower schemes have not occurred
spontaneously. Out growers' schemes are institutionally complex often requiring a high degree of
organisational management that balances farmers needs with business acumen. This can act as a

deterrent to potential investors. Secondly, in order to achieve higher yields sugar cane needs to be
grown under irrigation in Malawi. Installing irrigation systems requires signiﬁcant capital

1 investment and despite the improving macro-economic situation in Malawi access to credit,
particularly in the agricultural sector, is difﬁcult. This stems partly from past experiences of poor
loan repayments and partly from the banking sector’s lack of knowledge of agriculture. By making
grant funding available this action may act as an incentive to the expansion and/0r creation of new
out grower schemes.

The expected results are threefold:

1) More hectares of irrigated sugar cane are farmed by out growers.
2) Incomes of new out growers are increased.
3) Quantity of sugar produced in Malawi by out growers is increased.

Results can be expected at one or two levels. At the highest level, the action can assist in the
development of new out growers’ scheme on green ﬁeld sitess. That is, the setting up of new sugar
processing mills and production areas. Following the changes to the Sugar Protocol a number of
companies are looking to relocate from ‘unproﬁtable’ countries and invest in other ‘proﬁtable’
countries, such as Malawi4. The amount under this action can be coupled with ﬁnancing from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and concessions from the GoM.

 

At a lower level, but still with a very positive outcome, would be the creation of new schemes or
expansion of existing schemes that serve existing sugar processing mills in Dwangwa and Nchalo.
Both of these sugar processing mills are currently expanding their capacities.

In both cases the action is expected to increase the production of sugar (cane and processed
product) in Malawi, which is beneﬁcial for the macro—economic situation (exports, foreign
exchange, etc.), as well as increasing the incomes of the new out growers, leading to signiﬁcant
poverty reduction in the areas of implementation, as already witnessed under on-going out
growers’ schemes.

Applicants will also be encourage to set up community funds where the ultimate beneﬁciaries of
the EC grant funding (new out growers) pay ‘interest’ into a fund that can be used for community
development, hence widening the beneﬁciary base of the action.

2.3 Activities and implementation timetable

The single activity in the AAP 2008 is the launching of a competitive Call for Proposals for the
award of grant contracts for the creation of new and/or the expansion of existing out grower
schemes. It is envisaged that actions under the grant contracts will include; works contracts for the
clearing and levelling of the ﬁelds, the installation of the irrigation system, the construction of cane
haulage roads; procurement of equipment; staﬁ‘ costs; training costs for both farmers and
management; actions on cross cutting issues (environment, gender, HIV/AIDS). Grant contracts
will also have to include 1-3% of the cost of the total action under a visibility budget line.

 

3. LOCATION AND DURATION

3.1 Location

The location of interventions will depend on the proposals received. However, if the highest order
results are to be realised, that is, the creation of a new green ﬁeld sites, then this is likely to be
along the lakeshore either in Karonga District, which is in the far north on the border with

 

There are a number of potential green ﬁeld sites the most suitable are along the lake shore in Karonga, Salima and Bwanje Valley.

Sl’ossibg new investors include ClEL group, Huletts, Crooks Brothers, Sree Ranuka in association with Tate and Lyle; and Transvaal
ugar oard.

-_--_-—_-_-_-__—-‘-

Tanzania, Salima District, in the central region or in Bwanje Valley, which is on the Dedza and
Mangochi District border. If proposals are for the creation of new and/or expansion around the two
existing sugar mills then interventions will have to be located within a 60 km radius of the exrstrng
mills at Dwangwa and Nchalo. Dwangwa is situated in Nkhotakota District in the central region of
Malawi and lies on the western lakeshore about 300 kms north east of Lilongwe. Nchalo is in
Chikwawa district in the southern region, about 80 kms south of Blantyre.

3.2. Duration

The execution period of the Agreement will be 96 months. This execution period will comprise 2

phases under the conditions provided for in Article 4.1 of the General Conditions (Annex I of the
prCSent Agreement):

1. Operational implementation phase that starts from the entry into force of the ﬁnancing
agreement and will have duration of 72 months.

2. Closure phase of a duration of 24 months that starts from the expiry date of the operational
implementation phase.
