OVERVIEW OF COFFEE [VDl'STRY AND RELEVANCE
GENERAL C ONTEXI

On averaZe 80‘- of Maiawi‘s exports are made of Agricultural .
commodiiies and out of this. Tobacco accounts for about 65%. while tea,

(“92! and Coﬁee accounts for 7° 0. 6° 0 and 3% respectively.

National Coffee pmdmtion reached its peak of 7000mt in 1992 but since
m It: prodwxion has been declining. It reached 1500mt m 2005. The

drop had been due to poor intemational prices. forcing most estates to

replace Coffee vn'th either macadamia or tea. C urrently. most estates
which are allocated in the southern region of Malawi have taken Coffee

Win15 as pan time (Acct?! SABLE fanning (bigger producer seconded
by Mmzu Collect. While the estates have been reducing land under
Cuffs: [he mﬂholder sub sector has been planting almost 1 million
Coﬁ'ee plants mnually for the past 8 years leading to increased production
from 90 rm in 1099 to #00 mt in 2008 with estimate of 1000 ml by

20”- 15.

C oﬁee getting by smallholders has proved more proﬁtable because
was LEE family lath and no investments in irrigation facilities is
done. Coffee WW‘UOD under estates is expensive because of large
ovum

Th: Ion! contribution of Coﬁ‘ee by smallholder sub sector has improved
from 2.6". 10 vars ago to slightly our 20% by 2008. This is expected to
me in between 35.50“ . by 5014 if. C oﬂ‘ee production by smallholdcrs
in thvri has concentrate-d in Northern highlands of Malawi covering
Misuku hills. in Chitipa district. P‘hoka and Yiphya hills in Rumphi
district. Nlhatabay highlands in Nkhatahay Mzimba districts and South
East Mn'mba in .‘slzirnba District. lhere are 2600 growers currently but
the number is expected to be over 3000 growers in 3 years time. It was
initially expected that more growers would start growing Coffee after
subsidized fertilizers were introduced. Now that government has
withdrawn subsidy program for cash crops. no many new growers are
expected as the Union does not have adequate ﬁnancial resources to do so.

The challenge for smallholder Coffee industry in Malawi is [0 build on
some achievements realized in the past 10 years and seek ways of

optimizing Coffee production system that provides increased farm income
levels. Annex 2 attached outlines the institutional structure of the union
and its underlying structure, and the vision of MZCPCU with aim of
addressing smallholder Coffee industry.

AREAS fOR Dﬂ’ROVEMLYI

COFFEE PRICE th Ci‘t‘ATIUN AND GROWERS PAYMENT.

The main problems mentioned by Coffee growers regarding Coffee
production and marketing are low coffee prices and delays in Coffee

payment

Lo» Coﬁ‘ce  are mentioned because price of inputs of Coffee
inermsed coincidentl} in 2008. This. therefore, calls for production
systems dial do not rel} heavily on chemical fertilizer and pcstcides.
Possibility of producmg good quality Coffee and certiﬁed Coffees
requm: more mention.

Delays in grower's payment are a result of delays of receipt of funds

after CotToe export Tnis would require exploring other means of
atom chm trade t'mancing through forward contracts.

Beginning from 2039. MZC PC L’ accessed external financing through

PRODUCTION, QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

Most of the varieties grovm are less resistant to pests and diseases and
do not survive under open cultivation system. This project may assist in
introducing varieties that are tolerant to most disease and pests. The
varieties of acceptable quality especially on speciality market shall be
sought. Proper shading of bananas and perennial trees will be
introduced especially with new plantings. Coffee holding size will have
to be improved from 1400 trees (0.25ha trees) per grower to 2400 trees

30% of all growers to be female. C urrently. thatabay Cooperative has 35% of
the growers as “men while shsuht has the lOWest °/o (l 3).

of separating Coffee of non members from members.

Investments in processing facilities and equipment m‘ll assist in building
capacities amongSI Cooperatives and farmer organizations. Besides the 3000

Coll'ce growers, C0839 Association of Malatti would beneﬁt from the laboratory
equipment to be supplied to CAMAL “here all Coffee growers would beneﬁt.

Through participating in international Coifee conferences and exhibition, allff d
C offce growers would beneﬁt through exposition of all Miriam Coffees. Sta an
farmers will be trained in use of equipment to be purchased.

The government of Malawi would beneﬁt from increased forex eamrngs through
increased Coffee exports at premium prices.

MZCPCU will from time work closely with Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Security staff at ADD, project and EPA level, through meetmgs and trainings.

6.0 NEEDS AND CONSTRAINTS OF TARGET GROUPS.

The project vvill target smallholder Coffee growers with their related farmer
organizations. Main problems experienced by smallholder Coffee growers fall

under the following categories:

 high cost of production. poor seedlings production.

tiii) FAJL‘IER ORGAN’IZATIONS .xV D COOPERATIVES.

Low pamcrpatlon b) members- poor govemance and management are
problems frequently met by Coffee organizations. MZC PC L7 and C AMAL
require orientation in areas of C otfee marketing. processing and
sustainable coffee production systems. A lot of training efforts in areas of
governance. internal communication. management capacities will be
carried out. An extensive SWOT-analysis was carried out in the
framework of the Medium Term Strategic Plan 2007 08-2012-13. at the
various levels: L’nion. Cooperatives. Business zones. Business Centres.
Individual Coffee Farmers and the Savings and Credit Union.

(iv) SELF SUSTAINABILITY

For the Coffee growers, very few are able to remain in business for more
than 15 year. Similarly. because of continued low Coffee production, most
farmer organizations are unable to self sustain themselves.

By implementing this project, some of these needs and constraints are likely to be
addressed hence making Coffee business more attractive to the members.
