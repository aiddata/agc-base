Assessment of Whether Irish Aid should ﬁnance the Seed Component of the Subsidy
Programme this Vear

1.

This is a successful programme that is the centerpiece of Malawi’s agricultural
development programme (ASWAP).

The Malawi Government has asked Irish Aid to target its support to the legume seed
component. This is the component of the programme that addresses diversification,
nutrition and soil fertility enhancement — all key to the Country Strategy Paper.

Support to the subsidy programme is complementary to other investments by Irish Aid, in
particular legume seed multiplication under lCRISAT and our other investments in
nutrition (CTC) soil fertility enhancement (ICRAF) strengthening capacity of the Seed
Services Department (through ICRISAT) and crop diversification (CIP).

This is, at present, the only component of the agriculture programme where Irish Aid
channels resources directly into the Malawi Government Budget. Under our CAADP
commitments, we have agreed to progressively align to the ASWAP and channel an
increased proportion of funds through the Government budget — retreating from that
principle, particularly during the period when Irish Aid holds the DCAFS Chair would be
perceived as a movement in the wrong direction — and could cause problems on the
political side.

Irish Aid and other donors ﬁnancing the Seed Subsidy Component are working very hard
to strengthen monitoring of the legume seed component through complementary
investments in verification of genetic purity and germination percentage.

The Government has come some way in terms of addressing some of the concerns
expressed by donors: all legume seed will be certiﬁed, the legume seed component has
increased — with attendant beneﬁts for soil fertility and nutrition. and the overall
programme is moving in the right direction.

In assessing whether to ﬁnance this programme or not, it is important to be conscious of and

assess potential drawbacks. The following issues have been highlighted:

The PETS study (not released) which shows significant diversion of coupons. This is a
preliminary report and both DFID and World Bank have questioned the validity of the
data. We remain unclear about the status of the report and the Ministry has not had the
opportunity to respond.

Concerns about the transparency of procurement under the fertilizer component. This
issue was raised by the World Bank. This is an issue which should be raised by the
overall DCAFS Group.

Reports of inﬂation of household numbers by the ACE. These issues have been
highlighted and it remains to be seen how the Ministry ongriculture will respond.

 

Overall Assessment

There are very signiﬁcant positives with the Seed Component of the Subsidy Programme —
Norway, DFlD and the European Commission have all indicated that they will fund the
programme provided that the Government releases the 2007/08 Audit Report. There is
consensus that it is better to continue to ﬁnance and inﬂuence the operations of the Subsidy
Programme which is the centerpiece of Malawi’s Agricultural Strategy. The donor group is
following issues very carefully and has managed to promote reforms throughout the

implementation ofthe programme.
