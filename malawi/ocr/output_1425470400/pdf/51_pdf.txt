THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
Title : Support to the Implementation of the Malawi Land Reform
Programme
Accounting N°: 9 ACP MAI 012

Identiﬁcation N°: MAI/ 7040/ 001

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 MAIN FEATURES OF THE SECTOR

Agriculture accounts for more than 35% of Malawi’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and for
about 85% of its export earnings. Smallholder agriculture contributes about 30% of GDP, and
employs more than 80% of the rural labour force. So raising the productivity of smallholder
agriculture is key to achieving rapid and sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction
in the country.

More than 90% of land in Malawi is held under customary law and managed by traditional
authorities on behalf of the state. Registered private land, including freehold and leasehold,
accounts for less than 8% of total land area. Several issues need to be addressed:

0 many farmers have little access to productive resources and limited skills, so most
arable land, whether held under leasehold or customary tenure, is under-exploited;

0 many farmers have little access to land and agricultural inputs, so their productivity
has fallen;

a rising population densities have caused environmental degradation;

0 since independence and until relatively recently, Malawi had no comprehensive land
policy, and there is still no proper land legislation in place; and;

o land-related policy-making has been hampered by poor planning, weak co-ordination,
an absence of pro-active interventions, and limited management capacity at all levels
of the country’s administration.

To address these issues, the government of Malawi (GoM) recently established a Policy

Flaming Unit in the Ministry of Land, Physical Planning and Surveys, to review land policy.
As a result:

0 a legal framework for land reform is currently being drafted;
0 national spatial data infrastructure is being established; and

o in 2003, a new Land Policy was approved after wide consultation: the aim of the
Policy is to ensure land tenure security and equitable access to land.

In addition, a comprehensive land law is being developed, under the aegis of a Special Law
Commission instituted in early 2003 to review all land-related legislation.

1.2 PROBLEMS TO BE ADDRESSED
Addressing the root causes of land-related poverty requires:
0 an appropriate legal framework;

0 strong administrative institutions;

o adequately qualiﬁed staff, in sufﬁcient numbers; and
o a sound land policy.

There is a clear political will to implement the National Land Policy, and public participation
is a priority of the emerging decentralization process. But the prerequisite legal and
institutional frameworks have yet to be established, and human capacity issues have still to be
addressed.

L OMCTIVES ANQ EXPECTED RESULTS.

2.1 OVERALL OBJECTIVE

To contribute to the sustainable use and management of land and land-based resources in
Malawi, and thereby to improve livelihoods, especially of people in rural areas.

2.2 PROJECT PURPOSE

To create an environment conducive to efﬁcient, effective implementation of the Land
Reform Programme (LRP).

2.3 RESULTS
The following results are expected:

1. strengthening of the institutional framework required to coordinate efﬁciently and
effectively the implementation of the LRP;

2. creation of the human resource capacities necessary to implement the LRP;
3. establishment of a legal framework conducive to LRP implementation; and
4. design and launch of a long-term support programme.

3. FACTORS ENSURING FEASIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY

The project will be implemented within the ﬁamework of the MLRPIS, which has been
conceived with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders.

The project will reinforce the continuation of this dialogue, and thereby ensure public
ownership of the land reform process. The same principle of broad consultation will be
applied to the drafting of the new Land Bill.

Once the land law becomes effective, land-based revenue will be created at both district and
national levels, allowing the GoM to continue the land reform process.

Lessons learned from this project will feed into the design of a second, more comprehensive

ﬁnancing proposal (as foreseen in the NIP) to support the Land Reform Process on a longer-
terrn basis.

 

3.1 LESSONS LEARNT FROM PREVIOUS PROJECTS/EVALUATIONS

Evaluation of ongoing land reform activity has shown that the successful implementation of
land reform requires sufﬁcient capacity, proper coordination between the stakeholders
involved, and popular participation. The core purpose of this project is to facilitate each of
these prerequisites.

3.2 ENVIRONMENT, GENDER MAINSTREAMING, AND OTHER ASPECTS

Cross-cutting issues are multi-sectoral, so they require close collaboration and co—ordination
between various stakeholders. The secretariat will actively support the Ministry in
establishing a stakeholder network and a system for co-ordinated mainstreaming of relevant
cross-cutting issues.

3.3 CO—ORDINATION WITH OTHER DONORS

Under the present project, linkages and co~ordination between donors in the sector will be
further strengthened to ensure effective collaboration, and avoid unnecessary overlapping.

4. IMPLEMENTATION

 

4.1 ACTIVITIES
The following activities will be implemented during the project:
1. Technical Land Services Secretariat (TLSS)

A Technical Land Services Secretariat (TLSS) will be established, and an assessment
conducted of the institutional capacity development needs for LRP implementation.

The TLSS will be responsible for:

o coordinating the design and creation of monitoring and evaluation systems;

0 ﬁnancial management, including cost recovery from land services; and

o mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues.
2. Information, Education and Communication Strategy
The project will support the implementation of the Information, Education and
Communication Strategy that has been developed by the Ministry to increase public
participation in the land reform process.

3. Education and training

The delivery of basic training will be supported, through certiﬁcate training at the Natural
Resources College.

For higher education, support will be channelled through diploma and bachelors degree
courses at the University of Malawi and at Mzuzu University.

 

4. Legislative consultation

The project will support the consultative process for reviewing the draft bill on laws
regulating land matters.

5. Longer—term support

The project will also facilitate the drafting of project documentation for the EU’s long-term
support programme to Malawi’s Land Reform Process (mentioned above).

ANNEX V
AN OVERVIEW OF THE LAND REFORM PROCESS IN MALAWI AND
PRIORITY AREAS FOR EU SUPPORT.
N“

1.0 Introduction.
M

Until very recently in 2002, the Government of Malawi (GOM) has had no
comprehensive land policy since independence. As a result, the policy environment in
the land sector in Malawi has been characterised by poor planning, weak co—
ordination, predominance of reactive interventions (absence of proactive
interventions) and limited management capacity for land administration at all levels.
To address this anomaly, GOM established the Policy Flaming Unit in the Ministry
of Lands, Physical Planning and Surveys to review the status of the land policy in
Malawi.

From 1996 through 1999, the Ministry, with ﬁnancial and technical assistance ﬁom
various Development Partners, notably, World Bank, DANIDA, FAO and UNDP
supported the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Land tenure issues. In addition,
various technical studies ﬁnanced by DFID, USAID and the EC were undertaken to
provide the empirical and analytical basis for any proposed policy reforms. These
studies included: Land Use Study, A Tracer Study based on National Sample Survey
of Agriculture, A socio—economic Study, Estate and Customary Land Interaction

A).

Taking the Commission of Inquiry’s ﬁndings as a point of departure, the Ministry
prepared a new comprehensive Land Policy, which was accepted as the ofﬁcial policy
of Government on 17th January 2002.

2.0 Goal and Objectives of the National Land Policy

2.1 Policy Goal

The goal of the National Land Policy is to ensure land tenure security and equal
access to land and to facilitate the attainment of social harmony and broad based
socio~economic development through optimum and ecologically balanced use of
land and land based resources in the country.

2.2 Obi ectives of the Land Policy
The immediate objectives of the National Land Policy objectives are as follows:

0 Promote land tenure reforms that guarantee security and instil conﬁdence and
fairness in all land transactions

Promote a decentralised and transparent land administration system

Extend land use planning strategies to all urban and rural areas

Establish a modern land registration system for delivering land services to all
Enhance conservation and community management of local resources

Promote research and capacity building in land surveying and land
management

 

 

2.3 Policy Recommendations

The Land Policy has made several critical policy recommendations for transforming
the land sector into a more vibrant and productive sector. The most notable
recommendations relate to land access and tenure reforms, land use planning and
registration and land administration and dispute settlement.

3.0 Malawi Land Reform Programme Implementation Strategy (MLRPIS)

In order to translate the recommendations of the Policy into action, the Ministry, in
collaboration with various stakeholders, has prepared the Malawi Land Reform

3.1 Exoected results of the Land Reform Process

3.1.1 Enhanced Land Tenure security: it promotes conﬁdence and acceptance of
land rights. This will involve conducting public awareness about the land policy

provisions; preparing a legal framework for implementing the land policy; surveying
and registering land.

sale, negotiations between those that have land and those who need land, supporting
sustainable resettlement through investment in micro-proj ects and fonnalising land
rights through registration.

3.1.3 Transparent and participatory land governance and administration system: it
will promote credibility, acceptance and ownership. This will be achieved through
establishment of Village and district land committees and tribunals using the existing

unauthorised developments, and reduce environmental degradation. Major activities
include review and implementation of the national physical development plan,
conﬁrming district and international boundaries and carrying out hydrographic
surveys of major water bodies in Malawi. This entails that land use planning is
extended on all categories of land.

3.1.5 Strengthened Capacity for implementing a sustainable land reform process : it
will reduce the current serious deﬁcit of land administration and management skills
and systems at all levels, particularly in rural areas. This will involve building vanous

 

capacities at different levels, through training, provision of essential infrastructure and
equipment for land administration and management. Elements of cost recovery
measures of land services delivery will be tested and incorporated where feasible for

long term sustainability of services.

4.0 Capacity Constraints

Capacity constraints in terms of human resources, infrastructure and equipment are

evident at all levels. The major challenge is to fill the serious shortage of

professionals and technicians currently experienced at different levels of government
in the shortest possible time. According to the capacity need assessment conducted in

2002 by DANIDA, the capacity deﬁcit is enormous when comp
vacancies and expected stafﬁng for District Land Registries as

5.0 Priority Areas for EU Support

The EU support has been conceptualized within the context of objective 3.1.5 which
aims at strengthening the institutional capacity for implementing the land reform
process in Malawi. The idea is to support Government effort in enhancing land sector
capacity to deliver cost effective land services. This assistance will be a direct

response to some of the identiﬁed needs of the

1) Establishing Institutional Framework for Efﬁcient and Eﬂective Land Reform

Implementation Process

Establishing and strengthening the operational mechanisms necessary for sustaining
an efﬁcient and effective land administration and management system at all levels of

government is probably the most important for successful implementation of land

reforms in Malawi. Malawi is undergoing democratic reforms, which devolve
administrative authority and local development decisions close to the people. EU

 

' Land Clerks are the most urgently required to manage land registries at local level

 

 

support to the land reform process will provide assistance for developing new land
administration procedures to be implemented on pilot basis, which will see a large

collaboration.

and administrative competence. This deﬁcit will be addressed by specially designed
short term, intermediate and long-term training programmes and exposure to
innovative approaches to land management for all land sector stakeholders.

comprehensive registration of all customary land holding throughout the nation.
Simultaneously, Local Government Decentralisation Policy calls for the assessment of
all real estate and the development of ﬁscal capacity to support a newly decentralised

local government system. It is therefore obvious that this training program is
critically needed.

Creating a conducive legal framework for the Land Reform Process

EU will, during the Start-up Phase, support any outstanding activities of the work plan
of the Special Law Commission to ﬁnalise a comprehensive land law that Will prov1de
a conducive legal environment for the land reform process in Malaw1.

Pilot activities for registration and land data management

5.0 Legal and Policy Framework

5.1 Policv framework

The Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy developed on 2001 and the 1998 Local
Government Act provide an overall policy framework for sustainable poverty
reduction in Malawi. Since land is a basic factor of production, as well as the sole
source of livelihood for the majority of Malawi’s, its sustainable use and management
is a pre-requisite for pro-poor growth and improved livelihoods. The Local
Government Act introduces a high degree of decentralisation and devolves important
management responsibilities to local assemblies. Within the context of
Decentralisation Policy, the National Land Policy recommends that land
administration and management should take place at district and local levels. The Act
explicitly decentralises powers on land planning, land registration, acquisition and
disposal. MPRSP, Decentralisation Policy and Land Policy regard political will and
popular participation as important governance objectives for any reform to succeed.

5.2 The Legal framework

The Constitution of Malawi provides the general legal framework for the land reform
process in Malawi as it calls on the state to respect and uphold the human right to
property, economic activity and development. However, soon after the adoption of
the National Land Policy, Government recognised the need for a speciﬁc legal
framework for implementing the new land policy principles. A Special Law
Commission was, therefore, instituted in March, 2003 to review all land related laws
in order to come up with a new comprehensive land law that is compatible with the
Country’s Constitution and the new land policy. The Special Commission is currently
almost through with reviewing of laws relating to customary land, which is the largest
land tenure category in Malawi. The new land law is expected to ready by December
2003 or early 2004. This will provide the legal framework for land reforms in Malawi.
