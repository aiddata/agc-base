Dear Christian,

Please find the updated list of FAO Projects as you requested.

Kindly note that all TCP projects are national and not district based.

I will be forwarding the project documents in separate emails as they are many and could be huge.

Feel free to come back to us if you see some gaps.
With regards,

Julia Chagunda

Subject: FAO Geomapping Information

Dear Alick,

Many thanks, again, for meeting with myself and my colleague, Josh Powell (CC’d here), this morning regarding
the joint Development Gateway-Ministry of Finance geomapping efforts. I also CC Magdalena Kouneva, UNDP
Aid Effectiveness Advisorto the MoF.

I attach, for your convenience and that of your colleagues, the following:

o a soft copy of the 2—pager on the geomapping efforts; and
o the list of projects we were unable to map from FAO due to missing project documents/information.

You asked us to clarify precisely what kinds of information would be most helpful. In our past work (both in
Malawi and with World Bank/AfDB), we have found that project appraisal documents or project planning
documents are most likely to contain the geographic information that we need. Grant/loan agreements can be
helpful as well, but only when they have a technical annex that contains a detailed project description. We would
be quite grateful if you were able to email us copies of these documents.

If the project documents are unavailable, then a list of all locations in which a project has activities is helpful as
well. As mentioned, this is what UNDP was able to provide for us. We can map to the city/town/village level, so
the most specific information available is best. Also, in cases where the city and district have the same name, it
is helpful to indicate which (i.e. writing Blantyre City instead of Blantyre) to prevent confusion.

As discussed, we would greatly appreciate if you could provide us with this information by 20 September 2011.

Thank you once again for hosting us and for your assistance.
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions and/or concerns.

Best,
Christian
