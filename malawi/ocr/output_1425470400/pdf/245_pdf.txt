EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 

Programme Background

 

Achieving the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a major challenge,
particularly given the poor macroeconomic environment, increasing levels of poverty, the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the critical shortage of human resources in the health sector. Life
expectancy has declined steadily from 40.2 to 37.5 years in the past few years, mainly due to
the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These challenges have justified the development of a SWAp by the
MOHP and its Development Partners. In the 4th National Health Plan 1999 — 2004, the
Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) expressed its intention to adopt and develop the
Sector—Wide Approach (SWAp) within which the Programme of Works (POW) would be
developed and implemented with the view to improving the health status in Malawi.

The SWAp arrangement is meant to improve efficiency and equity of available resources, by
reducing the fragmentation and duplication resulting from a multitude of separate, externally
financed projects. To make the SWAp operational, the MOHP developed a Programme of
Work (POW) for July 2004 — July 2010. The POW outlines the priority health activities to be
implemented by the MOHP, Development Partners and NGOs. Strategies and resource
implications for these activities have also been outlined. ADF’s contribution to the
implementation of POW through a SWAp shall be pooled together with funds from other
Development Partners and GOM.

Purpose of the Grant

The proposed ADF grant of UA 20 million will be used to finance goods, works and services
needed for the establishment of an effective and efficient health care delivery system that is
responsive to the needs of the people of Malawi.

Sector Goal and Obiectives 0f the Programme

The programme will contribute to raising the level of health status of all Malawians by
reducing the incidence of illness and occurrence of premature deaths in the population.

The programme objective is to establish through a SWAp arrangement, an effective and
efficient health care delivery system that is responsive to the needs of the people of Malawi,
especially the vulnerable groups, the poor, women and children.

Description

ADF’s contribution over a period of 42 months will support implementation of all the six
programmes of the POW, namely, (i) Human Resources; (ii) Pharmaceutical and Medical
Supplies; (iii) Essential Basic Equipment; (iv) Facilities Development; (v) Routine
Operations at Service Delivery Level; and (vi) Central Operations, Policy and Systems
Development Programme

ix

Financing Requirements

The total cost of financing the Programme of Work (2004 — 2010) for the SWAp is USD
735.00 million. The total of ADF’s contribution to the POW is estimated at USD 30.10
million (UA 20.00 million).

Sources of Finance

The Government and Development Partners will jointly finance the POW for the SWAp. The
Bank Group’s intervention, which is part of the SWAp, will be jointly financed by ADF,
other Development Partners and the Government of Malawi. ADF funds will be utilized to
finance services, goods, works, and miscellaneous expenditure. The total ADF contribution
representing 3.8% of total costs will be utilized to cover both foreign exchange and local
costs.

Implementation of the Programme

The programme will be implemented over a period of 42 months. The executing agency of
the programme will be the Ministry of Health and Population.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The proposed ADF’s contribution responds to Malawi’s need to implement the POW (2004 —
2010). ADF’s contribution will be channeled through Basket Funding to add Government’s
effort in enhancing access of the rural population to the Essential Health Package. In this
regard and in line with Section 4.2 under item “Policies and Procedures” of the Guidelines for
the Bank Group Operations Using Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps), it is recommended that
the Board approve a waiver on the application of the “rule of origin,” “pooling of resources”
and “rule on replenishment for the special account.” The proposed ADF’s contribution will
be used to finance goods, works and services needed for the establishment of an effective and
efficient health care delivery system that is responsive to the needs of the people of Malawi.
It will complement the support of other donors to the implementation of the POW through a
SWAp arrangement for the health sector.

It is recommended that an ADF grant not exceeding UA 20.00 million be extended to the
Government of Malawi for the purpose of contributing to the SWAp as described in this
report, subject to conditions specified in the Protocol of Grant Agreement.

l. ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE PROGRAMME

1.1 Achieving the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a major
challenge, particularly given the poor macroeconomic environment, increasing levels of
poverty, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the critical shortage of human resources in the health
sector. In the 4th National Health Plan 1999 — 2004, the Ministry of Health and Population
(MOHP) expressed its intention to adopt and develop the Sector—Wide Approach (SWAp)
within which the Programme of Works (POW) would be developed and implemented. The
POW was to focus on the delivery of the Essential Health Package (EHP), which is a
component of the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy. The development of the POW was an
all—inclusive process over a sustained period of time. In November 2002, the MOHP, its
Development Partners, and stakeholders agreed on the framework within which the GOM
would implement the SWAp. To operationalize it, a POW covering the period July 2004 —
July 2010 was developed.

1.2 The POW outlines a shared and preferred future for the health sector and proposes
strategic options for bringing this about. It also highlights priority health activities to be
implemented by the MOHP, Development Partners and Non—Governmental Organizations
(NGOs), and their resource implications. A comprehensive costing exercise of the Essential
Health Package preceded the process of developing the POW and several Government policy
and planning documents were reviewed. A number of studies were also carried out in order
to facilitate the prioritization process. In addition, the POW assessed the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats to its implementation. The development of the POW
also took into account Government stated objectives articulated in a number of key policy
documents including the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Vision 2020 Document,
the 4th Malawi National Health Plan 1999 — 2004, the MDGs, and other policy and
operational documents.

1.3 Implementation of POW through SWAps is intended to provide a basis for
harmonization of procedures for procurement and financial management, management of
logistics, and monitoring and evaluation. The SWAp also offers the opportunity to bringing
consistency between national plans, external support, sustainability and commitment of GOM
and development partners to the Essential Health Package (EHP) interventions in the POW.
The Bank Group took part in joint identification (August 2003), preparation (November
2003), pre—appraisal (April 2004) and post appraisal (July 2004) missions with the World
Bank, DFID and NORAD. The design of the Support to the Health Sector Programme is,
therefore, a product of a joint definition of critical areas of intervention, funding modalities,
implementation arrangements as well as monitoring and evaluation of the activities. The
Appraisal Report was updated following the December 2004 supervision mission of the
health sector in Malawi.

1.4 The proposed ADF’s support through pooled funding is in line with the objectives of
the GOM’s goals and objectives in the POW for 2004 — 2010. It conforms to the Bank
Group's harmonization efforts to reduce transaction costs of development assistance, improve
the effectiveness, and efficiency of aid delivery and management. The proposed support is
also in conformity with the Bank Group’s Health Sector Policy, the Guidelines for the Bank
Group Operations using Sector—Wide Approaches, and the Bank Group's Updated 2002 — 04
Country Strategy for Malawi which stresses the need to achieve economic growth and
sustained development, including poverty reduction and improved quality of human
resources.

2. THE HEALTH SECTOR
2.1 Health Status

2.1.1 The extent of poverty in Malawi is reflected in its health indicators. Life expectancy
has in the past few years declined from 40.2 years (1998) to 37.5 years in 2002 (female: 37.7
years) mainly as a result of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although some of the
health indicators are broadly comparable with neighboring countries, the infant mortality and
child mortality rates remain high even by regional standards at 104 and 189 per 1, 000 live
births respectively. The maternal mortality rate is even more alarming at 1,120 deaths per
100, 000 live births (2000), an increase from a rate of 620 recorded in the previous 10 year
period. Maternal mortality, apart from reﬂecting access and coverage of maternal health care
services, is a proxy for general socio—economic conditions and nutrition. It is estimated that
49% of children under the age of five years are clinically malnourished or stunted. Child
mortality reflects the extent and impact of prevailing poverty levels and, thus, is an indicator
of socio—economic development.

2.1.2 Facility—based morbidity and mortality figures indicate that Malawi's disease patterns
are similar to those of other tropical countries of Africa. As shown in Table 2.1, the leading
causes of morbidity in 2002 were malaria, acute respiratory diseases and diarrhoeal diseases.

2.1.4 In the absence of data by age and sex due to inadequate staffing, Malawi’s Health
Management Information System (HMIS) undertakes Annual Facility Based Records Review

for age—sex disaggregated data. The main objective of the review is to collect age and sex
disaggregated data from facility—based records of the routinely collected data in order to
understand better the distribution of diseases and utilization of services at national level. The
most recent review was conducted in 2003 and its results indicate the following:

- From the 5,366 sample cases that visited Out Patients Department for treatment
(Annex VI), 54% were female and 46% male. Out of the 1,722 malaria cases
observed, 58% were female and 42% male. For upper respiratory infection, 55%
were female and 45% male. The results above underscore the fact that malaria is
the leading cause of morbidity in the country.

- Out of a sample of 1,479 inpatient deaths, 51% were male and 49% female
(Annex VII). Out of the 320 malaria inpatient deaths, 53% were male and 47%
female. For pneumonia—all ages, 52% were male and 48% female. The sex
distribution on inpatient deaths for most diseases was similar to those shown
above.

2.1.5 HIV/AIDS is the leading contributor to the causes of death in the most productive age
group (20—48 years). Sentinel surveillance of HIV/AIDS amongst women attending antenatal
clinics gives an overall prevalence of 24%, with regional variations: 27.6% in the south; 23%
in the centre and 21% in the north, and higher rates of infection in the urban areas.
HIV/AIDS related conditions are reported to account for over 40% of all inpatient admissions
and are increasingly overwhelming the health services. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is fuelling
the TB epidemic. Since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Malawi, there has been a five—
fold increase in TB cases. In 2001 there were 27,672 new cases. A countrywide survey
showed an overall HIV sero—prevalence amongst TB patients of 77%.

2.2 Policy and Organisation of the Health Sector

A. Health Policy

2.2.1 The Government's overall development objective is poverty reduction. The Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (2002), which emphasizes human capital development, is key to
poverty reduction. The Govemment’s overall goal for the health sector, as stated in the
PRSP, is to “raise the level of health status of all Malawians by reducing the incidence of
illness and occurrence of premature deaths in the population”.

2.2.2 The primary health strategy for the MOHP is the implementation of an Essential
Health Package (EHP). The EHP explicitly rations resources in order to prioritize cost—
effective interventions to reduce poverty. It addresses the major causes of morbidity and
mortality among the general population and focuses particularly on medical conditions and
service gaps that disproportionately affect the rural poor. Its objectives are to improve
technical and allocative efficiency in the delivery of health care; to ensure universal coverage
of health services; and to provide cost—effective interventions that can control the main causes
of disease burden in Malawi.

2.2.3 The EHP consists of a cluster of cost—effective interventions delivered together in
order to reduce the total cost of the interventions by reducing the cost to patients obtaining
the services as well as the costs of providing services. These form the basis for an integrated
delivery strategy for the EHP interventions. The EHP brings together interventions that can
be delivered with the same level of technological sophistication and through the same facility
or level of the health delivery system and using multi—skilled health workers. The decision to

select the interventions constituting an essential health package is based upon the cost—
effectiveness of each of the interventions and on the basis of their being able to be controlled
at less than US$100 per Disability—Adjusted Life Year (DALY) gained.

2.2.4 The Malawi EHP consists broadly of the following eleven intervention areas:

I Prevention and Treatment of vaccine preventable diseases.

I Malaria Prevention and Treatment

I Reproductive Health Interventions — including Safe Motherhood Initiatives,
Essential Obstetric Care and PMTCT.

I Prevention, control and treatment of Tuberculosis and related complications.

I Prevention and treatment of Schistosomiasis and related complications.

I Management of Acute Respiratory Infections and related complications.

I Prevention, treatment and care for Acute Diarrhoeal Diseases (including cholera).

I Prevention and management of HIV/AIDS, Sexually Transmitted Infections and
related complications including VCT and the provision of ARVT.

I Prevention and management of Malnutrition, Nutrition deficiencies — (iodine,
Vitamin A, Iron) and related complications, especially those associated with
HIV/AIDS.

I Management of eye, ear and skin infections and related complications.

I Treatment of common injuries — including emergency care for accidents and
trauma and their complications.

2.2.5 The overarching strategy for the implementation of the 6—Year Program of Work
(POW) for the period 2004—2010 is based on the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) to health
development and the reorganization of the health sector based on the principle of
decentralization of health services to District Assemblies. Operational strategies will be
based on the delivery of public health programs, institution—based clinical interventions and
enhancing management and support systems throughout the MOHP. In broad terms this will
involve putting in place the following:

I Provision of up—to—date service delivery standards for all EHP and non—EHP
interventions.

I Training of an adequate number of health personnel to deliver the EHP through
the implementation of the 6 Year Emergency Pre—Service Training Plan.

I Providing adequate supplies of Essential Drugs, Medical Supplies and Laboratory
Consumables.

I Provision of adequate and appropriate Medical and Non—Medical Equipment to
support the delivery of the EHP.

I Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.

I Providing Water, Electricity and Radio Communications to health facilities.

I Providing Budget Support and strengthening systems for accountability at the
District level.

I Commissioning of new/improved EHP or non—EHP interventions.

I Strengthening management and support systems at the District level.

2.2.6 In terms of its purpose, content and the preparation process, the POW is effectively
the equivalent of the National Health Plan (NHP) for the 2004 — 2010 planning period. The
MOHP and collaborating partners concluded that the development of a separate and discrete
fifth NHP was not necessary. The analysis of the resource implications of the Plan as well as
the projection of resource inﬂows was not as detailed as the one in the POW. Similarly, the
analysis of the activities in the NHP is not as detailed as the one in the POW.

B. Organization of Health Services

2.2.7 The Government is the main provider of health care in Malawi. It has overall
responsibility for developing policies, planning strategies and programmes, and also ensuring
that quality of services are provided to the population. It carries out its functions under the
overall responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Population, which has a Secretary for
Health and Population, assisted by an Under Secretary who is responsible for the financial
and administrative affairs of the MOHP. The MOHP has six technical divisions (Clinical and
Population Services, Nursing, Preventive Health, Technical Support, Planning, Financing and
Administration). The current functions of the MOHP range from policy formulation and
planning to delivery of health services.

2.2.8 Below the central level, the MOHP is divided into 27 districts. Each district has a
District Health Officer (DHO) who is accountable to the Principal Secretary. The DHO and
his/her team run the District Hospital and the peripheral health units (health centres,
dispensaries and mobile clinics). A new government policy on national decentralization has
been approved in order to devolve administrative authority to the district level. The DHO
will have the responsibility for the management of all health services in the district. The
GOM has made a policy direction to decentralize health services to District Assemblies as the
local governance structures. This will necessitate direct budgetary allocation to the districts
thus making District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) in turn to be accountable to the
District Assemblies for decisions on financial planning and expenditures.

2.2.9 A 1998 functional review led to the abolition of the three regional health offices, with
monitoring and supervision responsibility shifting back to the centre. This proved
unsuccessful, with the result that the MOHP has decided to establish zonal offices, each
providing support to five to six districts, but not having management responsibility. Their
function will include technical advice and facilitation support of decentralization, EHP
implementation, and inter—district collaboration.

2.2.10 In Malawi, as in other low—income countries, the health sector is characterized by a
plurality of health service providers. Nearly all—formal health care services in Malawi are
provided by two main agencies. The Ministry of Health and Population provides about 60%
and the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) provides 37%. The Ministry of
Local Government provides about 1% of health services. Private practitioners, commercial
companies, army and police, provide 2% of health services. Traditional Birth Attendants
deliver approximately 25% of the pregnant women and most communities have a traditional
healer. Other sources of care include grocery stores and pharmacies, and to a lesser extent
Community—Based Distribution Agent for family planning commodities, Drug Revolving
Funds provided by community volunteers, home based care volunteers and faith healing
groups.

Human Resources

2.2.11 The workforce in the health sector as a whole is estimated at 15,700 (Human
Resource Plan, 1999—2004). This does not include an estimated 3,600 traditional birth
attendants and 2,300 community—based distributor agents for contraceptives. Sixty eight
percent (68%) of the workforce are employees of the MOHP. The CHAM employs some
26% with the remaining 6% divided among local government, police, army and non—
governmental organizations (NGOs).

2.2.12 In terms of staff, numbers of health personnel per head of population show large
differences from the WHO—recommended norms. According to the MOHP, the total number
of physicians in the country is 219, being one doctor per 45,662 Malawians, well below the
WHO average ratio of 1 to 10,000. For Malawi to reach this ratio, 800 additional doctors are
required. The MOHP has 108 general practitioners and specialists, while CHAM, the College
of Medicine and the private sector have 34, 21 and 56 medical officers respectively. The
College of Medicine produces about 20 doctors per year. Considering its population, this
figure is extremely low and this has resulted in heavy reliance on other categories of health
professionals such as clinical officers and nurses to carryout some of the work for doctors.

2.2.13 The distribution pattern of staff favours urban areas at the expense of rural areas,
where 87% of the population reside. This is due to the unattractive working environment in
the rural areas, i.e. lack of social amenities and accommodation.

2.2.14 According to the draft human resource strategic plan for 2003 — 2013, the current
major concern of the MOHP is to address the critical shortage of human resources resulting
from inadequate capacity of training institutions to produce the numbers of human resources
required to deliver the EHP. This strategy revolves around the sound implementation of the
6—year Emergency Pre—Service Training Plan for the sector which gives priority to financing
adequate numbers of trained and skilled personnel for all health facilities (including CHAM);
filling vacant posts; strengthening human resources retention; and providing in—service
training.

2.2.15 The civil service has a general policy on training that applies to all civil servants
including MOHP personnel. In the health sector two types of training are provided — basic
and post—basic (which incorporates external and in—service training). Basic training is
delivered through an array of institutions primarily within the Ministry of Education, MOHP
and CHAM.

Health Infrastructure

2.2.16 Health services are provided at three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary. At the
primary level, services are delivered through health centres, health posts, and outreach clinics.
District hospitals and CHAM hospitals, although some have specialist functions, provide
secondary level health care services. The secondary level provides mainly back up services
to those provided at the primary level including surgical services, mostly obstetric
emergencies, and general medical and paediatric in—patient care for common acute conditions.
At present, tertiary level hospitals provide services similar to those at the secondary level,
along with a small range of specialist surgical interventions.

2.2.17 Table 2.3 shows the distribution of health facilities by type and ownership (MOHP,
CHAM and Ministry Local Government). In all, there are 617 health facilities of which 392
(63.5%) are operated by MOHP and 161 (26.09%) by the Christian Association of Malawi
(CHAM). The remaining facilities are operated by NGOs such as Banjala Mutsugolo and by
the Local Government.

2.2.18 CHAM is made up of independent church—related and other private voluntary agency
facilities. It operates autonomously about 160 health units in the rural areas. Though
primarily curative in orientation, most units also provide primary health care services. Most
of these health institutions provide training for nurses and other health personnel. While
MOHP services are free, CHAM services are chargeable at small rate. The quality of
services provided at CHAM facilities is considered to be better than those at MOHP facilities.
The government assists CHAM by providing it with an annual grant. About 40% of their
operating funds come from government mainly covering staff salaries, 30% from donors and
30% from user fees. The agreement between the GOM and CHAM includes provision of
health services to the rural population in return for payment of an annual grant.

2.2.19 Accessibility to health facilities in Malawi is generally good, with up to 84% of the
population within 5 to 8 km of a health facility. Nevertheless, accessibility in some districts
is poorer than in others. The current total number of hospital beds is 14,128 (707
persons/hospital bed) of which 60% are in government health facilities while 37% belong to
CHAM and 3% belong to local authorities and other providers.

2.2.20 A recent assessment of health facilities indicated that a significant number of them
need rehabilitation and upgrading in order to be able to provide the full Essential Health
Package (EHP). Most of these facilities have serious shortages of essential drugs as well as
essential medical diagnostic equipment and surgical supplies. This is hampering
Government’s effort to minimize morbidity from treatable diseases such as malaria,
tuberculosis, etc. While many improvements have been made to the pharmaceutical system,
additional steps should be taken to strengthen it. In this regard, the World Bank is assisting the
MOHP in the establishment of a drug revolving fund, to ensure the supply of drugs through a
cost—sharing scheme at the tertiary level.

2.3 Health Care Financing

2.3.1 Health care financing in Malawi is composed of (i) Government financing through
voted expenditure and subventions to other providers; (ii) donor support through
Government’s development budget, commodity aid and direct support to programs and
support to other providers; and (iii) private sector expenditure on health care, and out of
pocket expenditure of household members.

2.3.2 According to the National Health Accounts for 1998/99 (the only year for which such
an analysis has been undertaken), total health expenditure was roughly $12.4 per capita, of
which government accounted for 25%, and donors for around 30%. Putting Malawi
Government and donor sources together, public funds accounted for 55% of health
expenditure, the total of which was estimated at US$123.9m or 7% of GDP. Private sources
accounted for the remaining 45%, of which more than half came from out—of—pocket

expenditures by households. A full breakdown of health financing by source is given in
Table 2.4 below.

2.3.3 The Government is the main source of recurrent health care expenditure in Malawi.
Although the budgetary allocation to the MOHP approved by Parliament has been rising, this
has not met the increasing needs of the health sector. In the past decade, economic difficulties
(devaluation and inﬂation) have led to a decline in the real value of health expenditure, both
from the recurrent budget and the GOM contribution to the development budget. Thus, the
expansion of the health infrastructure could no longer be maintained with adequate recurrent
spending and the budget is no longer sufficient for covering the needs of an ever—increasing
population.

2.3.4 The MOHP budget for FY 2002/03 was MK4.5bn, or 12.3% of total voted recurrent
and capital funding (Table 2.5). This compares with a figure of MK5.3 billion (15.1%) in FY
2001/02, and therefore represents both a decrease of 14% in nominal terms, and a reduced
share of the overall (voted) recurrent and capital budget. This is largely due to a fall in the
development budget, and in particular, the externally funded component, which was a result
of some donors that temporarily withdraw their support because of corruption and
misappropriation of public funds.

2.3.5 The GOM has recognized that the MOHP's finances are being increasingly stretched
by a continuing expansion in the demand for health services, associated primarily with
population growth, and the inability of the Treasury to support and sustain the needs of the
health sector. In response the Government adopted in the development plan (1999 — 2004)
several broad strategies as well as adopting a Programme of Work to be implemented on the
basis of a SWAp for financing an EHP to be made accessible to the population.

2.3.6 The Government made a policy decision that all services within the Essential Health
Package will be delivered free—of—charge. User fees are currently charged in CHAM
facilities, local government facilities, private facilities, and in paying outpatient departments
(known as OPDl) and wards in government hospitals (both district and central). Debate
continues as to how to handle the current policy of CHAM to charge for health services
within the EHP.

2.4 Maior Problems of the Sector

2.4.1 The health system throughout the country needs strengthening at all levels both in
terms of providing essential drugs and medical supplies as well as in reorienting the skills and
knowledge of health workers to address the challenges. In some instances a significant
proportion of the medical equipment is either in a state of disrepair or not available at all for
the delivery of essential health care. A number of health facilities need rehabilitation and
upgrading in order to be able to provide the full EHP. The introduction of a SWAp is seen as
a viable option to improve the health systems and services within finite resources, and as the
most appropriate way to cover the health needs of the poor.

2.4.2 With vacancies of the established posts up to 50% at some institutions, the health
sector is faced with a collapsing human resource capacity. Current training outputs in
Malawi are at levels too low to fill the large number of vacant posts for skilled health
workers. Most of the skilled health workers are leaving the public services mainly due to
poor salaries and working conditions. The HIV epidemic is also taking its toll on caregivers
and administrators alike, exacerbating an already chronic shortage of appropriately trained
personnel. There is, therefore, an urgent need to address the issue of human resources
through recruitment of more health workers, filling the vacant posts, and ensuring retention
of all trained health workers.

2.4.3 Poor implementation and management capacity both at the central and district levels
has hampered MOHP’s effort to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the limited
available resources. Government agrees with Development Partners that the principles
underpinning public procurement within the health SWAp are: transparency, efficiency and
economy, accountability, fair opportunity to all bidders, prevention of fraud, corruption and
other malpractices, however, procurement and financial systems in the MOHP and at district
levels are generally weak and the capacity is low. This will require technical and financial
assistance to help Government develop implementation systems and capacity of the MOHP in
areas such as budgeting, procurement, financial and human resources management.

2.4.4 The poor health status of the population is largely due to the underlying nutritional
and environmental problems. The situation is worsened by the high prevalence and incidence
of infectious and parasitic diseases, insufficient health care for women during pregnancy and
labour and inadequate family planning services. Furthermore, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has
assumed catastrophic proportions straining most of the limited resources of MOHP. It has
increased the cost of care and total health expenditure. The epidemic has increased the
burden to an already overloaded health services culminating in increased bed occupancy and
use of drugs and supplies. AIDS—related illnesses account for over 30% of all in—patients and
patients who are HIV sero—positive occupy nearly 65% of beds in hospitals. There is,
therefore, need to strengthen measures to mitigate the health and social impact of HIV/AIDS.

2.5 Activities of ADB and Other Donors

2.5.1 The Fund has to—date financed five interventions in the health sector in Malawi. The
Rural Health Care Project I was approved in 1981 for a loan of UA 7.37 million to finance
construction of two district hospitals (Salima and Mchinji) and two health centres
(Kaigwazanga and Mikundi) in the two districts. Rural Health Care Project II, was approved
in 1984 for a loan of UA 10.13 million to assist GOM to improve delivery of health care in
rural areas through construction of Ntchisi District Hospital and the BSON/MATS and
support to on—going communicable diseases programmes. The Health Sector Requirement
study (approved in 1997) assessed the health sector and proposed priority areas for the Bank’s
intervention in five districts (Salima, Ntchisi, Mchinji, Nkotakota and Phalombe). The Rural
Health Care Project III was approved in 2000 for a loan of UA 10.00 million to assist in
health facilities development, control of HIV/AIDS and capacity building. Implementation of
the first three interventions is successfully completed and the fourth one is on going and
progressing satisfactorily. Furthermore, the Support to the National HIV/AIDS Control
Programme, approved in December 1999 for a grant of UA 1.00 million, is close to
completion.

2.5.2 The GOM receives assistance, for the health sector, from several international
agencies. As government resources devoted to health continued to remain stagnant on a real
per capita basis in the early 1990s, donors played an important role in the financing capital
development and increasingly the delivery of health services. Table 2.6 shows that there is
now a sizable infusion of external assistance in the health sector following the temporary
withdrawal of support by some bilateral and multilateral donor agencies during the 2002 — 03
financial year.

3. THE SECTOR PROGRAMME
3.1 Sector -Wide Approach (SWAp)

3.1.1 As a means of seeking ways to substantially improve the overall management of the
health sector, the MOHP decided in 1999 to move away from a project approach to health
development towards a Sector—Wide Approach (SWAp). The SWAp was initiated in
response to persistent problems with project based development co—operation such as lack of
co—ordination, lack of ownership and low sustainability. The proposed SWAp will rationalize
scarce resources and maximize the efficient use of these resources in investing in the health
sector. It also commits Government and its Development Partners to undertake local capacity
building and systems development. The SWAp developed by the MOHP is anchored on the
Essential Health Package as derived from the National Health Plan to improve health service
delivery in Malawi. Its aim is to improve both the efficiency and equity of available
resources, and to mobilize additional resources.

3.1.2 Furthermore, MOHP decided to move away from the traditional project approach in
order to reduce the significant management time incurred by government in trying to meet the
individual demands of various stand alone projects. The required, but different reporting,
financial and procurement systems add to Govemment’s management burden. A number of
key steps have since been taken by the MOHP (and several of its development partners),
which have been of importance in laying the foundation for the SWAp. A list of key
documents (Annex IX) was prepared and a number of stakeholder workshops were held to
present and discuss the reports for the design of the SWAp.

3.1.3 The operational tool of the SWAp is the Programme of Work (POW) covering 2004 —
2010. It includes major areas of intervention under the SWAp. The implementation of the
activities will be based on Annual Work Plans (AWP) proposed by the districts and outlined
in the District Implementation Plans (DIP). The agreed content of DIPs consists of seven
objectives: (i) expand the range and quality of health services focused on maternal health and
children under the age of 5 years; (ii) improve the general status of the population by
strengthening, expanding and integrating relevant health services; (iii) increase access to
health care services; (iv) increase, retain and improve quality of trained human resources and
distribute them efficiently and equitably; (v) provide better quality health care in all facilities;
(vi) improve efficiency and equity in resource allocation; and (vii) strengthen collaboration.

3.2 Programme Objective

The programme objective is to establish through a SWAp arrangement, an effective
and efficient health care delivery system that is responsive to the needs of the people of
Malawi, especially the poor vulnerable groups, women and children.

3.3 Programme of Work (POW)

 

3.3.1 The POW is based on a prioritized but limited package of services that should be
available to every individual in Malawi. It comprises an EHP of eleven key components and
these cover those health services that address the major causes of death and diseases in
Malawi, together with the essential supporting structures and systems to enable delivery. In
addition, the POW has also been formulated taking into account various policy and planning
documents that guide the operations of the Ministry of Health and Population and the entire
sector. It will provide a basis for harmonization of departmental activities and work plans.

12

The POW shows how MOHP activities are, and will be organized on a phase—in basis for the
coming six years. It will be implemented on the basis of the SWAp arrangement guided and
governed by a code of conduct and Memorandum of Understanding amongst the
stakeholders.

3.3.2 The POW is divided into the six major programmes whose objectives and outputs are
described hereunder.

Program I : Human Resources Programme
3.3.3 The objective of this programme is to address the critical shortage of human resources
resulting from inadequate capacity of training institutions to produce the numbers of human
resources required to deliver the EHP. The proposed strategy revolves around the sound
implementation of the 6 year Emergency Pre—Service Training Plan for the sector, which
entails undertaken the following activities:

i) Financing adequate numbers of trained and skilled personnel for all health
facilities (including CHAM);
ii) Filling human resources vacancies, this will include the following:

I Implementing the 6 year emergency pre—service training plan;

I Financing the filling of human resources posts in line with the established
posts in GOM District and CHAM institutions;

I Financing a ﬂexible Technical Assistance Fund for specialists to cover non—
established staff needs at the district level; and

I Financing filling of posts at central hospital level in line with the
establishment.

iii) Strengthening human resources retention through payment of top up salaries and
paying salaries and allowances on time in GOM and CHAM health institutions;
and

iv) Providing in—service training to health workers.

Program 11 : Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies Programme

3.3.4 The objective of this program is to improve the quality of the EHP services through
strengthening national procurement, distribution and stock management systems for medical
and non—medical consumables. It will finance an adequate volume of pharmaceutical and
medical supplies at service delivery points (including CHAM). The outputs include
procurement of adequate pharmaceutical, medical and laboratory supplies for the EHP and
related services; strengthening delivery and storage of drugs and medical supplies at district
level, central hospitals and CHAM facilities; and providing storage and distribution costs at
all levels.

Program 111 : Essential Basic Equipment Programme

3.3.5 This program aims at ensuring that the health delivery system is appropriately
equipped with the necessary basic equipment according to the agreed standard list in support
of the delivery of the EHP at all levels of the health system. The program further provides for
the establishment of a preventive maintenance programme for equipment. Emphasis will be
on the provision of adequate funds for the procurement, maintenance and replacement of
equipment for district, health centre, central hospitals and CHAM institutions. The program
will cover financing functional essential medical Equipment (including CHAM); maintaining
equipment for EHP and related services in a functional state; and providing a capital budget
for equipment for EHP and related services at district, CHAM and central hospitals.

13

Program IV : Facilities Development Programme

3.3.6 The main objective of this program is to improve physical access to quality EHP
services through the rehabilitation and upgrading of health facilities, and training institutions.
Activities in this area will also include the rehabilitation and provision of additional units of
accommodation for staff at the various health facilities and the installation of plant
equipment. This will include upgrading of existing maternity units and dispensaries to health
center level, and rehabilitation of existing health facilities at GOM district level, CHAM,
tertiary and central hospitals in order to support the delivery of the full EHP services.

Program V : Routine Operations at Service Delivery Level Programme

3.3.7 The objective of this program is to ensure that there are adequate financial and
material resources to support the routine operations for delivering EHP and non—EHP services
within the MOHP and CHAM institutions. Under this section financial provisions will be
made for transport services; other services at district level (food and other provisions for
patients; consumables; routine supervision and support at sub—district level; strengthening
planning, budgeting and monitoring activities; outreach, Information, Education and
Communications and Behaviour Change Communication; support for DHMT activities —
management and community participation, and other routine activities for MOHP and central
hospitals.

Program VI : Central Operations, Policy and Systems Development
Programme

3.3.8 The aim of this programme is to enhance the MOHP’s capacity to formulate policy,
regulate the sector, coordinate the implementation of the Program of Work, monitor progress
and support the delivery of district level health services. The implementation of a SWAp will
require the institutionalization of new ways of conducting MOHP business and to strengthen
the analytic capacity of staff at headquarters to be able to effectively support a devolved
district health system. It is crucial to develop an appropriate service delivery system, which
includes technical support and supervision from the DHO to lower levels, referrals, and
enhanced integration of service delivery, procurement and financial management.

3.3.9 Central operations will, therefore, strengthen the role and ability of central institutions
to support implementation of the SWAp in delivering a full range of EHP and the
decentralization process in the health sector. The sub—component on policy and systems
development will focus on a number of activities including the following:

I Developing human resources managements system and standards;

I Establishing pharmaceutical and medical supplies management and development
systems;

I Putting in place policies and systems to ensure continuous availability of
functional essential equipment and infrastructure for the delivery of EHP;

I Developing and strengthening an effective and efficient financial management
system;

I Strengthening central and district level planning systems; and

I Implementing a sector wide health information system.

3.4 Annual Work Plans

As indicated in paragraph 3.1.3, the district health activities will be based on district
implementation plans. The planning process will be a bottom—up approach where

14

communities, health centers, district staff and other stake holders will be involved in the
preparation of Annual Work Plans (AWP). At the central level, Annual Work Programmes
will be prepared by the MOHP Departments. This process will involve the preparation of
detailed work plans, which will initially cover the financial year of the Programme of Work
(2004 — 2005). AWPs will be presented annually to the collaborating partners for review and
approval as well as ensuring commitment of resources to the funding of the programmes.

3.5 Programme Costs

Funding of the programmes under the POW will cost USD 735.00 million and will be
jointly financed by the Government and its Development Partners. Table 3.1 indicates an
overview of resource allocation for these programmes:

3.6 Financing the POW

3.6.1 Financing of the POW takes into account availability of potential resources and
absorptive capacity of the MOHP. Approximately USD 735 million will be required to
implement the POW over a period of 6 years or about an average of USD 10.3 per capita per
year. This amount includes the cost of EHP and non — EHP tertiary services. The majority of
finance for the POW will need to come from donors, and the proportion of donor finance in
the POW is expected to rise over time since fewer donors are likely to participate in the early
stages of the programme. Table 3.2 indicates the sources of financing for the programme. It
should be noted, however, that there is a possibility of making more than one financing
pledge during the POW period.

* This amount includes unpooled funds budgeted for in the POW.

15

3.6.2 The Bank Group will contribute a grant of UA 20.00 million (USD 30.10 million) to
support implementation of the POW. The total ADF contribution represents about 3.8% of
the total funding for the implementation of the six programmes. The resources will be
available for financing goods, works, services and operating costs of the said programmes.

3.6.3 At present, private finances are not included but efforts are underway to try to
integrate them into future POWs. Regulatory, licensing, supervisory and inspectorate
functions of the MOHP are still in development and these will be important if private sources
of finance are to contribute towards minimum standards of service quality. Other private
financing arrangements such as various insurance models are also underdeveloped.

3.7 Implementation Arrangements

3.7.1 The objective of the SWAp is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
health services. To this end, the implementation of the SWAp will strengthen and rationalize
existing systems rather than establish new or parallel systems. No Project Implementation
Unit will be established for the SWAp program. However, to help the MOHP’s Department
of Planning, which is taking the lead on SWAp—related work, a SWAp Secretariat is in the
process of being established to work under the leadership of the Director of Planning. The
SWAp Secretariat will be responsible for all the day—to—day SWAp related work. The
government and donors have agreed on the membership of the Secretariat and its
responsibilities as reﬂected in Annex 111.

3.7.2. Day to day implementation of the program will be through the regular departments of
the MOHP, CHAM, and other private health care providers, including Banja La Mtsogolo.
Oversight and coordination of the program will rest with the Principal Secretary of the
MOHP, working through two proposed Assistant Secretaries for Health, heads of technical
departments, finance, administration, etc. Similarly, CHAM activities will be implemented
through their existing structure of committees, which in turn work directly with the various
church organizations and health facilities. The provisions of the 2003 MOU between the
MOHP and CHAM will continue to apply.

3.7.3 The coordination of the implementation of the POW will be undertaken at two fora,
namely the Health Sector Review Group (HSRG) and donor sub—group on health. The HSRG
forum will meet quarterly and consist of directors of departments, heads of central hospitals,
collaborating Partners working in the health field, representatives of NGOs, private sector
providers of health, representatives of training institutions and civil society groups.

3.7.4 Given the emphasis being placed on decentralization and the magnitude of the funds
envisaged under the SWAp, financial management capacity at national and district levels will
need to be strengthed. GOM, CHAM and Development Partners are committed to making
swift progress in strengthening existing financial systems and the capacity of accounting
personnel through implementation of the Financial Management Improvement Plan (FMIP).
The FMIP includes the following key activities:

I Agreeing and implementing a revised structure of the Finance Department at
MOHP’s Headquarters;
' Agreeing and issuing detailed job descriptions to all finance staff;

16

I Purchasing and issuing Accountant General’s Desk Instructions to all finance
staff;

I Establishing a returns register;

I Establishing a Financial Management and Procurement Working Group to oversee
implementation of the FMIP;

I Ensuring that established posts at national and district level are filled;

I Undertaking introductory computer training for appropriate staff;

I Acquiring and implementing a computerized accounting system;

I Strengthening Management at CHAM;

I Developing and implementing a three year audit plan; and

I Recruiting long—term Technical Advisors to support the implementation of the
FMIP.

3.7.5 Three long—term technical assistants will be recruited to assist the MOHP implement
the FMIP and improve its management accounting, cash management, financial accounting
and audit functions. The technical assistants will also provide support to CHAM. The
Financial Management and Procurement Working Group will review progress against the
FMIP and provide written reports to the Senior Management Committee and the Health
Sector Review Group. The FMIP will be reviewed every six months and if necessary revised
by agreement within the Financial Management and Procurement Working Group.

3.7.6 The review of financial, technical and institutional progress in the sector will be on a
yearly basis, and agreement would be reached on the outputs and resource allocation for the
upcoming financial year. An overall sector performance assessment will be conducted.
Agreement will be reached on the way to improve the technical and institutional performance
of the sector.

3.7.7 The MOHP and the Development Partners, through the Joint Implementation Plan
Committee for Financing (JIP—Financing), will develop and agree upon formats and
guidelines for the process of accounting and auditing in accordance with the Government of
Malawi’s regulations. The Auditor General will audit the MOHP accounts once a year.
Where the Auditor General experiences capacity constraints, he may use external auditors to
audit the MOHP accounts. An external auditor will audit the MOHP accounts once during
the six—year period of the POW. The JIP Committee for Financing will determine the timing
for this audit. All partners and co—financiers will receive the annual audit reports carried out
by the Auditor General and the external auditors.

3.8 Funding Modalities

3.8.1 The six—year POW will be implemented adopting various funding modalities that will
be mutually agreed upon. The modalities intend to capture as many funding sources as
possible and shall neither exclude nor restrict contributions to the implementation of the
POW by Development Partners that have different funding mechanisms. It is anticipated that
all support will come under one or more of the funding modalities. The MOU provides
various modes of funding in order to accommodate specific financing requirements of
different donors.

3.8.2 The POW for the SWAp stipulates funding of USD 735 million to be contributed by
the Government and the donors for the period 2004 — 2010. Agreement has been made

between the MOHP and a core group of partners pooling all or at least a part of their
resources in the basket fund (ADF, DFID, NORAD, World Bank and WHO) to use common

17

implementation arrangements for planning and budgeting including procurement, financial
management and technical assistance. It should be noted however, that the USD 735 includes
unpooled funds, which Government is looking forward to being reprogrammed to basket
funding. In the meantime, it is possible for a donor in the pool to also fund outside the pool
and for other donors outside the pool to fund the programme using separate projects and
earmarked funds (that is currently the case for WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, USAID, JICA,
GTZ).

3.9 Mechanisms for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the POW

3.9.1 The Programme of Work shall be monitored through the Annual Joint Reviews and
Joint Implementation Plan subcommittees. The MOHP will take the lead in reviewing health
sector performance on a regular basis. This forum will help both the MOHP and
Development Partners to assess how effectively the Programme of Work is being
implemented, what progress is being made towards agreed outputs and how efficiently the
inputs provided are being utilized. Much of the work of the review will be conducted in two
committees: Joint Implementation Plan Committee of SWAp and Financing Committee.

3.9.2 Sector performance will be monitored and reviewed against milestones and targets
established on the basis of availability of data to monitor the progress in the implementation
of the POW. Indicators will facilitate the monitoring of inputs, the processes, the outputs and
impact on the POW. To the extent possible, baseline data for indicators and monitoring will
be made available. Where this baseline information is not available studies will either be
conducted or planned as early as possible in the initial phase of the POW.

3.9.3 A set of indicators has been put in place for measuring the performance of the health
sector (ANNEX V). It will, of course, be important to specify baseline values and targets for
achievement and, where possible, targets for under—served populations (such as those living in
rural areas or specific geographical areas, or by gender or socio—economic status). While
acknowledging MOHP's central role in determining priorities and resource allocations, the
setting of targets should be a collaborative exercise involving MOHP, development partners,
non—government providers and civil society organizations. By achieving consensus on the
aims of the POW, there will be greater prospects of genuine commitment from all partners to
making the POW a success.

3.9.4 The MOHP has made substantial progress in establishing information systems across
several areas including health service activities, morbidity and mortality, drugs and medical
supplies, facilities and equipment (inventory of health facilities), finances and human
resources. However, many of these systems are embryonic and they will need continued
development and support. For example, the HMIS was only introduced in January 2002 and,
while it is furnishing useful information, there is scope to strengthen data management
procedures (including training of health facility staff, follow up of missing reports, data
quality control), analysis, dissemination and use. It is likely that further technical assistance;
supervision and training will be required before systems are fully embedded. Malawi also
has recourse to periodic household surveys notably the Demographic Health Survey (DHS).
The DHS, which is in progress should provide a baseline for several indicators of relevance
to the POW as well as a means to verify the accuracy of HMIS data.

4. ADF SUPPORT TO THE PROGRAMME

4.1 Concept and Rationale

4.1.1 The ADF support was designed in collaboration with other development partners and
stakeholders to enhance government’s effort to achieve sustainable poverty reduction and to
meet the health MDGs through implementation of the POW under a health sector wide
approach. To improve the overall efficiency of investment in the health sector, the
government decided to move away from the traditional project approach to a SWAp in order
to harmonize donor support and ensure a more targeted and equitable delivery of health
services. This approach is intended to improve efficiency and equity in available resources.
Furthermore, the Local Government Act, which was recently passed, provides the necessary
legal framework for the decentralization policy, which will facilitate community participation
in health planning and decision making i.e. democratic structures for poor people to
participate in their own development.

4.1.2 Although some progress has been made in addressing some of the challenges outlined
in the NHP (1999 — 2004) a lot more still needs to be done. The programme will be part of a
concerted effort by the development partners to the funding of the POW. The proposed ADF
Support will contribute through pooled funding to the six programmes listed hereunder: (i)
Human Resources; (ii) Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies; (iii) Essential Basic Equipment;
(iv) Facilities Development; (v) Routine Operations at Service Delivery Level; and (vi)
Central Operations, Policy and Systems Development. In line with Section 4.2 under item
“Policies and Procedures” of the Guidelines for the Bank Group Operations Using Sector
Wide Approaches (SWAps), it is recommended that the Board approve a waiver on the
application of the “rule of origin,” “pooling of resources” and “rule on replenishment for the
special account.”

4.1.3 The proposed programme conforms with the Guidelines for Bank Group Operations
using Sector—Wide Approaches (2004), the Bank Group's Health Sector Policy which seeks to
improve access to quality health care and the Bank Group’s harmonization efforts to reduce
transaction costs of development assistance, improve the effectiveness, and efficiency of aid
delivery and management. It is also in line with the lending strategy for Malawi, which seeks
to alleviate poverty through strong and more equitable growth and improved health status of
the population. The poorest and those living in the most remote areas contribute
disproportionately to the burden of disease. Consequently, to reduce the burden of disease the
programme is designed to strengthen the provision of health care to benefit the poorest and most
marginalized people.

4.1.4 The programme is also in line with the Govemment’s Poverty Alleviation Programme
in which the health sector has been identified as one of the key sectors for the reduction of
poverty. It has a focus on poverty reduction as it seeks to reduce morbidity and mortality
risks associated largely with poorer Malawian households. The programme will contribute to
Government’s overall policy goal of the health sector, as stated in the National Health Plan
(1999 — 2004), which has been extended through the POW to cover the period 2004 — 2010.
The programme also supports the thrusts of the Bank Group’s Updated 2002 — 04 Country
Strategy for Malawi and focuses on improving access to quality primary health care for the
rural populations.

19

Lessons Learned

4.1.5 The design of the proposed ADF Support has taken into account a number of major
lessons learned from the previous five Bank Group interventions in the health sector. This
includes delays in project implementation due to the low capacity of the executing agency,
the lack of government ownership in the traditional project approach, the need to align
expansion of health infrastructure with the required staffing levels and drugs, and lack of
capacity to monitor and evaluate project outcomes. As indicated above, the design of the
POW and SWAp is based on government led strategy intended to strengthen local capacity at
both central and district levels. GOM and the Development Partners acknowledge the need
for clear leadership by the MOHP in the provision of health services. The POW and SWAp
will ensure availability of adequate drugs and staff in the health facilities. It will also enable
the MOHP to move away from the individual reviews by various donors to a more
coordinated way of monitoring and evaluating performance based on an agreed set of
indicators.

4.2 Programme Area and Beneﬁciaries

4.2.1 Malawi is a landlocked country with a total population of about 12 million of which
86% are rural and 14% are urban dwellers. The total median age is 16.4 years whilst it is
16.1 years and 16.7 years for males and females respectively. The POW covers the whole
nation and the main beneficiaries will be people living in the rural areas. Five of the six
programmes of the POW will cover services offered throughout the 27 districts of Malawi.
Whilst the 6th programme, namely, the Central Operations, Policy and Systems Development
is aimed at strengthening the central MOHP’s capacity to support implementation of the
SWAp in delivering the EHP and decentralization of the health sector. The provision of EHP
will address the important health needs of the vulnerable groups, the poor, women and
children, a greater proportion of them being in the rural areas.

4.2.2 Surveys into the impact of poverty in Malawi have shown that women and female—
headed households are the poor of the poorest. Although the Government recognizes the
need for equal participation by both men and women in economic and social development;
this has not been put into practice at the household level due to a number of social and
cultural factors that continue to perpetuate gender disparities. Culturally, men are assigned
leadership roles and women are expected to play a subordinate role. Women are under
represented at political, policy and decision—making levels. Out of the twenty—five cabinet
ministers twenty—four are men and one is a woman. Gross enrolment ratio between girls and
boys at primary level is about 1 — l, but the dropout rate is much higher for girls than boys in
upper grades. Girls constitute 25% of the students in the final year of primary school.

4.2.3 Poor maternal health, sexually transmitted diseases and limited access to family
planning services are putting a sizable burden of ill health on poor women. The HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate among the 15 — 49 age group is also estimated to be 5 times higher in women
than in men. The subordinate role—played by women in decision—making and control of
financial resources is one of the major contributing factors putting a sizable burden of ill
health women since they have no direct control over issues affecting their own health. GOM
has started addressing the issue gender disparities by developing guidelines on gender
mainstreaming, implementing a programme against violence on women and changing rules
on inheritance to protect adequately the interest of women.

20

4.3 Strategic Context

4.3.1 The proposed programme will contribute to achieving the health sector’s goal of
raising the level of health status of all Malawians by reducing the incidence of illness and
occurrence of premature deaths through funding of some of the priority areas established
within the POW for the implementation of the EHP. The programme will address major
problems identified in the sector, namely poor distribution of resources, scarcity of human
resources, poor management capacity, and high prevalence and incidence of diseases. To
improve the health situation of the poor in the rural areas, the programme will improve access
to rural health services by improving the infrastructure, provision of drugs and strengthening
district health systems.

4.3.2 The programme will also contribute to GOM efforts to reach the MDGs by providing
more resources to reduce child mortality, maternal mortality, and halting the spread of major
diseases, malaria, HIV/AIDS, etc. Current assessments carried out by the World Bank
indicate that Malawi is unlikely to meet the MDGs of (i) eradicating extreme poverty, (ii)
reducing child mortality, (iii) improving maternal health, (iv) combating HIV/AIDS, malaria
and other diseases, (v) ensuring environmental sustainability by 2015. However, Malawi will
likely achieve the MDG of universal primary education by 2015 and may also possibly meet
the goal of achieving gender equality in education by 2015. Progress towards meeting the
MDGs hinges on effective implementation of the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy, a
process to which the Government is committed. The Bank Group’s strategy aims at helping
Malawi move forward on the goal of eradicating extreme poverty.

4.4 Objective

The objective of the ADF support is to finance goods, works and services needed for
the establishment of an effective and efficient health care delivery system that is responsive
to the needs of the people of Malawi.

4.5 Programme Description

ADF’s contribution over a period of 42 months will support implementation of the six
programmes whose objectives and outputs are as described in paragraph 3.3.2. above.

4.6 Environmental Impact

As the programme includes rehabilitation of existing health infrastructures, it has been
classified in Category 11 according to the Bank’s environmental guidelines. The programme
will have a minimal negative impact on the environment since most of the construction work
to be done will consist of one—storey buildings. Principles of environmental protection will
be observed in the civil works in terms of preserving existing trees and planting new ones.
Where there is no existing water supply, the construction of boreholes has been proposed to
ensure the availability of good quality water required for the regular cleaning of the facility.
With regards to the disposal of human waste, the ventilated improved pit latrines (VIP) will
replace the existing foul smelling pit latrines. Hand wash facilities and bucket showers will
be provided to enhance the personal hygiene of patients and health centre personnel.
Awareness lessons on the implementation of the proposed mitigative measures will be
provided to the medical staff and laboratory technicians.

21

5 IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the POW will be based on Annual Work Plans, to be
submitted in May every year, based on activities outlined in the District Implementation
Plans (DIPs) and Annual Work Programs for central MOHP Departments. This process will
involve the preparation of detailed work plans, which will initially cover the first financial
year of the Programme of Work (2004—2005). Subsequently, annual work plans will roll over
and follow the financial year and the planning cycle of the MOHP. The content of the annual
work plans will, amongst other things include detailed activities to be implemented as part of
the six main components of the POW; indicators for inputs and the achievement of outputs
and objectives; assignment of responsibilities for implementation of activities; and detailed
budgets indicating inputs from national partner(s).

5.1 Executing Agency

The MOHP will be the executing agency for the programme. As indicated in
paragraph 3.7.1, no Project Implementation Unit will be established. The SWAp Secretariat
in the Department of Planning of the MOHP will deal mainly with the donors, monitoring
and evaluation as well as facilitating implementation of all the activities under the POW. The
MOHP does not have adequate capacity to implement or coordinate and supervise the
proposed activities. It is for this reason that the MOHP and SWAp Secretariat in particular,
will be strengthened through recruitment of four technical assistants namely, experts in
monitoring and evaluation, procurement, financial management and human resources
development. Day to day implementation of programme activities shall be the responsibility
of the technical departments and units.

5.2 Institutional Arrangements

 

5.2.1 The Principal Secretary in the MOHP is responsible for the overall implementation of
the POW through the SWAp arrangement. Implementation of the SWAp will be coordinated
through various committees with management and advisory responsibilities as outlined in
Annex II. The roles and responsibilities of the various committees including the Top
Management Committee, Senior Management Committee, Health Sector Review Group,
Technical Working Group etc. are detailed in Annex III

5.2.2 The heads of the different departments of the MOHP will be directly responsible for
the implementation of the activities under the programmes. The SWAp Secretariat located in
the planning department will coordinate the tracking and monitoring of progress in line with
agreed indicators; financial monitoring and reporting for the POW; the activities of and
support by all stakeholders; and adherence to the provisions of the MOU and Code of
Conduct. It will make the necessary preparations for the Joint Review Process in conjunction
with the proposed Joint Review Committee, and coordinate the production of the Annual
Sector Review Report for the Sector.

5.2.3 The monitoring and evaluation of programme activities, including implementation
progress and expenditure will be the responsibility of the MOHP as a regular management
function through the SWAp Secretariat. The SWAp Secretariat will submit mid—year
Program Review Reports on the accounts and activities of the POW by 15 March each year.
The mid—year Program Review Reports will be submitted to the TMC, the Senior
Management Committee and the HSRG, and will contain information on programmes/sub—
programmes by: objective, activities, targets, budget, source of funding, planned versus actual

22

outputs, expenditure, and variance on expenditure using a format to be developed and agreed
to by all partners. The main focus of the mid—year Program Review will be on overall SWAp
progress, more and especially on technical matters. The Fund will closely monitor the
implementation of the POW through participation in these reviews.

5.3 Implementation and Supervision Schedules

The activities under the programme will be implemented over 3.5 years (42 months)
from effectiveness of the grant. Joint review missions will be undertaken twice a year. The
implementation schedule is presented in Annex X.

5.4 Procurement Arrangements

5.4.1 The proposed procurement arrangements for the SWAp (Basket or pool funds) are
summarized in Table 5.1 below. All procurement below the prior review thresholds shall be
in accordance with procedures set forth in Public Procurement Act of 2003. This Act was
reviewed by the Fund and found to be in line with the Bank Group’s Rules of Procedure for
Procurement of Goods and Works, and for the Use of Consultants. The Act will be
supplemented by regulations, desk manuals and other procurement documents. For NCB,
until national standard bidding documents satisfactory to the Pool Fund Partners are
developed, World Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents (SBD), with modifications as
appropriate, shall be used. As reﬂected in paragraph 4.1.2 above, it is recommended that the
Board approve a waiver for the rule of origin of goods, works and services. The Executing
Agency will be responsible for procurement of goods, works and acquisition of consulting
services financed under the programme.

5.4.2 For all procurements requiring prior review the Pool Fund Partners have agreed that
the World Bank will review and provide the no objection on behalf of the partners because
they have the capacity at the country office level. The Development Partners and/ or
independent auditors will carry out Procurement Post Reviews (PPRs) annually. Based on
the findings of the reviews, the prior review thresholds will be reviewed by the Collaborating
Partners in consultation with the Directorate of Public Procurement, on an annual basis.

* All contracts under direct contracting will be subject to prior review

5.4.3 By May 15 each year, the MOHP will submit to the Collaborating Partners for review
and agreement Annual Procurement Plans. The plans will define the methods of procurement
in line with the Procurement Procedure Manuals. Any subsequent revisions to the Annual
Procurement Plan will require concurrence of the Collaborating Partners. Detailed
procedures for procurement are shown Annex VIII.

5.4.4 In order to strengthen the procurement capacity of the MOHP, a Procurement
Improvement Action Plan has been agreed between GOM and the Development Partners. A
procurement unit will be established in the MOHP, comprising a long—term advisor and two
members of staff from the MOHP, which is a requirement under the agreement reached with
collaborating partners. The Procurement Improvement Action Plan includes the following
key activities:

' Establishment of specialised procurement units at all cost centres in line with the
requirements of the Public Procurement Act of 2003;

' Ensuring that established procurement posts are prioritised and progressively
filled in the ministry and at district level;

I Identifying training needs and developing a time bound training strategy;

I Developing health sector procurement systems and procedures,
procurement plans and sector specific standard bidding documents;

annual

 

24

' Developing and implementing a drugs and medical supplies procurement,
distribution and management improvement plan at central, district and local
levels;

I Recruitment of long term Technical Assistants to develop and support the
implementation of the Procurement Improvement Action Plan including
monitoring, mentoring and capacity building responsibilities of procurement staff
of the MOHP;

I Appointing an independent external procurement auditor; and

' Establishing a financial management and procurement improvement monitoring
working group to oversee the implementation of the Procurement Improvement
Action Plan.

5.5 Disbursement Arrangements

5.5.1 In line with the chart showing flow of funds for SWAp in Annex IV, contributions
from the Bank Group will be disbursed quarterly using the special account method, into the
pooled donors forex account held in the Reserve Bank of Malawi. The disbursements will be
based on transfers of Annual Work Plans reviewed and approved by the development
partners. Funds from the pooled donors forex account will be transferred on the advice of the
MOHP through the Ministry of Finance into the Malawi Kwacha holding account. This
account will be used to make payments to CHAM, MOHP and district cost centers.

5.5.2 All supporting documents will be initiated and kept by the SWAp Secretariat for
review by the auditors and the joint review missions.

5.6 Monitoring and Evaluation

5.6.1 As indicated in paragraph 3.9, the monitoring and evaluation framework for the POW
will be based on the SWAp principle of annual joint reviews involving all the stakeholders.
The premise of the monitoring framework is that there is consensus between development
partners and the government on targets, choice of indicators and systems to monitor progress.
A set of indicators has been put in place for measuring the performance of the health sector
(ANNEX V). The strategy emphasizes the use of indicators already being collected by the
routine health statistics and complemented, in some instances, by the collection of additional
information. Critical at the beginning of the SWAp process will be the use of process
indicators to measure whether actions set out in the work program have been completed on
time and possibly whether completed within the budget. As outcome indicators respond
rather slowly to health sector improvement, reliance will be placed on service quality and
output indicators as proxies for whether the objective of the programme is achieved.

5.6.2 When the grant is fully disbursed and the programme has come to an end, the
Secretariat will prepare and send to the Fund, a Programme Completion Report (PCR)
indicating costs, benefits, achievements, and lessons learned. A PCR would also be prepared
by ADF after the programme ends so as to evaluate the potential impact of the programme
and the lessons learned from its implementation.

5.7 Financial Reports and Auditing

5.7.1 The Executing Agency will maintain the accounts by programme outputs and source
of funding and put in place a system of internal control to ensure prompt recording of
transactions, timely production of accounts and reports and safeguard the MOHP assets.

25

Financial records will be maintained in accordance with internationally acceptable accounting
procedures. The Secretariat will prepare monthly financial statements that will be
consolidated by them into mid—year Program Review Reports to be included as a section of
the mid—year Program Review Report.

5.7.2 The Auditor General has the mandate under the Public Audit Act 2003 to
independently audit all financial statements, records and books of accounts under the SWAp.
Where the Auditor General experiences capacity constraints, he may direct the engagement
of a private firm to audit any financial records, books of accounts and financial statements of
the MOHP. Audited accounts will be submitted to all donors within six months after the end
of the financial year.

5.8 Aid Co-ordination

5.8.1 The preparation of the POW was a joint effort of the MOHP and collaborating
partners. The report on ADF’s support to the implementation of the POW is based on the
outcome of joint identification, preparation appraisal and post—appraisal missions undertaken
with the World Bank and other collaborating partners. The ADF took part in these missions
and shared with other development partners the design and proposed implementation
arrangements of the programme.

5.8.2 As indicated in paragraph 3.7.3 coordination of the implementation of the POW will
be undertaken at two fora, namely the Health Sector Review Group (HSRG) and donor sub—
group on health. The terms of reference of the HSRG include reviewing progress in the
implementation of the Program of Work, sector priorities, and budget considerations in order
to support and reach a consensus; undertake advocacy for the sector; and resolve the
disagreements between the partners within 30 (thirty) days. The donor sub—group will
include partners represented in Malawi and will undertake monthly consultation meetings in
order to monitor the progress in the implementation of the POW.

5.8.3 The SWAp Secretariat will ensure coordination of all the activities under the SWAp.
Annual joint reviews will be undertaken by the Government and contributing partners to the
implementation of the POW. Annual Work Programmes will be determined jointly. The Bank
will ensure to take part in the joint reviews with the other partners.

6. PROGRAMME SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
6.1 Recurrent Cost

6.1.1 ADF’s support is an integral part of the POW that will be implemented through a
SWAp arrangement and jointly financed with GOM and other development partners. The
Government and the collaborating partners, with the view to keeping the recurrent cost
implications to a minimum, endorsed all the interventions in the POW. The main activity in
the POW that will require substantial recurrent costs is recruitment of health workers to fill
the large numbers of established vacant posts and the added benefits to retain staff. The cost
for recruitment and measures to reduce long—term financial implications by engaging those
who left the civil service on short—term basis were taken into account in the design of POW.

26

6.1.2 Annual Work Plans to be approved by collaborating partners will equally include
recurrent costs. This effectively ensures that the recurrent costs are taken into account. In
addition to the above measures for curtailing recurrent costs, the programme suggests that at
least for the near future, civil works will be confined to renovations and small upgrading of
existing facilities. In this regard, the major activities of the programme will involve provision
of drugs and supplies, development of infrastructure, and strengthening of health systems,
which are catered under the current budget. Malawi also receives Heavily Indebted Poor
Country funds that are in part channeled to the MOHP.

6.2 Programme Sustainability

6.2.1 The sustainability of the POW will be determined by two key elements, ownership
and the availability of financial resources (including donor funds). Moving away from the
project approach to SWAp will in itself enhance sustainability through efficient and effective
use of human and financial resources. The key to ensure sustainability of the programme also
lies in the ability of the Government to engender ownership by the communities (i.e. districts)
where the activities will be implemented. The districts will include their proposals in the
district plans, which will be incorporated in the Annual Work Plan. All the activities under
the programme will be closely implemented in collaboration with the District Health Officer
as well as with the communities in the catchment area. The DHO will ensure mobilisation of
the communities and facilitate their involvement in the planning, management of the services.
This will encourage the community members to use the facilities in a responsible manner,
help to make the health workers more accountable to the community and contribute to
sustainability of the programme.

6.2.2 The POW emphasizes the need to strengthen management capacity of district health
offices. Periodic supervision and monitoring by the DHO will ensure sustainability in the
provision of quality services. The skills of the staff at both district level and health centres
will be enhanced. This will enable them to facilitate sustainability in the management,
prevention and control of priority public health problems. All the activities for the POW
were jointly agreed (partners and GOM) and similarly Annual Work Plans will be jointly
approved. More effective planning and management of health resources and services will
increase technical efficiency and cost—effectiveness which will result in the containment of
recurrent costs since the activities will be approved in the Annual Work Plan. Routinely
maintained health infrastructure, medical and communication equipment will be another key
determinant to sustainability of the programme.

6.2.3 Availability of resources, both Government and donor, will contribute to the
sustainability of the POW. Donor support represents about 70% to the financing of the POW.
This mainly depends on the willingness and capacity of the MOHP to maintain and further
improve the financial management system and the policy dialogue mechanisms that have
been put in place in SWAp.

6.3 Assumptions and Critical Risks

6.3.1 It is assumed that GOM will maintain its commitment to the POW for SWAp and that
the donor community continues to support the SWAp at the same level for the near future.
Over the years, the share of the budgetary allocations for health has been rising in nominal
terms but the growth has been marginal in real terms. Furthermore, the annual average
growth of the Government’s contribution to the sector in absolute terms is a reﬂection of its
commitment towards supporting the implementation of the POW. Government has also

27

embarked on aggressive mobilization of financial resources with development partners.
Moreover, Government has committed itself to increasing public financing of the health
sector. Hence, it is very likely that GOM will be able to meet its counterpart funding
obligations and to provide for the recurrent health care for preventive and curative services.
The donor community equally having been part of the development of the SWAp
arrangements has shown commitment to financing and sustaining the POW.

6.3.2 It is also assumed that health personnel will use training to improve the quality of
health care delivery. Of course, failure of the health workers to appropriately utilize their
newly acquired skills or disseminate correct health information and messages may jeopardize
the outcome of the programme. In order to minimize this risk, the planning and management
capability at the district is a continuous process in the POW, which will also be
complemented under the proposed programme. This will equip the DHO with appropriate
supervision and monitoring skills to ensure quality control, compliance and effective
utilization of upgraded skills. This will be supported with monitoring activities of the zonal
offices and national programme officers. Similarly, adequate communication, equipment and
supplies combined with periodic joint supervisions, SWAP secretariat, national and zonal
level will ensure that DHOs effectively serve outreach areas and disseminate information on
EHP.

6.3.3 There are risks associated with the weak implementation capacity of the MOHP at
national and district levels, and timely implementation of the programme, delivery of goods
on schedule and according to budgetary provision. In order to mitigate these risks, a SWAp
Secretariat will be established to support and facilitate the implementation of the POW.
SWAp offers an opportunity to undertake massive training efforts to provide procurement
and financial management skills to responsible staff at national and district levels.
Recruitment of technical assistants in financial management, procurement, human resources
development, and monitoring and evaluation to strengthen implementation of POW is also in
progress. Furthermore, DFID has signed a separate £100 million grant for salary top—ups as a
means to ensure retention of health workers.

6.3.4 Political instability due to the strong anti—corruption drive by the current President of
Malawi may affect implementation of the POW. It should be noted, however, that since the
President resigned from the ruling party due to his anti—corruption stand, a number of cabinet
ministers and MPs have pledged their loyalty to working with him. SWAp will mitigate
corruption by putting in place efficient and transparent financial management and
procurement systems. Recruitment of long—term technical assistants to set up such systems is
in progress. Furthermore, Terms of Reference for ADF staff attending Joint Review
meetings will include an assessment of transparency and accountability in the use of
programme funds. It is also anticipated that the opening of a Bank Group Country Office in
2006 and the recently approved Support for Good Governance Project will help in improving
fiduciary standards.

7. PROGRAMME BENEFITS

Social Impact

7.1 While there are a number of possible risks in the implementation of the POW, Malawi
has the potential for making progress towards achieving the health MDGs with support from
its Development Partners. Advances in health status will contribute towards poverty
reduction, and therefore, the programme benefits outweigh potential risks. Implementation of

28

the POW through a SWAp arrangement will stimulate participation of users and civil society
in planning, decision—making and monitoring of health facilities. The SWAp offers the
opportunity for strengthening institutions to improve targeting and focus of resource
allocation and activities, accessibility and relevance of health services delivery to the needs of
the vulnerable groups, the poor, women and children, a greater proportion of whom are in
rural areas. The provision of targeted EHP will lead to an improved health status of the poor
population, which in turn will improve their productivity.

7.2 The reduction of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality requires effective and
immediate access to skilled assistance in childbirth and easy access to referral facilities for
complications, such as those requiring caesarian sections. In Malawi, it is estimated that
about 45% of deliveries are taking place outside the health facilities. With improved access
and utilization of these services by pregnant women, it is expected that this proportion would
be reduced and infant and maternal mortality would be reduced as well. It is anticipated that
the current maternal mortality rate of 1,120 deaths per 100,000 live births will be reduced
significantly to 600 deaths per 100,000 live births. Infant and under five mortality rates of
104 and 189 per 1,000 live births are expected to go down to 70 and 120 per 1,000 live births
respectively.

7.3 Ensuring that EHP interventions reach women will strengthen the possibility of
meeting poverty reduction objectives and MDG targets. For example, HIV/AIDS has
reversed decades of improvements in life expectancy to the current 39 years; left thousands of
children orphaned and eroded the quality of health services by straining the limited resources
in the MOHP. However, sufficiently empowering women to improve their health through
implementation of EHP will contribute in reversing this trend. The POW also covers
provision of drugs and equipment, infrastructure development, and strengthening the health
systems all of which are bound to have a positive social impact.

7.4 Furthermore, the EHP provides a limited but effective range of priority services that
will be given to all individual Malawians free of charge at the point of delivery. Removal of
financial barriers to the provision of health services will ensure accessibility to quality health
care for all. This will also have a significant social impact on the health status of the
disadvantaged population. Decentralization and community participation in planning and
delivery of health interventions will also enhance the capacity of the health sector to reach the
poor and vulnerable populations.

Economic Impact

7.5 The programme is complementary to the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
which gives utmost attention to needs of the poor. Provision of training and procurement of
medical equipment and supplies under the programme will strengthen the skills of the staff,
improve diagnostic procedures and treatment, and strengthen the IEC activities with respect
to cost—effective interventions that will have major impact on the reduction of disability and
absenteeism due to the major diseases in rural remote areas. Reduction of the high morbidity
rate due to easily preventable diseases will result in higher productivity. The programme will
have a positive impact on the economic well—being of families living in rural areas by
lowering costs of treatment and demands on family members to provide support to the sick.

7.6 The strengthening of the management capacity of the districts and the establishment
of health information system for monitoring activities will result in the effective utilization of
the limited available resources. There will be gains in efficiency due to better coordination

29

through SWAp. The programme will ensure supply of drugs to the health facilities in stead of
the patients purchasing these items elsewhere. During the period of construction and
procurement of the supplies, the programme is anticipated to create employment
opportunities to the communities in the surrounding areas.

8. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8. 1 Conclusion

The proposed programme to be implemented through SWAp offers an opportunity for
the development of management systems by the MOHP and its Development Partners to
facilitate the introduction of common arrangements for disbursement and accounting of
funds, procurement and the monitoring of sector performance. ADF’s contribution channeled
through basket funding will enhance Govemment’s potential towards achieving the health
MDGs and poverty reduction. The programme will facilitate access of rural population to the
Essential Health Package. In this regard, and in line with Section 4.2 under item “Policies and
Procedures” of the Guidelines for the Bank Group Operations Using Sector Wide Approaches
(SWAps), it is recommended that the Board approve a waiver on the application of the “rule
of origin,” “pooling of resources” and “rule on replenishment for the special account.” The
proposed programme will complement the support of other donors for capacity building,
provision of drugs and establish a health care delivery system that is responsive to the needs
of the people of Malawi.

8.2 Recommendations and conditions for grant approval
It is recommended that the Fund consider extending an ADF grant not exceeding the

sum of UA 20.00 million to the Government of Malawi as described in this proposal, subject
to the following conditions:

PROCUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES

 

In order to ensure proper management of the procurement function in accordance with the principles
underpinning public procurement within the health SWAp i.e. transparency, efficiency and economy;
accountability; fair opportunity to all bidders; prevention of fraud; corruption and other malpractices;
and promotion of local capacity the Government and Pool Fund partners are committed to ensuring
that:

1. A Procurement Plan for the initial 12 months of the SWAp, has been prepared by MOHP for
agreement with Pool Fund partners. This plan will include cost estimates, method of procurement,
prior review thresholds, key milestone dates, and time-bound capacity building activities for
implementing agencies.

2. Thereafter by May 15‘h of each year, the Government will provide the Pool Fund partners for their
review and concurrence a draft Annual Procurement Plan, which will include on-going contracts
rolling into the following year, and detailed procurement plans for the following year prepared at
district and national levels based on the agreed Program of Work. The Procurement Plan will be
agreed between Government and Pool Fund partners by June 30 of each year. Any subsequent
revisions to the annual Procurement Plan will require concurrence of the Pool Fund partners.

3. During implementation of the Procurement Plan, the Government will provide the Pool Fund
partners with quarterly procurement monitoring reports concerning progress in implementation of the
Procurement Plan and identifying any contracts that were not included in the Procurement Plan
adopted the preceding year. The Government and Pool Fund partners will provide information to
other Pool Fund partners concerning the award of contracts and appointment of consultants, and any
material modifications of the terms and conditions of such contracts after their award.

4. The Pool Fund partners reserve the right to appoint a representative to each of the Internal
Procurement Committees (IPCs) for the Ministry of Health and the Central Medical Stores. The
representatives will also have full access to district level IPCs. The representatives will have full and
unrestricted access to all documentation relevant to the workings and decision-making of the IPCs.

5. By June 30 of each year, the Government will appoint an independent agent to review the
procurement that took place during the preceding year. The Pool Fund partners will agree upon the
scope and Terms of Reference of this Procurement Audit and criteria for selection of agents. The
procurement audit will be completed and a report submitted to Government by December 31st of each
year. While procurement audits would normally be conducted annually, should particular concerns be
identified, any Pool Fund partner may request that a special procurement audit be conducted, or may
send additional procurement missions to the field for further post reviews or investigations. The
conclusions of any such missions will be shared with the Government and among Pool Fund partners.

6. The findings of the annual procurement audit will be provided to all Pool Fund partners and the
Government by January 30 of each year. Pool Fund partners will provide their comments by February
28. The Government will by March 31 provide the Pool Fund partners with a proposed plan of action
to correct any anomalies and errors identified in the procurement audit or review. Taking comments
of the Pool Fund partners into account, the Government will implement its plan of action in
accordance with a schedule agreed with the Pool Fund partners.

7 Should cases of mis-procurement occur, each Pool Fund partner may take actions established in its
own guidelines, and any Pool Fund partner may decide, after consultation with Government and other
Pool Fund partners, to cancel from its respective financing an amount equivalent to the contract
amount multiplied by its proportional contribution to the SWAp pooled fund.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLANSUMMARY

Support to the Health Sector Programme

Programme No.: Country: Malawi
Department: ONSD Division: ONSD.2
(a) Brief description of the programme and key environmental and social components:

(b)

(C)

(d)

(9)

Implementation of the six programmes of the POW will cover (i) Human Resources;
(ii) Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies; (iii) Essential Basic Equipment; (iv)
Facilities Development; (v) Routine Operations at Service Delivery Level; and (vi)
Central Operations, Policy and Systems Development Programme

Facilities development through, rehabilitation and upgrading of existing rural health
centres, maternity units and dispensaries, construction of VIP latrines and equipping
the health centres with basic utility systems (water, electricity and
telecommunications)

Major environmental and social impacts:

Renovation and construction at the existing sites will affect some health facility
structures.

Also potentially affected will be the existing grounds, with existing plant material.
Improved hygiene and health through safer water and waste management.

New drugs storage facilities, laboratories and normal medical functions will generate
potentially dangerous medical and other waste.

Enhancement and mitigation programme:

The construction programme at the health centres will restore buildings to a high
standard, while changing their functionalities.

Since all construction is at existing sites, there is no concern regarding incursion into
natural woodlands or waterways. The tender documents governing construction will
stipulate the maintenance and enhancement of the vegetation in the existing green
areas, making them more accessible and useful to patients, staff and visitors.

Tender documents will provide for waste management systems which separate waste
for proper disposal or recycling.

Monitoring programme and complementary initiatives:

The MOHP will ensure that construction tender documents safeguard all buildings at
the existing sites, and that the existing landscaped grounds are protected and
enhanced.

Institutional arrangements and capacity building requirements:
The MOHP will direct all consultants to adhere to guidelines designed to safeguard
and improve physical environments.

(f)

(g)

(ll)

ANNEX XI
Page 2 of 2

VIP construction and safe water and waste management will be largely enhanced by
communities after training.

Public consultations and disclosure requirements:

The MOHP will from time to time offer public forums to publicise the programme
activities.

This will include especially a presentation of the proposal for the rehabilitated facilities
to ensure community support.

Estimated costs: Programme environmental components:

The major environmental improvement falls under the facilities development
programme for rehabilitation of health facilities, safe water supply and safe waste
management. Notably, medical waste management will be improved through the
construction of medical waste and placenta pits as part of the hospital rehabilitation.

Implementation schedule and reporting:

Any items pertinent to environmental and social management planning adhere to the
overall implementation schedule provided in Annex X.
