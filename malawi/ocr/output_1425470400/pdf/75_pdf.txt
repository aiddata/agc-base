SUMMARY

Malawi has been under successive structural adjustment programmes since 1981. The EC’s Structural
Adjustment support (SAF I to SAP IV) covered the period from 1993 to 2004 with the overall objective
of supporting the reform programmes and, mitigating the impact of the existing adjustment
programmes’ ﬁscal austerity.

The last budget support operation — PRBSI — was prepared in 2005 to cover FY 05/06. The Financing
Agreement was signed in Sept 2005 and release of funds are in line with programme schedule: €14.7M
were released in October 2005 and €15. 1M were released in June 2006.

The new PRBS 2 (€34 M) provides a continuity for the PRBSl and supports the implementation of the
Government of Malawi (GoM) development programme (MGDS) and its reform programmes, with a
particular emphasize on Government effort in improving public ﬁnance management (PFM) and social
sectors financing. Technical Assistance (64M) is earmarked for the provision of Technical Assistance

5W to the,.GoM~Monitoring-&-Evaiuation—Programme and further Technical

assistance to social sectors in the revision of reliable and regular indicators.
Mgr

The timetable of implementation of the PRBS 2 covers FY06/07 and FY 07/08. The programme will
start toward the end of 2006 and will ﬁnish at the latest in December 2010 (for the TA component).
The various Budget Support tranches will be released in quarter 2 and quarter 4 of each ﬁscal year,
with arrangement presented in the DTA section 2.1: ﬁrst tranche of €8M (ﬁxed tranche) by the end of
2006, second tranche in quarter 4 of FY 06/07 of circa €5M (performance+variable components), third
tranche of 68M (ﬁxed tranche) in quarter 2 of F Y07/08, fourth tranche of circa 69M (performance and
variable components) in quarter 4 of FY 07/08. In addition, a total of €4M has been set aside to provide

Technical assistance in areas of public ﬁnanc anagement, monitoring-and-evaluatiom social sector
technical assistance, studies, audit and evaluation.

 

All tranches are linked to the satisfactory implementation of the GoM/IMF PRGF and positive six
monthly CABS reviews. Tranche 1 is linked to the approval of the MGDS by GoM, the approval of a
new PF M Action Plan by the Ministry of Finance and the reception of Technical Assistance request in
social sector areas of interest to the PAF. Other tranches will be linked to the availability of PFM and
Social Sector indicators and progress on the implementation of the PFM Action Plan by GoM. Details

of tranches requirement and the assessment process is presented in section 2.3 and in Annex 1 to the
DTA. -

1. INTERVENTION
1.1. Programme description
1.1.1. Expected results of the Government policy

The primary objective of macro-economic policy is to create a stable environment that is conducive to
private sector growth. This entails a sustained real growth rate between 5% and 6% per annum until
2008 and a reduction of inflation to single ﬁgures (7% in 2008). A continuing reduction of the ﬁscal
deﬁcit is anticipated from curtailing non-priority expenditures and from sustainable increases in
revenues, although the scope for raising the revenue/GDP ratio is limited by the already highly taxed
formal sector. Nominal interest rate needs to be reduced drastically to levels that would allow private
sector to borrow from local banking system and invest in productive factors. Foreign exchange rates
need to continue to be market determined to maintain external competitiveness, and international
reserves will be maintained at levels equivalent to 3 months of projected imports of goods and services.

1.1.2. Speciﬁc EC contribution to the economic reform programme

The EC contribution of €34 will be provided in the form of direct budgetary support mainly to reduce
the budget deﬁcit after grants for FY 2006/07 and FY 2007/08. The programme will contribute to the
country’s'foreign exchange requirements for the import of goods and services, foreign debt servicing

3

requirements and the maintenance/build up of international reserves. This programme will be followed
by 3 year BS programme (PRBS 3 for FY 2008/2009, FY 2009/2010 and FY 2010/2011). PRBS2is
aligned with the GoM Malawi Growth and Development Strategy which will start in July2006, With
the new WB support programme which is expected to start toward the end of 2006 and With the IMF
PRGF Programme which is expected to run up until the end of the PRBSZ programme in June 2008
(for Budget Support component only)

The impact of the programme on the ﬁscal framework will be limited as PRBS 2 represents a mere 2%
of GoM expected expenditure for the two ﬁscal years covered. However, by providing assistance the
EC, together with all CABS donors, will go a long way to support GoM endeavour to implement its
PRGF within the agreed ﬁscal framework, thus leading to an increasing amount of public funds to be
directed to pro poor and pro growth expenditures by reducing the burden of domestic debt on GoM
budget.

The programme will also allow for the EC to maintain its role in CABS and as such will deepen
political dialogue with GoM, through CABS reviews and other bilateral arrangements. Finally the
programme will greatly facilitate the alignment and harmonization of donors, along the lines of the
Paris Declaration.

It has been demonstrated through several Public Finance Management (PFM) studies and assessments
that PFM is an area that needs to be strengthened. The experience of PRBS 1 variable tranche has also
shown that assistance in the preparation of reliable indicators was needed,in addition to supportin he

millions to strengthen Government Public Finance Management, to support GoM M&E Road Map
while providing for additional funds to tailor the assistance required on a certain number of key
indicators. PFM and M&E issues were already supported under the PRBS 1 programme and PRBS 2
will ensure that achievements are consolidated and further enhanced up until 2010.

Precise support to Public Finance Management will be agreed upon in the coming months, in line with
the priorities which will be highlighted in the new PFM Action Plan expected toward the end of 2006
(the new PFM Action Plan is a condition for disbursement of the ﬁrst tranche of the BS programme).
The same approach is followed by all CABS members.

The amounts indicated in the table above are indicative. Modalities for the management of the funds
earmarked are deﬁned in Article 2.1 and 2.2 of this document.

1.2. Origin and preparation of the support programme
1.2.1. Eligibility to the EC '5 structural adjustment support

The Commission considers. that on the basis of the positive implementation of the IMF PRGF
programme (approved in July 2005), direct budgetary support for the amount of €34M (including 64M
for Technical Assistance component) could be granted according to the provisions of article 67 of the
Cotonou Partnership Agreement. The release of the funds will be conditional to the continuous
satisfactory implementation of the GoM/[MF PRGF programme for FY06/07 and FY 07/08.

1.2.2. Lessons learned from past experience

The PRBS l programme approved in July 2005, covering FY 2005/06, included a variable tranche
(€12M or 28% of the total) related to achievements on 10 social indicators and 6 PFM indicators from
the GoM/CABS Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). The experience of the ﬁrst PAF review in
March 2006, where GoM fully or partially achieved 75%I of the PAF targets, has been integrated to the
PRBS 2 through the following aspects:

0 The PFM indicators in the second variable tranche will be extracted from the new GoM PFM
Action Plan, expected to be aligned to the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) Assessment Framework. Two missions conducted in 2005 and 2006 have identiﬁed
critical PFM areas to be reformed. By pursuing a self developed PEFA based PFM reform
agenda, the GoM will also achieved PAF targets. Technical Assistance provision is made
available in the Programme to assist GoM in implementing its PFM reform programme.

0 Social Sector indicators have been selected in line with GoM policies and programmes (in
Health and Education in particular) as presented in the MGDS. Deﬁnitions, baseline, target,
source and availability of indicators have been prepared through sector review processes and
are fully coherent with sector priorities.- '

0 The focus has been put on MDGs and all indicators selected are monitored by the GoM on an
annual basis through the M&E Road Map. In addition attempt has been made to select
indicators for which interpretation is straightforward and widely accepted.

0 The generally weak state of data collection, compiling and interpretation by GoM institutions
has been considered and technical assistance provision is made available through the PRBS 2
to assist GoM in providing regular and reliable data on an annual basis.

Finally, the variable tranche under PRBS 1 has helped deepening the dialogue between donors and
GoM as well as the dialogue within the GoM on social sector and PFM achievements. The fact that
GoM failed on some targets under the PRBS 1 has mobilised the Ministry of Finance which ideally is
expected to be more active in the regular monitoring of social sector achievements. This in turn should
have a positive impact on the variable tranche payment under PRBS 2.

1.2.3. Dialogue with government and donors and preparatory actions

The European Commission has joined in 2001 the Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS)
group, which constitutes a formal forum of discussion and exchange for development partners involved
in budget support among them and with GoM. The CABS currently consists of 4 full members (DFID,
Norway, Swedish SIDA and EC) and ﬁve observers (Germany, World Bank, IMF, UNDP and the
African Development Bank). Both Germany and the World Bank are expected to formally join the

 

' In the case of EC PRBSl indicators, extracted from the PAF, the GoM fully or partially achieved 60% of these,
thus leading to the payment of 55% of the variable tranche.

 

Group as full members within the next 12 to 24 months. The group holds its reviews every six months,
in February and September, focusing on PF M issues, Budget preparation and implementation and GoM
performance along the line of the Performance Assessment Framework with emphasis on social
sectors. The last two CABS reviews acknowledged the govemment’s commitments to ﬁscal discipline
throughout FY 04/05 and the ﬁrst half of FY2005/06 and have allowed a frank and open dialogue to be
established with GoM on a number of important issues such as Public Finance Management,
functioning of oversight institutions, service delivery and social sector performance.

A Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a set of 22 indicators to monitor progresses in social
sectors and in PFM, as well as a Joint Partnership Framework (JF) have been agreed upon with the
GoM in September 2005. The documents will guide the implementation of Budget Support in Malawi
in the ﬁxture and, as such, the support provided under PRBS 2 will be both compliant with the JF and
PAF requirements and in line with development partners’ good practices and harmonization principles.

Finally, CABS donors have demonstrated their commitment to the Paris Declaration and the
harmonization of assistance by conducting a GoM/Donors Joint Programme Review in March 2006.
The review covered 6 key sectors (Rural Development & Food Security, Infrastructure, Health,

Education, Private Sector Development and Governance) and included all core CABS donors, the
World Bank and GT2.

The PRBS 2 will ensure continuity with the PRBS 1 both in terms of macroeconomic and social sector
objectives as well as technical support provided. In addition the programme ﬁts into the overall support
provided by CABS donors in Malawi, the IMF and the WB.

Within CABS, DFlD has resumed Budget Support late in 2004 and is now committed to support FY
06/07 through its Poverty Reduction Budget Support programme of £20M. Support for FY 07/08,
although agreed in principle, will depend on the DFID ﬁnancial envelope allocated to Malawi, the
overall macroeconomic stability and the capacity of GoM to prioritise according to the MGDS. Norway

is expected to contribute €15M during the period and Sweden is committed to disburse roughly similar
amounts.

Following three years of suspension of programme with IMF, the new administration agreed with IMF
in June 2004 to a Staff Monitored Programme to be implemented for 12 months, in order to build a new
track record of good performance and to restore Government credibility. The SMP was successfully
implemented until June 2005 and led to a new PRGF programme. The three-year PRGF arrangement,
approved in August 2005, provides US$55 million to support the implementation of Malawi’s
economic reform programme. The reviews of the programme after 3, 6 and 9 months (up to March
2006) concluded that the programme was on track.

With regards to WB, the FIMAG programme (balance of payment support) came to end in April 2006
with a payment of US$25M. The WB is preparing a follow up programme to cover FY 06/07 and FY
07/08, in line with IMF PRGF and PRBS 2 schedule, with an estimated US$10M to 20M for the two
years. This will top up the expected reduction of US$20M per year in statutory expenditure due by
GoM to the WB as the result of the HIPC initiative. The programme is expected to be developed along
the lines deﬁned by the CABS Joint Framework in order to ascertain alignment and complementarities
of the initiative.

Malawi has qualiﬁed for HlPC relief in 2000. Since the HTPC Assessment in 2004 substantial progress
have been achieved and, should the PRGF be conﬁrmed on track as of June 2006, Completion Point is
likely to be reached the same month thus allowing Malawi to fully beneﬁt from the multilateral debt
relief initiative. This would signiﬁcantly enhance GoM ability to address a number of challenges
(retiring of the domestic debt, implementation of the pay reform policy, improving on service
delivery...) over a relatively short period of time.

 

For the period considered by the PRBS 2 (l5| of July 2006 to 30‘h of June 2008, covering FY 2006/2007
and FY 2007/2008), CABS members are expected to disburse an estimated amount of €123 millions
(with DFID representing about 36%, EC 24%, IMF 20% and Norway and Sweden together the
remaining 20%). EC will then be the second largest Budget Support donor in Malawi.

1.2.4 Public Finance

In line with Cotonou Agreement requirements, while weak in general terms, Malawi public expenditure
management is improving and becoming more transparent, accountable and effective, with public
procurement system gradually implemented and a macroeconomic/sectoral policies well deﬁned. A
number of initiatives (e.g. implementation of IFMIS, centralization of payments, preparation of the
updated PFM action plan), the satisfactory implementation of the IMF SMP and PRGF since July 2004
reﬂected progress made in public expenditure management by the new administration.

The satisfactory implementation of the IMF PRGF since July 2005 (and the IMF SMP from July 2004
to June 2005) translates progresses made in public expenditure management by the new administration.
The May 2006 PEFA review of PFM in Malawi conﬁrmed the assessment made both by the IMF and
CABS donors throughout the period and indicated that good progress had been made on more than
60% of the PFM indicators considered.

The Malawi Economic Growth Strategy has been prepared in 2005 and will be approved by Cabinet in
June 2006. The Strategy will form the basis of macroeconomic and sectoral policies in the future.

2. IMPLEMENTATION

2.1. Implementation means

The support delivered for this operation will be divided between direct untargeted budget support (€30)
and institutional support (64 million). The aim of the budget support is to contribute to the satisfactory
implementation of GoM programme toward poverty reduction (in particular in maintaining social
sectors spending), to reinforce the macro-economic stability and the management of Public Finances.
GoM performance will be assessed continuously through the CABS reviews (in September 2006,
February 2007 and September 2007 and February 2008) with decision to go ahead with the release of
the tranches and the implement the various programme modalities taken throughout the period. In
addition, the Performance Assessment Framework agreed upon between the GoM and the CABS
Group, and revised on an annual basis, will form the basis of the PRBSZ performance indicators
assessment. Section 2.3 provides details for each and every instalment foreseen under the PRBS
programme.

In line with Cotonou article 61.2, the programme is conditional upon satisfactory macroeconomic
management, as evidenced by the continued implementation of a macro-economic programme
supervised by the IMF, and upon positive developments in Public Finance Management.

Finally, PRBS 2 support will be released in four instalments as follows (Speciﬁc requirements
for tranche releases are presented in section 2.3 below):

should be transferred. Upon reception of the transfers, Reserve Bank of Malawi will immediately
transfer the counter value in Malawi Kwacha to the Govemment’s consolidated account. The exchange
rate will be the middle rate of the inter-bank foreign currency market on the value date of the
instruction.

The Technical Assistance component will be implemented in accordance with the applicable 9‘11 EDF
rules. The Contracting Authority for this component can be the NAG or the Commission (Delegation)

The operational implementation period of the FA runs up to 31/12/2010. The period of execution of the
FA, including a 24 months period of closure, will be up to 31/12/2012. All amounts uncommitted
available under the FA will automatically be cancelled 6 months after the end of the execution period.

 

All contracts related to TA and programme estimates implementing the FA must be contracted out
within 3 years following the approval of the global ﬁnancing conunitrnent. This period can not be
extended. This does not affect audit and evaluation contracts which could be signed at a later date.

The Financing Agreement (FA) must be signed no later than the 315‘ of December of the year following
the year in which the corresponding global ﬁnancing commitment has been adopted. Should this not be
the case, the grant will be cancelled.

All contracts implementing the ﬁnancing agreement must be awarded and implemented in accordance
with the procedures and standard documents laid down and published by the Commission for the
implementation of external operations, in force at the time of the launch of the procedure in question.

2.3. General and specific conditions, compatibility with the BWI programme.

a. Description of performance monitoring arrangements

The Indicators linked to the PRBS 2 Programme originate from the CABS Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) revised in 2006. All social indicators from the PAP are extracted from the MGDS.
Public Finance Management indicators for the second variable tranche instalment will be related to the
key areas of interest identiﬁed in PEFA Assessment conducted in May 2006 and in the new PFM
Action Plan to be prepared by GoM by end of 2006. In line with GoM/CABS Joint Framework
provisions, CABS will be provided with a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the indicators
prior to the February 2007 and February 2008 CABS reviews. The MGDS annual reviews should be
able to produce its report in time for the CABS reviews. If this is not the case, preliminary data from
M&E Road Map reports and sector reviews (health and education) will be used. The alignment of the
PRBS 2 with CABS and to some extent the PRGF reviews will allow informed decisions to be made as
to the release of funds. On the basis of the GoM report on the PAP, the EC will make its own
assessment to determine the ﬁnal amount to be paid as variable tranche.

The PAF is revised ,on an annual basis: revised PAF for 2006 is the source of PRBS 2 variable tranche
for social sector indicators for 2007 review. The revised PAF for 2007 will be the source of PRBS 2
variable tranche indicators for both PFM and Social Sector for 2008 review. In principle all social
sectors indicators will remain similar in nature to the indicators listed for 2006. Only education
indicators will be added and targets for all indicators will be reﬁned for the assessment due in February
2008. Public ﬁnance management indicators will be selected in February 2007, on the basis of the new
Action Plan expected at the end of 2006. The ﬁnal selection of indicators and targets for PFM and
social sectors for the 2008 variable tranches will be the subject of an exchange of letters between the
GoM and the European Commission. Variable tranche indicators will be precisely deﬁned for February
2008 review.

GoM performance will be assessed continuously through the CABS reviews (in September 2006,
February 2007 and September 2007 and February 2008) with decision to go ahead with releasing the
PRBS II disbursements and implement the various programme modalities taken throughout the period.

In line with Cotonou Article 64, the programme is conditional upon satisfactory macroeconomic
management, as evidenced by the continued implementation of a macro-economic programme
supervised by the IMF. Where the IMF programme is delayed or temporarily suspended but the macro-
economic situation is judged to be satisfactory overall by the IMF, the decision to disburse will be
taken by the EC, in consultation with the IMF mission.

b. General conditions for disbursement of all tranches

The general conditions for disbursement of all tranches are as follOws:

l. Satisfactory macroeconomic management, as evidenced by the continued implementation of a
macro-economic programme supervised by the IMF. Where the IMF programme is delayed or

temporarily suspended but the macro-economic situation is judged to be satisfactory overall by the
IMF, the decision to disburse will be taken by the EC, in consultation with the IMF mission;.

2. Continued dialogue between CABS and Government of Malawi on macroeconomics, public ﬁnance,
sectoral policies and good governance sanctioned by the implementation of the Partnership Framework
cooperation modalities.

3. Satisfactory progress in PFM reform.

4. Availability of GoM/CABS PAF Assessment to allow for variable tranche calculation (Instalment 2
and 4)

5. Request for disbursement from NAO
The requirements for the release of the various tranches are presented below:

A) 1st Instalment: Fixed Tranche — (€8M — FY 06/07 Q2)

The ﬁrst instalment will be disbursed following a] a positive CABS review in September 2006; b] the
ﬁnalised MGDS approved by Cabinet; c] a new PFM Action Plan being ﬁnalised and approved by the
Ministry of Finance and d] the reception by the EC Delegation of GoM request(s) for Technical

PAF indicators).

B) 2"d Instalment: performance tranche + variable tranche (€2M + Max €3M - FY 06/07 Q4)

The second instalment will be made of a performance tranche and a variable tranche. The performance
tranche (€2M) will be disbursed following a] a positive CABS review in February 2007; b] the data
allowing for the calculation of the amount to be paid as variable tranche are available so that
performance and variable tranches are paid in one instalment. The variable tranche, will be calculated
on the basis of Government performance assessed through selected indicators from the GoM/CABS
PAF during the February 2007 CABS review.

C) 3rd Instalment: Fixed tranche ( €8M - FY 07/08 Q2)

The third instalment will be disbursed following a] a positive CABS review in Sept 2007 and b] good
progress in the implementation of the new PFM Action Plan.

D) 4"I Instalment: performance tranche + variable tranche (€2M + Max €7M -— FY 07/08 Q4)

The fourth instalment will be made of a performance tranche and a variable tranche. The performance
tranche (€2M) will be disbursed following a] a positive CABS review in February 2008; b] good
progress in the implementation of the PFM Action Plan and c] the data allowing for the calculation of
the amount to be paid as variable tranche are available so that performance and variable tranches are
paid in one instalment. The variable tranche, will be calculated on the basis of Government

performance assessed through selected indicators from the GoM/CABS PAF during the February 2008
CABS review

c. Areas in which speciﬁc conditions for disbursement of variable tranches will be deﬁned

Instalment 2 (first variable tranche), to be assessed in February 2007 will be based on 4 indicators
related to health sector outcomes extracted from the CABS PAF. To initiate the assessment process the
GoM will provide an analysis of the results achieved with regard to the indicators, and point out any
external factors that inﬂuenced the results. For each indicator a score shall be calculated: 100% for full
achievement, 50% for substantial positive progress (half of the expected progress) but failure to reach
the target. or 0% for minimal or no progress. (achievement below of equal to baseline, or failure to
calculate the result). Each indicator has a weight summing to 100% (equivalent to 63 million for whole

10

variable tranche): 25% for the 4 indicators (equivalent to €0.75M per indicator). The formula for
tranche calculation is presented below.

Instalment 4 (second variable tranche), to be assessed in February 2008 will be based on: (i) 6 social
sector indicators, preferably those used for the ﬁrst variable tranche (plus two related to education) and
for which targets will be revised inline with the PAF revised in 2007, (ii) 4 to 8 PFM indicators along
the PAP revised in 2007. CABS will endeavour to select PFM indicators from the GoM new PFM
Action Plan expected by the end of 2006. To initiate the assessment process the GOM will provide an
analysis of the results achieved with regard to the indicators, and point out any external factors that
inﬂuenced the results. For each indicator a score shall be calculated: 100% for full achievement, 50%
for substantial positive progress but failure to reach the target, or 0% for minimal or no progress
(achievement below of equal to baseline, or failure to calculate the result). Each indicator has a weight
summing to 100% (equivalent to 63 million for the social sector variable tranche and (-34 million for the
PFM variable tranche). The maximum total amount for the variable part will be 67 million (E3 million
+ 64 million). Formula for tranche calculation is presented below.

For both variable tranche instalments, the calculated results will be discussed at a meeting between
responsible line Ministries, MoF, and the European Commission, preferably in the context of the
CABS February reviews in 2007 and 2008, or shortly afterward. On the basis of the GoM report on the

PAP and discussions, the EC will make its own assessment to determine the ﬁnal amount to be paid as
variable tranche. '

With regards to instalment n°2, once the Variable Tranche is calculated, the instalment (performance
tranche of 62 millions + variable of maximum €3 millions) will be released in one ﬁnancial transfer to
the RBM account, for further credit to GoM account nol.

With regards to instalment n°4, once the Variable Tranche is calculated, the instalment (performance of
€2 millions + variable of maximum 67 millions) will be released in one ﬁnancial transfer to the RBM
account, for further credit to GoM account no].

The table of indicators for 2006, to be assessed in February 2007, is presented in section 5. The list of
indicators as well as the deﬁnitions, baseline, target for 2006 to be assessed in February 2007 are set
and can not be modiﬁed after the signature of the Financing Agreement.

The table of indicators for 2007, to be assessed in February 2008, will be agreed upon by GoM and the
EC Delegation within two months after the end of February 2007 CABS Review, on the basis of the
revised PAF that will have been agreed upon between GoM and Development Partners. In principle all
social sectors indicators will remain similar in nature to the indicators listed for 2006. Only education
indicators will be added and targets for all indicators will be reﬁned for the assessment due in February
2008. TentatiVe targets for year 2007 are presented in the table in section 5: these will be revised early
in 2007. In addition, 4 to 8 public ﬁnance management indicators will be selected from the PAF, on the
basis of the new action plan on public ﬁnance management to be approved by Ministry of Finance
toward the end of 2006. Revised targets for each social sector indicators and targets for the selected
PFM indicators for 2007 will be used for the assessment to be conducted in February 2008. The ﬁnal
selection of indicators and targets for PFM and social sectors for the 2008 variable tranche will be the
subject of an exchange of letters between the 60M and the European Commission.

3. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Evaluation and Audit arrangement will be conducted as per EC guidelines. A provision for evaluation
and audit is foreseen in the budget of this Financing Agreement. Audit and evaluation contracts, as well
as Framework Contract are always concluded by the Commission, acting for and on the behalf of the
ACP states.

5. MEASURES ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY

Pace of reforms and long-term development objectives

The Malawi Development & Growth Strategy, which has succeeded the MPRS, lays out the objectives,

policies and activities for reducing poverty in the country and generally conforms to the Vision 2020

and the international development targets. The MGDS is expected to start as from July 2006. The
followmg key priorities were identiﬁed as necessary for the implementation of the MGDS:

0 Create stable macroeconomic conditions for growth to instil domestic and international
conﬁdence in the economy and governance.
0 Develop and strengthen business enterprises that contribute positively to economic growth
through deep-rooted private sector reforms, focusing on improvements in infrastructure.
0 Ensure food security to make Malawi a hunger free nation by moving from emergency
responses toacute crises to a system than can addressed chronic food problems.

action which will be implemented over the next 2 or 3 ﬁscal years. Implementation of the various
activities foreseen in the new Action Plan will be monitored regularly and will inform decision making
process of the CABS and BC with regards to the release of the instalment 3 and 4.

With regards to the monitoring and evaluation, the GoM has demonstrated its commitment to
implement the road map that was agreed with donor in 2004. Efforts have been made to establish a
serious M&E network throughout the country and studies/survey (such as the Demographic and Health
Survey, the Integrated Household Survey) have been conducted up until mid 2005. The results of these
surveys, together with the data collected by GoM, have informed a Poverty and Vulnerability
Assessment exercise jointly conducted by the GoM and the World Bank and ﬁnalised in May 2006. In
addition, the COM has entered into an agreement with UNDP to assist with the implementation of the
COM M&E Road Map for the next years. The EC through its budget support programmes (PRBSl and
PRBSZ) will be able to contribute to the trust fund set up to support this initiative. Developing a strong
GoM M&E system is at the heart of the result oriented budget support approach supported
development partners.

Cross-cutting issues: environment and gender

Malawi has recognised that poverty is both cause and effect of environmental degradation. The current
programme, through supporting the budget and poverty reduction policies, will have positive effects on
the environment as poverty oﬁen negatively affects the environment.

Some of the assessment indicators for the country performance, extracted from the PAP, are gender-
disaggregated and will reﬂect women health. HIV/AIDS covers all areas of public services (education,
health, gender and social community etc.) and has an impact on all sections of the Malawi society. The
PAF includes one indicator related to HIV/AIDS issues in the country and the same indicator will be
used

4. Variable Tranche calculation -— Instalments 2 and 4.

Instalment 2 (ﬁrst variable tranche), to be assessed in February 2007 will be based on 4 indicators
related to health sector outcomes extracted from the CABS PAF. To initiate the assessment process the
GoM will provide an analysis of the results achieved with regard to the indicators, and point out any
external factors that inﬂuenced the results. For each indicator a score shall be calculated: 100% for full
achievement, 50% for substantial positive progress (half of the expected progress) but failure to reach
the target, or 0% for minimal or no progress (achievement below of equal to baseline, or failure to
calculate the result). Each indicator has a weight summing to 100% (equivalent to 63 million for whole
variable tranche): 25% for the 4 indicators (equivalent to €0.75M per indicator). The formula for
tranche calculation is presented below.

Instalment 4 (second variable tranche), to be assessed in February 2008 will be based on: (i) 6 social
sector indicators, preferably those used for the first variable tranche (plus two related to education) and
for which targets will be revised inline with the PAF revised in 2007, (ii) 4 to 8 PFM indicators along
the PAF revised in 2007. CABS will endeavour to select PFM indicators from the COM new PFM
Action Plan expected by the end of 2006. To initiate the assessment process the GoM will provide an

(achievement below of equal to baseline, or failure to calculate the result). Each indicator has a weight
summing to 100% (equivalent to €3 million for the social sector variable tranche and 64 million for the
PFM variable tranche). The maximum total amount for the variable part will be 67 million (63 million
+ €4 million). Formula for tranche calculation is presented below.

For both variable tranche instalments, the calculated results will be discussed at a meeting between
responsible line Ministries, MoF, and the European Commission, preferably in the context of the
CABS February reviews in 2007 and 2008, or shortly afterward. On the basis of the GoM report on the
PAF and discussions, the EC will make its own assessment to determine the ﬁnal amount to be paid as
variable tranche.

16

With regards to instalment n°2, once the Variable Tranche is calculated, the instalment (performance
tranche of 62 millions + variable of maximum 63 millions) will be released in one ﬁnancial transfer to
the RBM account, for further credit to GoM account nol.

With regards to instalment n°4, once the Variable Tranche is calculated, the instalment (performancc of
62 millions + variable of maximum 67 millions) will be released in one ﬁnancial transfer to the RBM
account, for further credit to GoM account ml.

The table of indicators for 2006, to be assessed in February 2007, is presented in section 5. The list of
indicators as well as the deﬁnitions, baseline, target for 2006 to be assessed in February 2007 are set
and can not be modiﬁed after the signature of the Financing Agreement.

The table of indicators for 2007, to be assessed in February 2008, will be agreed upon by 60M and the
EC Delegation within two months after the end of February 2007 CABS Review, on the basis of the
revised PAF that will have been agreed upon between GoM and Development Partners. In principle all
social sectors indicators will remain similar in nature to the indicators listed for 2006. Only education
indicators will be added and targets for all indicators will be reﬁned for the assessment due in February
2008. Tentative targets for year 2007 are presented in the table in section 5: these will be revised early
in 2007. In addition, 4 to 8 public ﬁnance management indicators will be selected from the PAF, on the
basis of the new action plan on public ﬁnance management to be approved by Ministry of Finance
toward the end of 2006. Revised targets for each social sector indicators and targets for the selected
PFM indicators for 2007 will be used for the assessment to be conducted in February 2008. The ﬁnal
selection of indicators and targets for PFM and social sectors for the 2008 variable tranche will be the
subject of an exchange of letters between the 60M and the European Commission.

If the indicator provided by GoM by February 2007 for the year 2006 is: 40% or above, the score for
the indicator will be 100% as target has been reached. As a result, 100% of weight will be released
(100% x 6750.000 =) €750.000.

If the indicator provided by GoM by February 2007 for the year 2006 is: Below 40% but substantially
above the Baseline (38%) the score for the indicator will be 50% as substantial positive progress have
been observed. As a result, 50% of weight will be released (50% x 6750.000 =) 6375.000

If the indicator provided by GoM by February 2007 for the year 2006 is: below or equal to the
baseline (38%), the score for the indicator will be 0% as no progress was recorded. As a result, 0% of
weight will be released (0% x 6750.000 =) 60

If data for the indicator in year 2006 are not provided by the GoM by February 2007, the score for
the indicator will automatically be 0%. As a result, 0% of weight will be released (0% x 6750.000 =)
60

If an indicator can be shown to have been signiﬁcantly affected by an unforeseeable exogenous shock,
it may (on justiﬁed request by the Government and subject to agreement by the Commission) be
dropped and its weight distributed among the remaining indicators.

The same assessment will take place for all the indicators and the total variable tranche will be the
arithmetic sum of the results obtained for each and every indicators assessed. The same methodology

17

will apply for the results for year 2007, for social sector and PFM indicators, on the basis of the data
presented by GoM in Feb 2008.
