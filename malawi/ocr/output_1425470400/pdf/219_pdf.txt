1. INTERVENTION

1.1 Objectives

General obg'ecn‘ve:

The overall objective of the PRBS III programme is to support poverty reduction through the
implementation of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS).

Specich obz'ective:

The specific objective of the PRBS lll programme is to support macroeconomic stability
whilst enhancing the focus of public expenditure on poverty reduction programmes.

1.2 Expected results and main activities

The programme is intended to contribute to the consolidation of the macro—economic
framework with a focus on protecting the results achieved in the last few years from the
recent external shocks, mainly skyrocketing oil import prices and increase of fertiliser prices.
This is to allow the harmonious implementation of the MGDS whose main thrust is to create
wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means of
achieving poverty reduction and implementing social sector reforms aimed at improving the
social sector indicators. An important focus in Malawi’s strategy is reform in the area of
public finance management which are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of public
expenditure, through a better alignment of sectoral priorities and expenditure to the MGDS
strategy, and at enhancing the efﬁciency of expenditure, through the purchase of higher value
for money and the control of wastage.

The main activities will be contributing to the policy dialogue around the implementation of
the MGDS, and the CABS semi—annual consultations on implementation of the PAF. These
activities are expected to provide encouragement and incentives to the government to
vigorously implement its programmes of reform as part of a sustained policy dialogue.
Complementary support will be provided through the institutional support of PRBS III.

The EC institutional support component, as part of the PRBS III operation, is geared towards
increasing the capacity of the GOM to (i) implement the new Action Plan for PFM which is
expected to be approved by the Minister of Finance before the end of the year; and to (ii)
facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the MGDS. In keeping with the commitments of
the Paris Declaration neither of the two activities will be implemented in isolation. On the
contrary the EC is going to participate to multi-donor efforts aimed at responding to GoM’s
designed programs.

2. IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Budget and timetable

The EC contribution of €90M will be provided in the form of direct budget support (€ 87M)
for FY 2008/2009, FY 2009/2010 and FY 2010/2011 as well as of institutional assistance (€
3M). In FY 2008/09, EC budget support under this programme is equivalent to about 5.2% of
total annual domestic revenue. This is also equivalent to 1% of GDP in FY 2008/09 and
17.7% of gross ofﬁcial reserves as at the end of 2007 (December 2007). The tentative

schedule of disbursement of the instalments and the institutional assistance is presented here

Performance Indicators and the National Policies and Strategies

Introduction

The selection of these indicators are based on fulﬁlling the purpose of general budget support and
objectively provides an incentive for GoM to implement its own policies and achieve targets.

Additionally, these performance indicators provide annual targets on a pro-rata basis towards medium
term MGDS and MDG targets.

Public Finance Management Performance Indicators
The PFM indicators include all the six PFM indicators which are deﬁned in the PAF.

PAF indicators 2, 3 and 5

The ﬁrst indicator is on credibility of the budget expenditure outturn compared to original approved
budget (PAF indicator 2). This indicator is aligned to PEFA indicator 2 and ensures that government
expenditures to most peripheral structures of government are maintained as approved in the budget. In
so doing, Government ensures that policies and strategies included in the MGDS ﬁnanced are

implemented as planned so that public services are provided in line with the national budget approved
by Parliament.

PAF indicators 6 and 7

00M has developed Public Finance Management and Public Audit Acts in which expenditure
reporting and external audit timeliness are legislated (PAF indicators 6 and 7). According to the Public
Finance Management Act, GOM is supposed to submit annual appropriation accounts to the National
Audit Ofﬁce (NAO) within four months of every ﬁscal year end. This is a statutory obligation which

PAF indicators 9

The sixth indicator is on public procurement improved capacity (PAF indicator 9). (30M in 2003
passed a new procurement code that addresses a number ofmodern public procurement management

government departments. Special and internal procurement units have been established and functional.
In order to check whether the procurement systems are improving, a procurement audit is anticipated
by December 2008. This will provide further evidence on the value for money being achieved by GoM
expenditure when purchasing goods and services. Additionally, improved use of public procurement
will consolidate the achievement of the Paris declaration of using national procurement systems in
government.

Social Sectors Performance Indicators
a) Education:
PAF indicators 14 and 15

According to the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS 2006/11) the emphasis in
primary education is on equipping pupils with basic knowledge and skills to enable them function as

competent and productive citizens. However, the adoption ofa free primary policy in 1994 resulted in

are being deployed to rural areas. Unless this is done it will be difﬁcult to improve quality of
education that is necessary for sustained national development. Hence pupil per qualiﬁed teacher ratio
in rural areas is an appropriate indicator considering that the ratio is currently at 95:0 which is much
too high considering the required pupil-teacher ratio of 60:1. This is also in line with the MGDS and
the National Education Sector Plan (NESP).

Survival rates for boys and girls in standard 5 are currently at 53.6% and 50.7%, respectively. This is
largely driven by a number of factors that include poor quality of teaching as a result of the
insufﬁcient number of teachers and learning materials, large class sizes, and poor school
infrastructure. As a result boys and girls drop out of school before they reach standard 5. Already
GoM has plans to introduce an automatic promotion policy in primary schools in order to reduce
repetition as well as drop out rates. The implementation of this policy will have to be monitored in
order to assess its impact on retention. As such the survival rate in standard 5 is an appropriate
indicator for this purpose. As regards the survival rate for girls in standard 8, the rate was at 26.1% in
2007 while that for boys is at 35% yet the ratio of boys to girls is 0.95. Clearly girls face social and
cultural challenges in Malawian schools particularly in rural areas hence are more likely to drop out as
they grow older and mature. Again this calls for action on the part of GoM in order to achieve gender
balance and empowerment of women. This indicator is in line with the MGDS and the NESP.

b) Health
PAF indicators 16, 17, 18 and 19:

Again the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS 2006/11) recognises that child
immunization, maternal mortality, human resources for health and HIV/AIDS are major issues that
should be addressed in Malawi. As such these are prioritised in the health SWAP. Therefore, the
health SWAP objectively aims at improving quality, equity and access to health services through EHP
by addressing the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Accordingly the performance indicators in
health monitor the maternal mortality among pregnant women, the immunisation of one-year-old
children, training and retention of health workers and HIV/AIDS prevention. in terms of
immunisation, measles vaccinations at national and district levels are expected to improve in order to
contribute towards the reduction of child mortality. By increasing the proportion of birth attended by
skilled health personnel and increasing nurse population ratio, the GoM is addressing the issue of high
maternal mortality rate in Malawi which currently stands at an alarming rate of 984 deaths per 100,000
births and is among the highest in the World. The indicator on HIV/AIDS is particularly preventing
the transmission of HIV From mothers to their babies. In turn this reduces child mortality which as
mentioned already is an MDG indicator. Thus, the choice of health indicators is in line with MGDS
objective but also MDG targets.

The disbursement conditions for the variable tranche are set for the first year and may be
amended in accordance with Article 10 of the Special Conditions of the Financing
Agreement.

5. Performance evaluation arrangements for variable tranches

Each performance indicator has been given a weight of € 1.25 million and each indicator will
be evaluated and analysed by the EC following the provisions of the relevant information by
the Government of Malawi and consideration in the context of the CABS review.

If the data provided by GoM and assessed by the EC show that the agreed target has been met
or exceeded for a given indicator, the target has been achieved. As a result, 100% of the
amount will be released (100% x € 1.25 million) = € 1.25 million.

If the data provided by GoM and assessed by the EC show that for a given indicator the
agreed target has not been met, but that substantial progress has been made beyond the
baseline, the score for the indicator will be 50%. As a result, 50% of the amount will be
released (50% x € 1.25 million) = (=3 625,000. Substantial progress is deﬁned as 50% and
above between the baseline and the target.

If the data provided by GoM and assessed by the EC shows little or no progress has been
made against the baseline for a git/en target. As a result, 0% of the amount will be released
(0% x E 1.25 million) = € 0.

1f the indicator has not been provided by GoM for the EC review the score for the indicator
will automatically be 0%. As a result, 0% of the amount will be released (0% x € 1.25
million) = € 0.

if an indicator can be shown to have been signiﬁcantly affected by unforeseeable exogenous
shocks, it may (on justiﬁed request by the Minister of Finance to the EDF National
Authorising Ofﬁcer) be dropped and its weight distributed amongst the remaining indicators.

The same assessment will take place for all the indicators and the total variable tranche will
be the arithmetic sum of the results obtained for each and every indicator assessed.
