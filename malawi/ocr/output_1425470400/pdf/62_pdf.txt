SUMMARY

Malawi has been under successive structural adjustment programmes since 1981. The EC”s
Structural Adjustment support started in 1993 with the overall objective of supporting the
reform programmes and, mitigating the impact of the existing adjustment programmes’ ﬁscal
austerity. Counterpart funds from all four programmes (SAF I to SAP IV) have supported the
government’s recurrent account expenditures in health, education. debt repayments and road
maintenance. In addition, a portion of Cross Border Initiative (CB1) counterpart funds has

i been directed to assist the private sector.

The last budget support operation — SAF IV ~ was prepared in 2000 and covered the period
2001 to 2004. The last two tranches (totalling €15M) were disbursed early 2004 as a follow
up of the completion of the ﬁrst IMF PRGF review in October 2003. The SAF TV programme
ended in December 2004 and a new Poverty Reduction Budget Support programme (PRBSl)
was prepared in 2004/2005 to provide funding for FY 2005/2006, on the basis of a new IMF
PRGF to be agreed upon with the IMF as from mid 2005.

The new PRBS 1 (€415 M) supports the implementation of the Government of Malawi
(GoM) development programme (a revised MPRS, integrating the new government priorities
toward poverty reduction and private sector led growth is due by end of 2005) and, its reform
programmes. In addition to providing external resources for the execution of the national
budget and the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, the programme support: the
implementation of the Malawi poverty reduction programme, with a particular emphasize on
Government effort in improving public ﬁnance management. Additional support is provided

through the PRBS toward improving public ﬁnance management (METF II) and public

ﬁnance oversight (support to National Audit Ofﬁce) while contributing to the Monitoring and,
evaluation endeavour of the Government.

The timetable of implementation of the PRBS 1 covers FY2005/2006. The programme will
start in July 2005 and will ﬁnish at the latest in June 2008 (for the TA component). The
various Budget Support tranches will be released in summer 2005 and spring 2006 in line
with arrangement presented in section 2.1: ﬁrst tranche during summer 2005 of circa 66M
(FLEX), second tranche in summer 2005 of €8M (ﬁxed component), third tranche of circa
€4M (FLEX) during spring 2006, fourth tranche of circa €20.5M (ﬁxed and variable
components) in spring 2005 and a ﬁfth tranche (third bis) of €0.8M ( FLEX) in October 2006.
In addition, a total of 63M has been set aside to provide Technical assistance in areas of
public ﬁnance management, monitoring and evaluation, audit and evaluation.

All tranches are linked to the implementation of the GOM budget in line with. GoM/IMF
PRGF expected to be approved in July 2005. Tranche l, 3 and 3bis are linked to the FLEX
facility and the provision of trade statistics for 2003 and 2004. Tranche 2 is a ﬁxed tranche
related to the completion of 5 overarching conditions (see section 2.3 below) and the
signature of the FA. Tranche 4 is made of a ﬁxed and variable tranches: the latest related to
sixteen PFM and social sector indicators. Details of the assessment process is presented in
section 2.3 and in Annex 1. i

1. INTERVENTION
1.1. Programme description
1.1.]. Expected results of the Government policy

The primary objective of macro—economic policy is to create a stable environment that is
conducive to private sector growth. This entails a sustained real growth rate between 5% and
6% per annum until 2008 and a reduction of inﬂation to single ﬁgures (7% in 2008). A,
continuing reduction of the ﬁscal deﬁcit is anticipated from curtailing non~priority
expenditures and from sustainable increases in revenues, although the scope for raising the
revenue/GDP ratio is limited by the already highly taxed formal sector. Nominal interest rate
needs to be reduced drastically to levels that would allow private sector to borrow from local
banking system and invest in productive factors. Foreign exchange rates need to continue to
be market determined to maintain external competitiveness, and international reserves will, be
maintained at levels‘equivalent to 3 months of projected imports of goods and services.

1.1.2. Specific EC contribution to the economic reform programme

The EC contribution of €41 .5 will be provided in the form of direct budgetary support mainly
to reduce the budget deﬁcit after grants for FY 2005/2006. The programme will contribute to
the country’s foreign exchange requirements for the import of goods and services, foreign
debt servicing requirements and the maintenance/build up of international reserves. This
programme will be followed by 3 year BS programme (PRES 2 for FY 2006/2007, FY
2007/2008 and FY 2008/2009) covering the last three years in power of the current
administration. Aligning the EC PRBS programmes with Malawi calendar will ascertain

'Government commitment to the key economic reforms while allowing Government

administration to beneﬁt from achieving the objectives it sets in the PRES programmes.

The funds generated in Malawi Kwacha will contribute to a reduction in the overall budget
deﬁcit after grants and to the government’s programme of expanded social services,
particularly in the health and education sectors where national targets have been set and
action plans drawn up.

It has been demonstrated that budgeting, accounting and auditing represent an area that need
to be strengthened so that public sector ﬁnancial management will become more robust and.
thereby will set the framework in which macroeconomic support may succeed in its
objectives. The PRBS programme allocates 63 millions to strengthen Government Public
Finance Management, through Technical Assistance support to the Government MTEF ll
programme and other technical assistance initiatives, as follows:

commitments will be established between technical implementing partners and the National
Authorising Ofﬁcer, with the approval of the European Commission. Uncommitted amounts
will be returned to the National Indicative Programme, envelop A.

1.2. Origin and preparation of the support programme
1.2.1. Eligibility to the EC ’3 structural adjustment support

The Commission considers that on the basis of the positive current trend in the management
of public expenditures and in the negotiation a macro—economic framework agreed with the
IMF (a new PRGF programme), direct budgetary support for the amount of €41.5M
(including €3M for Technical Assistance component) could be granted according to the
provisions of article 61.2 and 67 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. The release of the
funds will be conditional to the ﬁnalisation and approval of a GoM/IMF PRGF programme

during the summer of 2005.

1.2.2. Lessons learned from past experience

Malawi has been under successive structural adjustment programmes since 1981,. The EC“s
Structural Adjustment support started in 1993 with the overall objective of supporting the
reform programmes and, mitigating the impact of the existing adjustment programmes“ ﬁscal
austerity. Counterpart funds from all four programmes (SAF I to SAP IV) have supported the
government’s recurrent account expenditures in health, education, debt repayments and road
maintenance. In addition, a portion of Cross Border Initiative (CBI) counterpart funds has
been directed to assist the private sector.

However, this input approach failed to address the entire budget, was fragmented, led to
donor dependency and did not impact on key social indicators. In addition, the audit of the
utilisation of SAF funds, conducted in 2001, demonstrated weaknesses in public ﬁnance
management that needed to be addressed. Based on these experiences, and in line with the

 

new Budget Support approach by the EC, the new programme will be based on performance
indicators related to the social sectors and public ﬁnance management.

1.2.3. Dialogue with government and donors and preparatoer actions

There is broad consensus between government and all donors and lending agencies on the
common goal to reduce poverty in Malawi and to move towards achieving the international
development goals. The European Commission is a major grant donor to Malawi, second to
DﬂD only, Dialogue and cooperation with GoM on European Commission programmes are
good. The EC has been actively involved in the MPRS consultation process in, Malawi, which
has coincided with the formulation of the Country Strategy Paper 2002-2007. There is an
established framework for donor coordination within Malawi —— the Aid Coordination.
Committee — and the EC will continue close cooperation with other partners providing
budgetary support to Malawi within the framework of the CABS Group. The CABS is a
forum for discussion and exchange of information for development partners involved in
budget support and balance of payment support, created in 2000. The European Commission
joined in 2002 and, since then, the group consists of four members (DfID, Norway, Swedish
SIDA and European Commission) and three observers (the World Bank, IMF and Germany).
EC provision of budgetary support is consistent with the CABS assistance framework, whose
members’ timetables and approaches are becoming increasingly coherent. The  has been
collaborating closely with EU member states in the preparation of the PRES: overall
background information, macroeconomic and PFM assessment, organisational, structure
(through CABS) as well as monitoring tools are similar in both EC and DFID Budget: Support
proposal.

Furthermore, the EC seeks to coordinate closely with the IMF and the World Bank. Recent
developments such as CABS participation to World Bank Public Expenditure review in 2005,
the appointment of a new IMF country representative, the regular debrieﬁng with IMF
mission reviews since end of 2004 and the World Bank commitment to join CABS Group in.
2005/2006 will favour more coordination and collaboration between bilateral partners and
Breton Woods Institutions.

In line with OCDE DAC recommendations, the European Commission and, other partners in
Budget Support in Malawi recognise that harmonization of direct budget support and its
alignment on national processes is required to avert possible destabilising impacts of these
major inﬂows, to support policy reforms and to maximise the beneﬁts from pro-poor
programmes. The CABS Partnership Framework, which includes the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF), has been proposed to the Government for that very purpose.
As both elements are critical to the success of the PRBS, agreement on both will be reached
prior to the Financing Agreement of the PRBS Programme.

The CABS framework means a joint appraisal by all members, the implementation of the EC
and European Member states Budget Support programmes will thus be closely coordinated.

1.2.4 Public Finance

The Cotonou Agreement indicates that direct budgetary support can be disbursed to
beneﬁciary countries where (i) public expenditure management is sufﬁciently transparent,
accountable and effective, (ii) public procurement is open and transparent and (iii)
macroeconomic/sectoral policies are well deﬁned. Furthermore, within Malawi it is
recognized that the good management of public funds is fundamental to the implementation
of poverty reduction strategies. Only through a good planning process can the appropriate
priorities be set within limited resource envelopes and through the control of funds during
implementation will the necessary services be delivered and measurable results obtained.

The satisfactory implementation of the IMF SMP since July 2004 translates progresses made
in public expenditure management by the new administration. The expected agreement on a,
new PRGF in 2005 will conﬁrm that GoM commitment to ﬁscal discipline and retirement of
the domestic debt are solid. The Procurement Act (May 2003) and the set up of the Ofﬁce of
the Director of Public Procurement that followed in 2004 are elements toward a more open
and transparent system being set up. The Malawi Economic Growth Strategy, the National
Economic Empowerment Policy and the economic Vision of the new Government will be
consolidated in a Malawi Economic Development Agenda in the coming months and. will
form the basis of macroeconomic and sectoral policies in the future.

2. IMPLEMENTATION

2.1. Implementation means

The support delivered for this operation will be divided between direct untargeted budget
support (63 8.5) and institutional support (€3 million). The aim of the budget support is to
contribute to the satisfactory implementation of GoM programme toward poverty reduction,
to reinforce the macro-economic stability and the'management of Public Finances.

GoM performance will be assessed continuously through the CABS reviews (in, September
2005, February 2006 and September 2006) with decision to go ahead with signing the PRES
Financing Agreement and implement the various programme modalities taken throughout the
period. In addition, the Performance Assessment Framework agreed upon between the (30M,
and the CABS Group will form the basis of the PRES performance indicators assessment

Section 2.3 provides details for each and every instalment foreseen, under the 'PRBS
programme.

The programme is conditional upon evidence that Malawi continues to adhere to the
arrangements of the IMF’S SMP and its successor, in line with Article 64 of the Cotonou

agreement and AIDCO C3 note dated August 2004, reference ‘AIDCO/Cfi/JMR/ﬂi D0004)
28609.

Prior to the signing of the Financing Agreement of the PRBS of €415 millions. conditions
speciﬁed in section 2.3 will have to be met.

PRBS support will be released in ﬁve instalments as follows

A) Three instalments related to FLEX Funds, as follows:

The ﬁrst instalment will be related to FY2002/2003 exports statistics and will be paid in FY
2005/2006 for 100% of the amount due.

The second and third instalment will be related to FY2003/2004 Export Statistics and will be
paid in FY 2005/2006. The second instalment will represent 80% of the amount calculated on
the basis of provisional export statistics, the third instalment will represent the remaining
20% calculated on the basis of the consolidated export statistics.

B) Two instalments related to regular BS.

The ﬁrst instalment will be made of a ﬁxed tranche that will be released upon signature of
the FA.

The second instalment Will be made of a ﬁxed tranche and a variable tranche. While the
ﬁxed tranche is released as long as the IMF programme is on track, the variable tranche, as
detailed in Annex 1, will be calculated on the basis of Government performance assessed
through selected indicators from the GoM/CABS PAF. '

Funds earmarked for technical assistance for the support to MTEF ll activities, the National
Audit Ofﬁce, the MPRS Monitoring & Evaluation process, the PFM studies, evaluation and
audit will be managed through speciﬁc individual commitments opened by the National
Authorising Ofﬁcer and the EC Delegation under the PRBS 1 Programme. These

2.2. Timetable

The timetable of implementation of PRBS 1 covers the 2005 —— 2008 period and three ﬁscal
years or 36 months. The operational phase will start at the signing of the Financing
Agreement and end by June 2008. Budget support related tranches will be released when
conditions are satisﬁed. The implementation period of the Technical Component is foreseen
from lst July 2005 to 30th June 2008. It will be followed by a closure period ending with the
programme. The Financing Agreement will be in force till 30/06/2010. After this date, any
amounts not released will be cancelled, except through speciﬁc waivers granted by the

European Commission.

 

 

2.3. General and, speciﬁc conditions, compatibility with the BW’I
programme

a. Description of performance monitoring arrangements

The Indicators linked to the PRBS Programme originate from the CABS Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF). The PAF will be agreed upon between (30M and Budget
Support donors prior to the signing of the PRBS Financing Agreement. All indicators from
the PAF are extracted essentially from the MPRS. Other GoM approved programmes (IMF
SMP or PRGF, WB FIMAG etc.) may be used particularly with regards to Public Finance
Management indicators. The EC will request to be provided with a quantitative and
qualitative assessment of the indicators prior to the February 2006 CABS reviews. The
MPRS Annual Review (AR) for FY2004/2005 should be able to produce its report by
February 2006. If this is not the case, preliminary data from the AR will be used. In line with
the 2003/04 review, the 04/05 AR is expected provide not only quantitative data for the
indicators but also a qualitative analysis of indicator context and the resulting policy
conclusions. Evaluation of progress on indicators ~social sector and PFM related- will take
place in Sept 2005 and February 2006 CABS reviews. Final opinion on the progress with
PRBS selected indicator will be made during the February 2006 review. The alignment of the
PRBS with CABS and MPRS reviews will allow informed decisions to be made as to the
release of funds as well as the future BS programme (PRBS 2) covering the next three FY.
Finally, these decisions will be timely with regards to GoM budget preparation for FY
2006/07.

Malawi performance indicators measuring on an annual basis the outcome of government:
policies and subsequent activities need to develop. Objectives for most indicators included in
the MPRS are set for 2005. The work that has been conducted in 2003 to monitor
implementation of MPRS during FY 2002/2003, the development of a Monitoring 8:
Evaluation Master Plan in 2004/2005 and the conduct of the Demographic Health Survey and
the Integrated Household Survey in late 2004 and early 2005 are positive steps toward
adequate measures of performance for FY 2004/2005. However, it is recognised that
Government statistical services need further strengthening, as foreseen under the PRBS TA
component through the support to the MPRS monitoring and evaluation initiative.

The drafting of the PAF and the subsequent selection of indicators to rule the release of the
variable tranches of the PRBS programme takes the above into consideration. The variable
tranche gives an equal weight, in aggregate, to PFM indicators and social sector indicators,
while the individual weights of the PFM indicators are slightly higher than those of social
sector indicators (€1M against €0.6M): incentives are then provided for GoM to deliver on
PFM issues while striking a reasonable balance between PFM reform and public service
delivery. If deemed necessary, PAF indicators will be revised by (ROM and EC on an annual
basis. However, the list of indicators, baseline and targets used for the variable tranche of the
PRBS instalment n5 (see Annex 1) can not be modified once the Financing Agreement has
been signed. The indicators, baselines and targets presented in, Annex 1 will serve as
reference to design the PRBS 2 in 2006. The discussion with regard to next programme
indicators and targets will take place through the CABS process and draw from the revised
PAF —— annual reviews are foreseen — and new development policies and programmes due to
be developed by the Government of Malawi by end of 2005.

b. General conditions for disbursement of all tranches
T he following requirements are made prior to signing the Financing Agreement."

0 Export statistics to allow for FLEX instalments calculation (Instalment 1,3 and
3bis).

Speciﬁc requirement for the release oft/4e various tranches are presented below:
Instalment nl and n2 will be released upon signature of the FA.

Instalment n3 will be released once EC HQ authorises the release of funds on the basis
of preliminary export statistics provided by GoM,.

Instalment n4 will be released after an overall assessment by the EC shortly after the
release of the ﬁnalised CABS review Aide Memoire in February 2006.

Instalment n3 bis (remaining 20% of instalment 3 tentative total amount) will be
released once EC HQ authorises the release of funds on the basis of consolidated export
statistics provided by GoM, tentatively in October 2006.

 

Instalment n0 ‘1’ — FLEX FY 2002/2003 - tentatively €6M (100%) ——
Tentatively July 2005

Amount at stake will vary in line with export statistics provided by GoM. The total Flex
fund is €10M to be distributed between instalment l, 3 and 3bis. €6M is a tentative
ﬁgure for Instalment 1.

In line with FLEX guidelines, the support for short term ﬂuctuation in export earnings
shall be disbursed as a unique tranche immediately after the signing of the Financing
Agreement. Conditions for signing the Financing Agreement and General condition for
instalments release are presented in section 2.3 and Annex 1. On the basis of the
consolidated export statistics and ﬁnal budget deﬁcit ﬁgures provided by the GoM in
January 2005, 100% ofthe expected allocation for FY2002/2003 would be released. The
Instalment no] will be transferred to the RBM for further credit to GOM account n01.

Any unspent amount in relation to Instalment No] will be reallocated to Instalments 4
and 4bis.

Instalment no ‘2’ — Budget Support FY04/05 - €8M —— Tentatively July 2005.

The Instalment n02 is a ﬁxed tranche of €8M released as a unique tranche immediately
after signing of the Financing Agreement. Conditions for signing the Financing
Agreement and General condition for instalments release are presented in section 2.3
and Annex 1. The lnstalment n02 will be transferred to the REM for further credit to
GoM account n01.

Instalment ‘3’ and ‘3 bis’ - FLEX FY2003/2004 - Tentatively €4M
(80%/20%) —- Tentativer March 2006 / October 2006.

Amount at stake will vary in line with export statistics provided by GoM. The total Flex
fund is €10M to be distributed between instalment 1, 3 and 3bis. €4M is a tentative

In line with FLEX guidelines, the support for short term fluctuation in export: earnings
will be calculated on the basis of the provisional export statistics provided by the (30M.
An advance of 80% of the 64M — Instalment no 3 — will be transferred once preliminary
export statistics would have been communicated to the Delegation of the European
Commission and once the general conditions in section 2.3 for instalment release are
met.

The amounts mobilised will be adjusted by a common agreement between, the
Commission and the GoM in light of the ﬁnal consolidated export statistics and the ﬁnai
ﬁgure of the Budget deﬁcit. The remaining 20% — lnstalment no 3 his —will be paid upon
reception of the consolidated ﬁgures, and once general conditions for instalment release
are met, assuming that consolidated ﬁgures conﬁrm the eligibility of the country to
FLEX support. If the consolidated trade statistics show a revised situation in which
eligibility criteria are no longer met, the advance received —the instalment 3 — must be
fully reimbursed (in Euro). If the deﬁnitive amount of support based on consolidated
trade statistics is inferior to the amount advanced, the difference must be reimbursed (in
Euro). Reimbursed amounts shall remain allocated to the B —envelop of the National
Indicative Programme.

 

lnstalment 3 and 3bis will be transferred to the RBM for further credit to GOM account
n01. Any unspent amount will remain allocated to the VB envelop of the National
Indicative Programme.

c. Areas in which speciﬁc conditions for disbursement of variable tranches will be defined

Speciﬁc conditions will govern the release of lnstalment 4 ~ Budget Support FY
2005/06 — Max €20.5M - Tentatively March 2006

The fourth instalment includes a Fixed Tranche and a Variable Tranche in line with the
European Commission budget support approach. The Fixed Tranche is ﬁxed at €8.5M.
The Variable Tranche will be a maximum amount of €12M and will be based on
Government performance assessed through 16 selected indicators from the agreed upon
Performance Assessment Framework. Both tranches will be released in a unique
instalment as soon as the amount of the Variable Tranche is ﬁnalised and the general
conditions for instalment release -— see section 2.3 and Annex 1 — are satisﬁed.

The Variable Tranche will be based on 6 indicators related to PFM and 10 indicators
related to social sectors achievement. To initiate the assessment process the GOM will
provide an analysis of the development and results achieved, and point out any external
factors that influenced the results. For each indicator a score shall be calculated: 100%
for full achievement, 50% for substantial positive progress ( half of the expected
progress) but failure to reach the target, or 0% for minimal or no progress (achievement
below of equal to baseline, or failure to calculate the result). Each indicator has a weight
summing up to 100% (equivalent to €12 million for the all variable tranche): 8.3% for
each of the 6 PFM indicators (equivalent to £31 million per PFM indicator) and 5% for
each of the 10 social indicators (equivalent to €600.000 per social indicator). Formula
for tranche calculation is presented below.

The calculated results will be discussed at a meeting between responsible line
Ministries, MoF, and the European Commission, preferably in the context of the CABS
February 2006 review or shortly afterward. Once the Variable Tranche is calculated. the
instalment no 4 (ﬁxed+variable) will be released in one instalment to the RBM account,
for further credit to GOM account nol. The Balance of the Variable Tranche will not be
disbursed and will be returned to the A envelop of the National Indicative Progranune.
The 16 indicators selected for the variable tranche are presented in Annex 1.

3. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Evaluation and Audit arrangement will be conducted as per EC guidelines. Given the short
life span of the PRBS, only end of programme audit and evaluation will be carried out, in
close coordination with other partners” initiative related to BS such as the Global Budget
Support Evaluation programme.

A provision for audit is foreseen in the budget of this Financing Agreement. It is agreed that

the Principal Authorisin g Ofﬁcer — inline with article 23 of the 9th EDF Financial Regulation
— can make use of the provision to carry out an audit independently from the expenditures
made under this ﬁnancing agreement. Audit and evaluation contracts, as well as Framework
Contract are always implemented by the Commission, on the behalf and for the beneﬁt of the

ACP states.

4. GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS, MAJOR RISKS, REMEDIAL MEASURES

The required annual economic growth target of more than 6% to reduce the numbers of
Malawians living in poverty is not easy to achieve, as the economy is fragile and subject to
external factors and shocks outside the direct control of the authorities.

The country will require substantial international donor support for the foreseeable future. It
is assumed that CABS will continue budgetary support efforts after the present intervention.
Indeed, the domestic debt will remain a key constraint on the budget for the coming years: in
addition to inﬂow of donor funds, the GoM is committed to ﬁscal discipline, expenditure
control and debt restructuring. However, restructuring of domestic debt can only be
undertaken once macro-economic stability is maintained and Government credibility

restored.

Limited human and institutional capacities represent a further risk and the full impact of the
AIDS pandemic has yet to be felt.

The GoM has committed itself to reform public ﬁnance management, but need to reinforce
structures to satisfactorily comply with Cotonou requirements. The agreed actions will
require close monitoring. This ultimately depend on the political will to implement good

governance

Programme disbursements are therefore conditional to progression in respect of certain key
indicators and variables relating to the Anti corruption bureau, the Auditor General Office
and provisions of adequate checks and balances.

It is assumed that results are of such a magnitude as to cause a sustainable impact to the
macro—economic situation of the country and that progress reviews are linked to CABS or
other instruments that safeguard the continuity or impact of the intervention.

It is assumed that disbursement of funds can be correlated with factors that have a causal
connection to government performance within the given time—span, whereas many indicators
may result of interventions long before the programme period or outside government control.

It is assumed that the indicators chosen are valid, reliable and made public. Malawi statistics
in general are not entirely reliable or adequate, and statements of national accounts are

frequently belated, thus constituting a risk factor.

It is ﬁnally assumed that the indicative calendar is realistic and feasible. In practice the ﬁrst
disbursements will occur during summer 2005 and all funds will be released by June 2006, to
the exception of the 2nd tranche of 2004 ﬂex (20%) and the funds earmarked for Technical
Assistance for which implementation period will be until June 2008 (year+3).

 

5. MEASURES ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY

Pace of reforms and long—term development objectives

The full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was endorsed by the Boards of the IMF and World
Bank in July 2002, and has subsequently been subject to reviews. The timely provision. of
reliable data for key development indicators which is the core objective of the MIPRS
Monitoring and Evaluation Master Plan remain a key challenge for Gold in the coming years.

The MPRS will come to an end in 2005. The GoM has indicated that the next poverty
reduction programme will be based on the Malawi Economic Growth Strategy and the
economic vision of the new Government. Prior to the comprehensive review of the MPRS
and the design of the future poverty reduction document, in order to feed into the next lMF
PRGF programme and the budget for FY 2005/2006, the Government is currently developing
a transitional economic development agenda. The EC Delegation is a member of the task,
force set to assist with the design of the transitional programme.

With regards to the monitoring and evaluation, the GoM has demonstrated its commitment to
implement the road map that was agreed with donor in 2004. Efforts are being made to
establish a serious M&E network throughout the country and studies/survey (such as the
Demographic and Health Survey, the Integrated Household Survey) have been conducted up
until mid 2005. The results of these surveys, together with the data collected by GoM will
provide sufficient data to assess the progress made over the last 3 year of MPRS
implementation. Regardless of the overall result, the review conducted in 2005 will set the
baseline for the future GoM development and poverty reduction programme. ’

Cross-cutting issues: environment and gender

Malawi has recognised that poverty is both cause and effect of environmental degradation.
The current programme, through supporting the budget and poverty reduction policies, will
have positive effects on the environment as poverty often negatively affects the environment.

Some of the assessment indicators for the country performance, extracted from the PAP, will
be gender-disaggregated and will reﬂect women health and empowerment: enrolment rates,
women in decision making positions and births attended by skilled health, staff are selected
indicators used in the variable tranche of Instalment n5.

HIV/AIDS covers all areas of public services (education, health, gender and social
community etc.) and has an impact on all sections of the Malawi society. The PAF includes
one indicator related to HIV/AIDS issues in the country and the same indicator will be used
in the calculation of the variable tranche of instalment n5.
