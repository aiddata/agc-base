payment on the date immediately following the date of expiry of the aforesaid
moratorium period. Exim Bank shall advise the Borrower of the repayment schedule
relating to the Credit soon after disbursement of the ﬁrst Advance. Provided However

Contract that may have remained undrawn on the relevant Terminal
Disbursement Date shall be payable within ten Business Days from such
Terminal Disbursement Date.

7.2 No portion of commitment fee shall be refundable by Exim Bank to the
Borrower even if disbursement of the whole or any part of the Eligible Value of
an Eligible Contract may not materialise for any reason whatsoever.

Default Interest

8.1 If there shall be a default by the Borrower in the payment of any sum when due
under this Agreement, the Borrower shall pay to Exim Bank additional interest
by way of liquidated damages on the defaulted amount(s) from the due date to

pa. (two per cent per annum) over and above the Interest Rate.

8.2 Interest at the rate as aforesaid shall accrue from day to day, shall be calculated
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and 360 days a year factor.

Mumbai - 400 005

Re: Credit Line of
to

 

 

1, (NAME), a Counsel and Legal Adviser to the Ministry of ,
Government of (“the Government”) have examined a copy of the Dollar
Credit Line Agreement ("the Agreement") dated between Export—Import Bank of
India (Exim Bank) and the Government for a Credit Line of (“the
Credit”) agreed to be made available by Exim Bank to the Government.

In connection with this opinion I have examined the constitution, laws, decrees, judicial
decisions, rules and regulations of (“the Republic”) and such agreements,
instruments, documents and other matters as I have considered necessary or desirable for the
opinions hereinafter expressed.

Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that :

(a) the Government has full power and authority to execute and deliver the Agreement and
to perform its obligations thereunder;

(b) Mr. and / Mr. , the ofﬁcial(s) representing the Ministry
of , Government of the Republic who has/have signed the Agreement
on behalf of the Government has/have full power and authority to execute and deliver
the Agreement and all documents pursuant thereto in the name and on behalf of the
Government;

(0) all legislative, administrative and other governmental actions and statutory and other
approvals and permissions required in the Republic for (i) the execution and delivery
by the Government of the Agreement and all documents in pursuance thereof, (ii) the
borrowings by the Government under the Agreement and (iii) all payments to be made
by the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, have been
obtained and are in full force and effect without any restriction, and the Agreement as

(d)

*(i)

executed and delivered constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the
Government enforceable in law and in accordance with its terms;

the Government is subject to civil and commercial law and to legal/arbitration
proceedings with respect to its obligations under the Agreement and all documents
executed pursuant thereto, and the borrowing of the Credit, execution and delivery of
the Agreement and the performance by the Government of its obligations thereunder
constitute/will constitute private and commercial acts and not governmental or public
acts;

neither the execution and delivery of the Agreement nor the performance of its
obligations under the Agreement nor compliance with the terms and conditions thereof
will (i) conﬂict with any present law, regulation, treaty or rule of the Republic or any
order of any judicial or other authority, (ii) result in any breach of any of the terms of,
or constitute a default under, any agreement or other instrument to which the
Government is a party or is subject or by which it or any of its property is bound, (iii)
result in the creation or imposition of any encumbrance on any of the Government's
property assets or revenues or (iv) require approval of any other lenders to the
Government;

the Government is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which
it may be bound;

the obligations of the Government under the Agreement and all documents executed in
pursuance thereof, constitute the direct, general and unconditional obligations of the
Government and, with the exception of priority enjoyed by obligations which are
mandatorily preferred by law, rank and will rank at least pari passu with all present and
future unsecured indebtedness of the Government;

it is not necessary in order to ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or
admissibility in evidence of the Agreement in the Republic that it or any other
document be ﬁled, notarised, registered, recorded or enrolled with any court or
authority there or that any stamp, registration or similar tax be paid on or in relation. to
the Agreement;

there is no restriction imposed in the Borrower’s Country which limits or prevents the
transfer of foreign exchange by the Borrower for the purpose of performing any of its
payment obligations under the Credit Agreement;

although there are foreign exchange restrictions under the laws of the Republic on the
ransactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Government has made satisfactory
arrangements to ensure that requisite amount of foreign exchange will be available to
enable the Government to meet its liability for making payments when due under the
Agreement;

under the existing applicable law, there is no income—tax or other tax in the Republic
imposed by withholding, which the Government would be otherwise required to deduct
from or pay on any amount of payment to be made by the Government under the
Agreement;

under the existing applicable law, there is income—tax in or of the Republic imposed by
withholding or otherwise, which the Government would be required to pay in respect of
any payment when made by the Government under the Agreement or is imposed on or
by virtue of execution, delivery or performance of the Agreement; it is however
permissible under the laws of the Republic to gross up such payments so that Exim
Bank can receive such payment from the Government which it would otherwise receive
had there been no withholding of tax to be made by the Government;

it is not necessary under any law, rule or regulation of the Republic
(a) in order to enable Exim Bank to enforce its rights under the Agreement or

(b) by reason of Exim Bank entering into the Agreement or exercising its rights or
performing its obligations thereunder

that Exim Bank is required to be licenced, qualiﬁed or otherwise needs to carry on
business in the Republic;

Exim Bank shall not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in. the
Republic by reason only of the entering into of the Agreement or the exercise of its
rights or the performance of its obligations thereunder;

neither the Government nor any of its properties, assets or revenues is entitled to any
right of immunity or privilege from service of process, attachment (whether prior to the
entry of or in aid of execution upon a judgement) or set—off, arbitration proceedings,
judgement, execution, or from any other legal process in the Republic on, the grounds of
sovereignty or otherwise, and the waiver contained in the Agreement of any right of
such immunity and privilege by the Government is irrevocably binding on the
Government;

the choice of Indian law to govern the Agreement and all documents executed in.
pursuance thereof is a valid choice of law and the agreement by the Government to
submission of any dispute to arbitration is valid under the laws of the Republic;

any arbitral award obtained by Exim Bank, in respect of any dispute arising under the
Agreement shall be conclusive evidence of the amount of its indebtedness under the
Agreement and will be recognised and enforced in the Republic on the strength of a
duly certiﬁed true copy of the award in accordance with the ordinary procedure
applicable under the laws of the Republic for enforcement of foreign arbitral award,
without any requirement of ﬁling a suit on such award in the courts of the Republic.

.31.

 

The opinions herein expressed are limited to the matters governed by the laws of the Republic
as applicable to the Government and I express no opinion as to the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

Yours faithfully,
