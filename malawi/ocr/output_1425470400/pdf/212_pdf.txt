1 SUMMARY

The overall objective of the Income Generation Public Work Programme (IGPWP) is to
contribute to the Malawi Govemment’s objective of poverty reduction in line with the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDSI).

The second phase of the IGPWP will use lessons learnt from the ﬁrst phase of the programme to
implement a labour intensive programme with the aim of promoting income generating activities
as well as productive activities for the rural and pen-urban poor, assisting them to promote
sustainable livelihoods. The following thematic or crosscutting themes will continue to be
addressed: HIV and AIDS, gender issues, environmental issues, institutional development and
capacity building and programme visibility.

The programme purpose is to enhance the socio-economic situation of the rural/peri-urban
population through improving accessibility, infrastructure and promotion of productive activities
within rural/peri-urban areas and by creating linkages to economic activities.

The second phase of IGPWP will build on the achievements made in the ﬁrst phase of the
programme by enabling the poor both improved access as well as increased income through
community based road rehabilitation and road maintenance, forestry and irrigation development.
A major emphasis of the IGPWP is to provide a link between income generation and productive
activities within the communities through practical and sustainable approaches.

Apart from improved access to markets and social facilities, through roads improvement, people
living with HIV and AIDS will also beneﬁt from the programme as their guardians will increase
their incomes through participating in this programme. In some areas, where HIV and AIDS
support groups exist, they will be linked to the programme directly. The programme will
indirectly enhance the capacities of the District Assemblies (DAs) in management of public works
pr0jects.

The IGPWP is being implemented from July 2005 to June 2011 in two phases. The programme is
split into two phases to facilitate the scaling-up of the Districts Assemblies involvement and of the
GoM contribution. The ﬁrst three years have been used to strengthen capacity at DA level. In the
second phase, the DAs will directly implement many of the activities themselves.

The whole programme, which received a favourable opinion of the EDF Committee in May 2005,
runs from July 2005 to June 2011 with a total EDF contribution of €25 million. The phase I FA
signed in July 2005 was for an amount of €15,512,500. This second FA is for the second phase of
the programme for an amount of €9,487,500.

 

' The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy is the GoM’s overarching statement of the development policy
and proVides a guiding framework for development partners and has since replaced the Malawi Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) which was in force at the design phase of the programme.

 

2. INTERVENTION
2.1 Overall objective

The overall objective of the Income Generation Public Work Programme (IGPWP) is to
contribute to the Malawi Government’s objective of poverty reduction in line with the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDSZ). The IGPWP Phase II will use lessons learnt from
Phase I of IGPWP to implement a labour intensive programme with the aim of promoting income
generating activities as well as productive activities for the rural and peri-urban poor, assisting to
promote sustainable livelihoods.

2.2 Programme purpose

The programme purpose is to enhance the socio-economic situation of the rural/peri-urban
population through improving accessibility, infrastructure and promotion of productive activities
within rural/peri-urban areas and by creating linkages to economic activities.

The IGPWP as a whole builds on the gains made in the earlier 8th EDF EU/GoM PWP by
enabling the poor both improved access as well as income through community based road
rehabilitation and road maintenance, forestry and irrigation development. A major emphasis of the
IGPWP is to provide a link between income generation and productive activities within the
communities through practical and sustainable approaches.

2.3 Expected results of the second phase of the programme

Result 1 - Rural roads and small bridges are upgraded and rehabilitated

The communities will be involved in appropriate income injection activities through labour
intensive methods, which will result in upgrading of approx.630Km of roads (including drainage)
and 40 small bridges located on the identiﬁed roads in the vicinity of the beneﬁciary
villages/communities.

Result 2 - Rural roads are maintained

Village road maintenance clubs will be formed and will be involved in appropriate income
injection activities through labour intensive methods, which will result in ongoing maintenance of
approx. 4,700 Km of roads in the vicinity of the beneﬁciary villages/communities.

Result 3 - Productive local forestry activities are developed (comprising agroforestry, fuel
wood, timber and fruit tree plantations)

Communities will be encouraged to form village forestry clubs, who will be empowered regarding
the beneﬁts of reforestation/tree planting/agroforestry and will be provided with inputs and
training so that they can create their own tree nurseries and tree plantations (both communal and
individual as appropriate). 700 village forestry clubs are expected to be established including bank

accounts and a total of 12.5million trees planted resulting in an area of 1,800 ha under natural
forest regeneration.

Result 4 - Productive local agricultural activities are developed through improved inputs
and irrigation

Communities will be sensitized on the beneﬁts of irrigation activities that use efﬁcient water
harvesting and storage compatible with sustainable water resources management and with the
needs of downstream users. They will be empowered and encouraged to form village irrigation

Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) which was in force at the design phase of the programme.

 

 

clubs. The clubs will be assisted to initiate a variety of demand driven activities which will
improve sustainability and result in improved income generation from surplus food production.
The irrigation schemes will comprise gravity-fed surface irrigation, water harvesting and storage
and use of treadle pumps and other appropriate small scale technologies. A total area of 400ha is
expected to be under irrigation covering approximately 250 irrigation clubs.

Result 5 - Programme management is adequately addressing crosscutting issues

The programme management unit for the IGPWP will be constituted in such a way to pay
particular attention to essential crosscutting issues such as HIV/AIDS and gender equality, human
rights, access to other social economic initiatives, environmental management and programme
visibility. Some sub-results are expected such as:

HIV and AIDS awareness is promoted: The IGPWP will facilitate linkages between the beneﬁciary
communities and HIV and AIDS programmes/initiatives, so that the communities derive beneﬁts from
these as well. The village clubs of all kinds will form an ideal forum for HIV and AIDS programmes to
engage with the communities, thus improving the linkage between communities and HIV and AIDS
initiatives. Vulnerable persons such as those living with HIV and/or AIDS, chronic diseases, orphans,
the elderly, individuals looking after the vulnerable will beneﬁt from both the IGPWP and from linkages
to other socio economic initiatives.

Role of women and youth in household income generation and decision-making is increased:
Speciﬁc targets will be set and monitored for employment and representation of women and youth. Thus
women and youth (18-25 years old) will earn income as they participate in the IGPWP activities and
will be represented in decision—making forums.

Linkages are facilitated to other socio-economic activities for the rural poor: The IGPWP will
facilitate linkages between the beneﬁciary communities and other willing development
programmes/initiatives, so that the communities derive beneﬁts not only from the IGPWP, but from the
other programmes as well.

Environmental Management

The IGPWP will ensure that environmental issues are addressed in all the three components either
through its prograrrnne staff or linkages with institutions addressing environmental issues with guidance
from the environmental Management plan and Malawi government policies on environment.

Programme Visibility is enhanced

The IGPWP will ensure that all activities funded by the European Union (EU) are visibly
acknowledged. This will cover the written and visual identity of the EU and will be used in brieﬁngs,
newsletters, press conferences, presentations, invitations, signs, commemorative plaques and all other
items used to highlight EU participation.

Moreover, the programme management unit for the IGPWP will create opportunities for local
programme and project managers. A Malawian programme manager will head the Programme
Management Unit (PMU) and local consultants will be appointed to carry out project management
work, and thus enhance their skills and experience.

Result 6 - Implementation capacity of district assemblies is enhanced

The implementation of the IGPWP will be continued by the DAs once they have the appropriate
capacity to do so. The capacity of the DAs will be enhanced both through cooperation and by
direct provision of capacity building relating to development planning and implementation. This
will be achieved by training and facilitating roads maintenance, forestry and irrigation staff
working, and to be employed, within the Districts in order to enable them to gradually take over
the practical implementation functions related to IGPWP interventions. This capacity building
component has been one of the core activities during phase I. In the second phase, the DAs will be

enabled, amongst other, to manage road maintenance funds including the part for public ﬁnance
(as per precondition of the 2nd phase).

 

2.4. Activities

The IGPWP is being implemented in two phases: the ﬁrst phase runs up to June 2008 and the
second runs up to June 2011. Refer to Annex 3 for a detailed timetable of activities of the
programme. Previous experience together with consultation of key stakeholders indicated that
such a programme timeframe would allow time for adequate capacity building of the District
Assemblies and the creation of a GoM road maintenance fund. GoM’s ﬁnancial contribution is
envisaged as follows:

2008/09: 50 % of the requested funds to maintain the roads rehabilitated in the ﬁrst phase
2009/ 1 0: 100% of the requested funds to maintain the roads rehabilitated in the ﬁrst phase

The second phase builds on processes put in place during the ﬁrst phase and includes
recommendations from the mid-term evaluation of phase I. Phase II continues many activities
initiated in the ﬁrst phase of the programme. The process will continue to be demand driven and
to be a bottom-up approach.

The activities related to the expected results that will be ongoing in the second phase are listed
below:

- Roads will be identiﬁed, prioritised and selected for improvement in collaboration with the
DA’s, based upon the District Development Plans (DDPs) and the Area Development
Committees (ADCs) along the selected roads will be consulted. Contractors and the
community workforce will be provided with technical assistance to carry out the work
required. A total of 630km of roads are expected to be rehabilitated using labour intensive
technologies.

o In consultation with the DAs and ADCs, village road maintenance clubs will be formed,
supported (including setting up a bank account), equipped, capacitated and trained in the work
required for ongoing maintenance of approx. 4,700Km of road (approximately 10 km per
maintenance club). The management and cost of the maintenance activities will be gradually
handed over to the DA5.

- The VDCs will be consulted and on the basis of positive response (demand) village forestry
clubs will be formed, equipped, supplied with inputs, capacitated and trained in forestry
husbandry (nursery development, planting out, and management and maintenance of
plantations and existing village forestry areas). 700 village forestry clubs will be established
including bank accounts and a total of 12.5million trees planted resulting in an area of 1,800 ha
under natural forest regeneration.

o The VDCs will be consulted and on the basis of positive response (demand) village irrigation
clubs will be formed, equipped, supplied with inputs, capacitated and trained in irrigation
techniques. A total of 400ha is expected to be under irrigation covering approximately 250
irrigation clubs

o Crosscutting issues:

- HIV and AIDS awareness is promoted The PMU will consult DAs and HIV and AIDS
programmes, cooperation agreements will be entered into with willing partners, in order to maximize
coordination and cooperation between the IGPPW and already existing HIV and AIDS programmes.
Joint planning forums will be established.

- Role of women and youth is increased: The PMU will consult with the ADCs and VDCs and
obtain commitment for the inclusion of women and youth within the income generating activities
(road rehabilitation, road maintenance, forestry, irrigation and other activities) as well as
representation in the various committees and clubs. Income received and involvement of women and
youth will be monitored. Linkages will be facilitated with willing institutions to promote gender
issues, reduce gender based violence and promote youth and women empowerment.

 

o Linkages are facilitated to other socio-economic activities: The PMU will consult DAs, other EU
funded programmes, line ministries, national bodies and other donor programmes (NGOs and
CBOs); cooperation agreements will be entered into with willing partners, in order to max1m1ze
coordination and cooperation between the IGPWP and other initiatives especially in the context of
promoting income generating activities and management of revolving group-owned funds. Joint
planning forums will be established. During the consultation and implementation of the IGPWP at
village level, other programmes will be introduced to the community. Linkages will be facilitated to
engage the clubs in other socio economic initiatives such as IGAs to improve their livelihood.

o Environmental Management: The environmental management plan formulated during the ﬁrst
phase of the programme will be implemented focusing on all three key components of the
programme. The PMU will ensure that environmental issues are addressed through creation and
strengthening of linkages with institutions addressing environmental issues with glidance from
GoM’s policies on environment.

o Programme Visibility: Visibility of EU cooperation and funding will be enhanced in a number of
creative ways and this will cover the written and visual identity of the EU and will be used in
brieﬁngs, newsletters, press conferences, presentations, invitations, signs, commemorative plaques
and all other items used to highlight EU participation, in line with the EC Visibility Guidelines.

The PMU will continue to consult with DAs and other donor programmes with regard to the
capacity enhancement needed to adequately implement the IGPWP. Based on the single point
assessments already carried out in phase I, the PMU will continue to implement the capacity
enhancing plans and based upon the proven capacity of the DAs, functions within the IGPWP
will be incrementally handed over from the PMU to the 15 DAs.

 

The Technical Assistance Team will provide speciﬁc training to the PMU staff based on training
plans formulated in phase I of the programme. Local consultants and/or local project managers
will be selected and appointed to plan and oversee the implementation of roads projects and will
be provided with technical assistance by the Technical Assistance Team.

A review of the programme’s logical framework was carried out through a consultative process
with stakeholders in the middle of the ﬁrst phase following a mid-term review of the programme
by external consultants. This was done to ensure that the contextual environment, within which
the programme is set, remains valid. Revisions have been agreed and approved by all key
stakeholders. Summary of the main results and recommendations of the mid-term review of the
ﬁrst phase and trigger evaluation for the second phase are outlined in Annex 4.

2.5 Indicators

The key indicators for assessing the success of the programme as listed in the ﬁrst FA have been
slightly adapted following recommendations of the phase I MTR (Annex 4). The revised key
indicators are listed in relation to the different results in the Logical Framework (Annex 1). The
indicators will be used to measure the outputs of the different activities, their direct effects on the
beneﬁciaries and the change that they inﬂuence in the livelihoods of the recipient communities.

An independent Monitoring Consultant recruited during the ﬁrst phase of the programme has
developed a Monitoring and Information System that is linked to the output reports required by
both the GoM and the EU. The Monitoring System established in the ﬁrst phase of the
programme will be used to assess the indicators listed in Annex 6. In order to assess the impact
and outcome of the programme; the indicators will be compared with those in the baseline survey.
An impact study will be conducted mid way in phase II of the programme.

 

3. IMPLEMENTATION

3.1. Physical and non physical means

Physical means shall include rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads and small-scale
communal irrigation schemes using labour intensive methods, as well as facilitation of inputs for

forestry and irrigation productive activities.

Non-physical means include facilitation, coordination, management and monitoring. The
responsibility for the programme lies with the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development (MoLG&RD) and the programme is managed through a Programme Management
Unit (PMU), supported by relevant Technical Assistance (TA). Technical assistance is provided to
the programme in the form of long-term TA throughout the programme implementation period.
The areas of expertise are Programme Management, Contracts Management and Financial
Management. In addition, there will be a need for short—term TA to support particular activities.
An independent monitoring consultant (MC) has designed a monitoring system for
implementation over the duration of the programme. Local consultants and/or local Project
Managers will be contracted to design and oversee the roads components in support of DAs.

3.2 Organisational and implementation procedures

The National Authorising Ofﬁcer (NAO) is the Contracting Authority and has overall
responsibility for the implementation of the programme. Backstopping by the designated Desk
Ofﬁcer(s) in the NAO Support Unit will also help facilitate the smooth running of the programme.

In accordance with Article 35(1) of Annex IV to the Cotonou Agreement, the NAO will delegate
to the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MoLG&RD), programme
supervisor, his powers of implementation. The detailed modalities of this delegation, including
the exact level of powers, authorised thresholds for public procurement and grants delegated by
the NAG to the Imprest Administrator (IA) and the Imprest Accounting Ofﬁcer (IAO), will be
deﬁned in the overall work plan and programme estimates in respect of the 9th EDF regulations.
The IA and the IAO shall be assigned to the management and implementation of the project by the
NAG or his representative in agreement with the Head of Delegation.

In accordance with the powers delegated to them by the NAG, the IA and the IAO shall draw up
and implement consecutive programme-estimates, award contracts and grants, commit
expenditure and make the corresponding payments.

The IA and the IAO shall submit their technical and ﬁnancial reports to the NAO or his
representative and to the Head of delegation.

A Programme Steering Committee (PSC) has been set up to oversee and validate the overall
direction and policy of the programme, and to follow all programme activities and budget. The
PSC meets at least twice a year. It is responsible for approving the programme-estimates drawn up
by the Imprest Administrator and the Imprest Accounting Ofﬁcer. The PSC is chaired by the
NAO or his representative and will consist of a representative of the MoLG&RD - programme
supervisor, the IA and the IAO for the programme designated in the programme-estimates, a
representative of the EU Delegation with observer status. Representation from NGOs, the civil
society and all involved line ministries is part of the PSC or its Technical Sub-committees.

A Programme Management Unit (PMU) has been established under the authority of the
MoLG&RD. The PMU will conduct operations through Programme-estimates using a substantial
direct labour component. The preparation, management and implementation of the programme-
estimates must comply with rules set out in the latest Practical guide to management of direct-
labour operations and programme-estimates ﬁnanced by the EDF and the BUDGET. The

der Phase I. The call for tender covered the whole

duration of the 2 phases programme, however a special clause speciﬁes that an extension to the
contract may be awarded to cover the 2nd phase of the programme ﬁnanced from the resources of
the second FA, subject to the signature of this FA and a positive assessment of the contractor’s
performances to be conducted at least six months before the end of the ﬁrst contract. According to
Decision 2/2002 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 7/10/2002 (point 10.1.2.c, additional
services) a direct award for a new contract to the contractor of 1St phase will be done following the
negotiated procedure. Should the performance assessment prove negative a new recruitment will
be conducted following the initial procedure. In addition, there will be a need for short-term TAs
to support particular activities and to be recruited using the framework contract procedure for
speciﬁc commitments or the simpliﬁed procedure when ﬁnanced under the direct labour
component of the Programme Estimate. An independent monitoring consultant (MC) has designed
a monitoring system for implementation over the entire programme implementation period. Local
consultants and/or local Project Managers will be contracted (under the programme estimate) to
design and oversee the roads components in support of DAs

The programme is being implemented within the existing framework for decentralisation (details
are set up in Annex 7). Each District Assembly is being progressively assisted to take over project
planning and implementation functions. Reporting and working methodologies have been
formulated during phase I of the programme.

3.3 Appropriate technology

The use of appropriate technologies that are more environmentally friendly, sustainable and suited
to indigenous skills and ﬁnancial resources shall be promoted in the programme. The programme
shall give emphasis to the lessons learnt and the experiences of other projects where such
activities have been used. Appropriate labour intensive methods will be used together with local
materials wherever feasible.

3.4 Timetable, cost and financing plan

The whole programme is designed to cover the period from July 2005 to June 2011, split into
two phases.

A single ﬁnancing proposal (FP) for the ﬁll] amount covering the entire period of execution of the
programme received the favourable opinion of the EDF committee in May 2005.

For each phase a Commission’s ﬁnancing decision will be taken for the amount allocated to each
phase and a ﬁnancmg agreement (FA) signed for the same amount, covering the corresponding
period of implementation and execution.

For each phase the FA shall be concluded by 31 December of the year following the year in
which the global ﬁnancial commitment was adopted. Failing this, the corresponding
appropriations shall be cancelled.

This FA is signed for the second phase only.

The date of the end of the period of operational implementation of the 2nd Financing Agreement
IS set at 30/06/2011 and the date of the end of period of execution of the 2“1 FA is thereby set at
30/06/2013. Any balance of funds remaining available under the EC grant shall be automatically
cancelled 6 months after the end of the period of execution of the Financing Agreement. For the

The Commission’s decision covering the second phase and signature of th1s FA has been subject
to the conﬁrmation by an evaluation of the programme carried out within'the second year of
implementation of the ﬁrst phase. The mid-term evaluation has proposed mlnor adjustments for

the second phase that do not modify the “spirit of the initial programme’s FP’.

The performance of contracts to implement the project, whether ﬁnanced under the imprest
component of the budget of programme estimate or by speciﬁc individual ﬁnancial commitments,
excluding contracts for audits and ﬁnal evaluations and, where applicable, any technical assistance
contracts concerning the ﬁnancial closure of the project, may under no circumstances be
prolonged beyond the end of the operational implementation phase of the corresponding ﬁnancing

agreement.

From a total programme cost estimated at € 25 million ﬁnanced from the resources of the A
envelope of the NIP, 6 15,512,500 were allocated to the ﬁrst FA covering phase I and € 9,487,500
are allocated to this FA covering phase II of the programme.

3.5 Accompanying measures to be taken by the Government

Sustainability for ongoing maintenance of the rural road network is essential and for this reason
the GoM is implementing signiﬁcant reforms to the road sector to rationallze malntenance and
funding of the National Roads Network. The reforms (road reclassiﬁcatlon, d1v1sron of
responsibility) will ensure that many of the roads rehabilitated in phase I of IGPWP (reclassrﬁed
District roads) are maintained by the Roads Authority, from the Road Fund.

Previously the National Roads Authority combined the ﬁlnctions of funding and operations, and
new legislation was required to separate these functions. Enabling legislation is now in place, and
the responsible Boards have been appointed at the end of 2006.

The GoM has indicated in its letter (Ref.No. DAD/5/1/5/20/11014/pks) dated 18th June 2007 that
funds for maintenance of roads rehabilitated under phase I of the programme will be made
available to the Supervising Ministry which will in turn utilise the Local Government Finance
Committee to disburse the funds to the local assemblies. The GoM contribution will cover 50% of
the maintenance costs (approx. €250,000) in the ﬁrst year of this phase of the programme and this
ﬁrst allocation will be made from the 2008/09 national budget. The GoM contribution will be
raised to 100% (approx. €600,000) in the second and ﬁnal year of the programme.

Accompanying measures to be taken by GoM will be to ensure that each DA is allocated
sufﬁcient funds to maintain those roads upgraded during the ﬁrst phase of IGPWP. 50% of the
requested funds shall be GoM contribution. This precondition is to be in place before activities
commence under this Financing Agreement.

4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
4.1 Monitoring arrangements and follow-up

An independent Monitoring Consultant (MC) was appointed and has been monitoring the ﬁrst
phase of IGPWP. The MC has established a monitoring and information system (MIS) within the
ﬁrst 18 months of operation linked to the output reports required by GoM and the EU. The
indicators incorporated within the system are shown in Annex 7. An important principle is that the
IGPWP MIS has been harmonised with the systems used by the DAs, e. g. the district databank, in
order to ensure that common datasets are shared at local and national level. This has also ensured
compatibility between the IGPWP reporting formats and the district based MIS systems. The MC
has also established a baseline survey within the ﬁrst 18 months of the programme against which
the impact of the programme can be measured. Gender analysis is also part of the monitoring
systems.

A new independent Monitoring Consultant (MC) will be appointed at the beginning of Phase II to
continue monitoring the programme. An international restricted tender procedure will be launched
in order to sign a service contract with the new MC. The MC will review the established MIS and
update it if necessary.

4.2 Reviews, evaluations and audits

Technical evaluation shall be undertaken at the end of programme by an independent,
international team of consultants. There shall be an end of programme review, conducted by
external consultants selected by the EU. The indicators established during the ﬁrst phase will be
used to measure the performance of the second phase.

The programme expenditure will be subject to an external audit every quarter. In any event, when
total expendlture incurred by the imprest component of the budget of a programme estimate
amounts to the equlvalent of EUR 200,000 or more, veriﬁcation of these expenditures by an

 

external auditor has to be done before submission of the closure request of that programme
estimate. These audits will verify the programme’s accounts and certify that the expenditure by
the direct-labour component of the programme-estimates was committed, validated and paid in
accordance with the programme, the budget allocation and the technical and administrative
implementing arrangements, the procedures for awarding EDF contracts and grants, the rules of
the Practical Guide to Procedures for Programme Estimates Financed by the EDF and BUDGET
and generally accepted accountancy principles. Audits may also be conducted on the systems and
procedures introduced, where necessary.

In addition, the Commission can use budget's audit provision to organise an independent audit.

Audit and evaluation contracts and framework contracts are always concluded by the Commission
acting for and on behalf of the ACP State or States concerned.

ANNEX 4

ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS

1. ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS

A number of assumptions and risks have been identiﬁed during Phase 1 of this programme.

1.1 Assumptions underlying the project intervention

It is assumed that GOM will: continue its eﬂorts to stabilise the macro—economic and
political environment.

The Government of Malawi has so far shown commitment in creating a stable political
environment. A concerted effort is being made to eradicate corruption and stamp out
elements that do not contribute to the grth and future of Malawi. This is evident in
the positive economic growth rate of the country when compared to previous years,
(2.3% for 2005 and 7.9% for 2006). The commitment of government towards the
decentralising effort will also trickle down to encourage a progressive and stable
environment at this level.

GOM will provide the political commitment necessary to honour the set pre—conditions
outlined in the Financing Agreement.

The positive impact and success of the GOM/EU PWP as well as Phase 1 of IGPWP
have been achieved with the enthusiastic support of GoM. GoM, through the Ministry
of Local Government and Rural Development, has been an active partner of IGPWP.
This positive support and continued involvement has ensured the commitment
necessary to honour the set pre-conditions for the success of the programme. The
establishment of the Roads Authority and the Road Fund are indications of this.

GOM will adequately fund and capacitate the DAs.

A core result of the programme is building the capacity of the DA5. The DAs are
playing an instrumental role in the implementation of the projects in the districts. The
DAs have varying capacity but in general it is below what is needed to be able to fully
manage and implement projects independently. GoM, through its decentralization drive
and the forthcoming implementation of the Local development Fund, has shown its
support to the DAs to ensure that they are adequately equipped to be part of the
programme with sufﬁcient resources.

N0 catastrophic emergency situations will arise to alter this course of events.

Although some emergency situations have been identiﬁed as risks, it is assumed that no
situation, over which some sort of control is exercisable, will arise to inﬂuence the
implementation of this programme.

1.2 Risks
0 Lack of adequate capacity to implement the programmes within the District Assemblies.

The DAs are mostly dependant on Central Government for resources. Although the
GoM has indicated its support to the proposed programme, various factors might hinder
it in providing the needed support to the DA5 in time. Speciﬁcally in terms of staff and
other resources. A core result of the programme is the building of the capacity of the
DAs, which will speciﬁcally address these shortages in the context of the
implementation of the programme. The forthcoming implementation of the Local
Development Fund will ensure that adequate ﬁnancial resources are available to
implement and sustain programme initiatives

0 Occurrence of drought or ﬂoods during the programme period.

Although the risk of any circumstances of force majeure is generally small, it is always
present and might have an inﬂuence on the implementation of the programme. Over the
lifespan of the previous programme as well as Phase 1 of the present programme, there
have been some occurrences of ﬂoods, droughts and irregular rainfall. It was however
successfully managed and the programme even responded positively to these and in fact
assisted in mitigating the adverse effects of such occurrences.

0 Lack of funding for road maintenance at district level.

The funding of road maintenance by GoM has been set as a pre-condition for Phase 2 of
the programme. GoM has already shown its commitment towards the ﬁmding of road
maintenance by the establishing of the Roads Authority and Road Fund. The set-up of
appropriate disbursement structures for funds to the DA5 is in process and GoM has
ofﬁcially restated its commitment towards the availability of adequate funding for road
maintenance.

0 Lack of commitment and will on the part of collaborating institutions.

As an implementing partner, GoM has proved its commitment to the IGPWP. The DAs
are an important part of the Decentralisation Process and form an integral part in the
implementation of the IGPWP at district level. In addition all of the development
programmes in Malawi are aligned and fully support the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (MGDS).

 

 

 

ANNEX 5

Summary of Results of IGPWP Mid-Term Evaluation3

The mid—term review examined activities and processes implemented and established from August
2005 to November 2006. The mid—term review was timed to identify and alert management to
efﬁciency and effectiveness challenges that should be addressed in the remaining part of Phase I and
in phase II of the programme.

The main conclusions on relevance, efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability of the programme
including proposed recommendations are outlined below:

- The Financing Agreement for Phase II should allow some adjustment of the programme, but not
modify the spirit of the initial programme ’s Financing Agreement. The presence in the FA Overall
Objective of a commitment to “promotion of productive activities assisting to promote sustainable
livelihoods ” is wholly compatible with the Malawi Grth and Development Strategy.

- The original Financing Agreement of IGPWP had some weaknesses in translating the stated
objective and purpose into a comprehensive framework of targeted results. In particular, several
indicators have no application either as tools to guide management or to indicate the achievements
of the programme. The original FA also set out a number of trigger indicators for the second phase
that were not quantiﬁed.

- The principal conditions for proceeding with Phase H, relate to establishment of a GoM-funded
maintenance of rural roads rehabilitated by IGPWP during Phase I. The conditions are not yet met
(at the time of evaluation), but national strategic planning for road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance and their funding indicates that the indicators could be satisﬁed in the course of 2007.

- IGPWP has satisfactory internal operational procedures. Most of these procedures were developed
under the predecessor EU/GoM PWP. Programme management continues to demonstrate dexterity
in coping with cumbersome procurement procedures of the 9th EDF.

- Given the limitations of the original Financing Agreement, and difﬁculties of applying 9th EDF
procedures to small works contracts within Programme Estimates, the programme management
has implemented the roads and forestry technical components in an efﬁcient and effective manner.
The sustainability of roads rehabilitated with IGPWP assistance is not assured and must be
addressed, depending principally on the outcome of the national planning for road maintenance.
Meanwhile, roads rehabilitated under EU/GOM PWP are not being maintained by Government.
Forestry activities in many sites, under direct control of the communities, are sustainable and are
generating spontaneous initiative for more tree planting and maintenance. The effectiveness of
irrigation activities has been partly inadequate, but can be improved. New measures are required to
support development of income generating activities as part of the theme of cross-cutting issues by
creating new partner linkages and leveraging of partner resources.

- New Indicators have been recommended by the mission for Phase II to accommodate the spirit of
the FA with a tilt towards socio-economic achievement and to provide the opportunity to capture
existing achievements and impact. The table below summarises some of the achievements to date
(Phase I) and sets out revised indicators that the mission recommends.

- The existing socially organized network of 1203 assisted new clubs provides an opportunity for
enabling further interventions of IGPWP through linkages to other projects and programmes.

 

3 Mid term review of Phase I of IGPWP and the Trigger Evaluation for Phase II of the programme was
conducted by John Pratt (Socio-economist) and Jamie Newton (Rural Infrastructure Expert) from Italtrend SPA
in November 2006, the summary is an extract from the Final Report dated January 2007.

Speciﬁc recommendations offered by the mission are as follows:

Programme Steering Committee

The proposal to include NGOs and civil society in the PSC should be explored. One or more persons
with rural business/private sector experience should also join the PSC.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The Monitoring and Information System should be made operational. Further reﬁnements should be
suspended until the analysis of the initial set of ﬁeld data has been completed. Integration of the MIS
information into DA databank needs to be brought concluded. An impact survey should be conducted
midway in Phase II. Development of new and spin-off business activities and their annual revenue
streams needs to be monitored to register the effect of IGPWP and its partners on such new incomes.
The contribution of forestry and irrigation income to household welfare, and speciﬁcally on the direct
effect on the respective participating families should be monitored.

Support to Decentralization

Future programme interventions are closely linked to the priorities of DDPs to support
decentralization. Zonal technical ofﬁcers to contribute their experience to the overall District planning
process should be pursued. This will contribute to both the efﬁciency and the effectiveness of
planning.

 

 

Cross-cutting issues

As programme design failed to address the need to provide a budget line for cross-cutting issues, in
Phase II a separate budget line for this should be created. Phase II, cross-cutting issues, as deﬁned, be
mainstreamed throughout the programme and be identiﬁed as a separate Result.

PMU has much more to do to leverage impact in income generation and the technical sectors by
linking up with other programmes. This needs to be translated into practice.

The success on HIV/AIDS and other ‘soft’ issues needs to be complemented by new strategies to
cover the other components of cross-cutting issues for the rural poor. Indicators for awareness raising
on cross-cutting issues be joined by new Indicators appropriate to the recommendations for promoting
‘business’ capacity within communities, to include roads rehabilitation teams, roads maintenance
clubs, forestry clubs and irrigation clubs.

Roads

Design of phase II road rehabilitation and maintenance activities should continue unchanged. IGPWP
should actively promote labour-based maintenance to encourage its acceptance and adoption by the
Roads Authority, contractors, DAs and other development programmes. Resources are allocated from
the budget in Phase II to maintain an adequate engineering staff establishment in IGPWP to
investigate prepare and implement the roads component.

Urgent review of phase 1 roads (including those planned for PE2/PE3) to identify the new category of
each road under the proposed national reclassiﬁcation in order to estimate the budget requirements for
each DA in PE4 and PBS to maintain these roads. Road maintenance clubs be constituted to make the
club collectively responsible for an entire rehabilitated road; individual members to remain responsible
for one section (length-man system) and one of the club members to be appointed as a supervisor or
capitao.

Forestry

As social impact of the forestry component is perhaps more important than the demonstrated physical
impact the portion of programme resources assigned to forestry be increased by some 15% in Phase II
and physical planting targets be raised by 30%. The PMU's recommendation to diversify beyond
plantation (woodlot and homestead) and systematic inter-planting activities into regeneration of
Customary Forests and operate this alongside existing collaboration with Clubs should be pursued;
2,700 ha of regeneration forest could be covered in this way.

Irrigation

Resources applied to Irrigation in PE-3 and Phase II be held at their present level but be prioritized for
water harvesting and storage. The Result for the irrigation component be redrafted to emphasise
income generation, and appropriate supporting training be reinforced. Potential partnerships with
agricultural marketing support entities be explored and respective linkages established. IGPWP should
promote irrigated crops that give better cash return than grain maize and use proﬁtability as the main
criterion of success rather than yield.

Sustainability

Because projects and programmes have a ﬁnite life, IGPWP should aim for an exit strategy that leaves

behind local partnerships among civil society and with government that are durable and ﬁnancially
sustainable.
