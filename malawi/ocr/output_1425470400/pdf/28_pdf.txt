I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The HIV AIDS pandemic rages relentiessly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Women, infants and
children account for more than 60% of new HIV infections. Each year, globally, half a
million children become infected with HIV. Most of these infections are in developing
countries, and more than 90% come from mothe—to—dtild transmission. Without
intervention, there is a 30-45% chance that, in breastfeeding populations, a baby born to an
HIV positive (HIV+) mother will become infected.

Malawi, ranked as one of the world’s poorest nations, also has enact the highest HIV AIDS
prevalence rates. The N50 projected that in 2007 about 80,000 HIV positive women gave
birth, and of the exposed infants, only 15.3% received any prophylaxis. Recognizing the
urgent need to address the growing infection through vertical transmission, the Government
of Malawi (GOM) initiated a Prevention of Mother—Tearild Tmnsmission (PMTCT)
programme in 1999. The roll-out saw limited MESS until 2007 when the Ministry of
Health (MOH) initiated a ﬁve-year scale up plan. This programme has resulted in impressive
growth, but seveme limited resources hinderthe comprehensive roll out of high quality
sen/ices.

Numerous challenges and bottlenecks impededieprogramme. Thse include a critical
shortage of human resources in the health sector, a poorly managed and inconsistent supply
chain, resulting in frequent stock arts of Mal drugs and diagnostics, inadequate
infrastructure, poor transport services, and difﬁculties in community mobilisation and lack of
male involvement which hinders uptake of services and good adherence to drug regimens.
Additionally there are many difﬁculties in establishing effective home-based care, without
which it is almost impossible to achieve comprehensive patient care and follow through.

The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI) has foccsed on expanding HIV/AIDS care
globally. CHAI has worked to lower the cost oftreatment worldwide, partnered with
governments to implement largevscale treatment and prevention programmes, expanded
access to treatment in rural areas, and helped make treatment universally available for
children. In 2007 CHAI laund'red a global effort in PMTCl'.

In 2008 CHAI-Malawi plans to support the national PMTCT programme of the GOM whose
vision is an HIV-free generation. CHAI’s plan isto help achieve this vision by supporting the
comprehensive and effective implementation of all elements of the Malawi Ministry of Health
(MOH) PMTCT programme in the Machinga District, population 447,243. CHAI-Malawi has
already participated in writing Malawi’s updated ART and PMTCT guidelines.

For this proposal, CHAI has developed a comprehensive set of eight strategic actions aimed
at achieving success in prevention of infection through two primary targets:

- A signiﬁcant increase in the full range of uptake of PMTCT services
c A damatic decrease in the rate of momenta-child transmission of HIV (MTCl')

At all stages of the project CHAI will implement interventions only after consultation with
and approval from all national and local leadership in the health sector. The project plan
provides for the rapid acceleration of infrastructural enhancements in order to satisfactorily
service the intended increase in patients accessing care. CHAI will work closely with the
MOH on high quality monitoring and evaluation (NEE) in accordance with the'r guidelines,
and will also provide additional assessmetts of the programme in cooperation with the MOH
and DHO. Activities will also be evaluated to ensure sustainability. In partnership mm the
Malawi MOH, CHAI Malawi will engageaggressiveiy to demonstrate success in the PMTCI'
programme in the target district in order to create a pathway for success nationwide.

This proposal requests funding from the‘Govemment of the Kingdom of Norway for
comprehensive PMT CT support in the selected district of Machinga. The budget is
approximately $645 for each of 8,613 HIV+ mother-infantpairs in care, or $5.56 million
over three years. CHAI could later support a second district if additional funds are available.

II. CONTEXT

1. GLOBAL HIV & PMTCT CONTEXT

HIV is a global pandemic that disproportionately affects women and young children. In 2007
an estimated 33.2 million people were living with HIV worldwide, Including about 15.4
million women and 2.5 million childrai undertheage of’IS. In sub-Saharan Africa, women,
infants and children account for more than 60% of new HIV infections. Each year, half a
million children become trim with HIV. Most ofthese infections are in developing
countries, and more than 90% come from mother-Wit! transmission (also called vertical
transmission) during pregnancy, labour and deiivery, or breasfeeding. Without intervention,
there is a 30-45%1 chance that a baby born to an HIV-infected mother will become infected.

The most effective way to preventmcther—to—child bansnission of HIV involves treatment
with triple antiretroviral drug regimens and avoidance of breastfeeding. In high-income
countries, where these options have been available  mid 19905, mother-to-child
transmission (MTCT) rata have been reduced to below 2%. In the developing world,
however, prevention programmes have ban based primarily on the provision of a single-
dose of nevirapine forthe mother and infant atthe time of birth, and on adusive
breastfeeding. For the last eight vars, these interventions have been accepted as the most
logical in settings with limited health services and where follow—up was neither possible nor
expected. Most programmes focused solely on pregnant women who presented at antenatal
clinics. These efforts are hindered by low amenaiai participation, poor access to testing and
counselling, and inadequate stocks of drugs at: PMTCT sites. It is estimated that only 16%2
of pregnant women in low- and middie-incane cwntries weretiestied for HIV in 2006. While
this has increased from an estimamd 10% in 2005,there is much that needs to be done to
reduce MTCI' on a giobal scale.

2. CHAI GLOBAL PMTCT PROJECTS

The Clinton Foundation’s HIVIAIDS Initiative (CHAI) recognizes the urgent need to break
this cycle of new paediatric infections -vd1e rest majority of which are caused by vertical
transmission. CHAI is working mm 9 partner governmentsin demonstrate that it is possible
to dramatically reduce MTCT in resource—poor settings by increasing the delivery of
comprehensive and high quality PMTCT  This is predicated upon offering a fee-
free, high quality package of PMTCT services, daleiopedand seated-up in partnership with
host governments and other N60 partners.  is not involved in providing direct patient
care, but works with governmentsto enhance thescale-up of their PMTCT programmes, ﬁll
gaps in infrastructure, train and support technicai staﬂ’, improve the supply chain, and
develop appropriate interventions in ensue mother—infant foliow—up.

The CHAI PMT CT programmes will support the Millennium Deveiopment Goals (MDG) of
reducing maternal and chiid mortaiity. Each project expects to support the upgrade of
services offered at local heaith fadiib'a and forge strong linkages with the community to
achieve universal coverage of the targeted population - women ofchiid-bearing age (WCBA)
and children. The programmes aiso aim to increase the number of people across the
population who seek and receive HIV detection and treatment services.

a. Situation Assessment

Malawi is a geographically small, landlocked county in Southemlpentral Africa with a rapidly
increasing high density populatim, currertly estimated at 13.6 million. Malawr, ranked as
one ofthe world’s p00rest naticns,alsohasoneofthehighesti-llv AIDS prevalence rates.
As in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, infants born to sew—positive mothers account for the
majority of new HIV cases each year, accelerating the already dramatic Spread of HIV.

Without intervention, the majority ofdiesechildren will diein early infancy or by their

infection and/or have more at—risk pregnancies.

Malawi has twenty-eight geographical districts spread across vast rural distances and
communities are very poorly comer:th by extemely Md roads, many of which become
impassable in the rainy season. Each district: is led bya District Commissioner or Chief
Executive and health services are administered by a District Health Ofﬁcer (DHO).

In 1985, the ﬁrst case of HIV in Malawi was reported. In 1989, the Malawi Government
announced a ﬁve-year AIDS plan, but it w not until 1994 that the new Malawi government
more fully recognized the wide-spread impact of this disease and the urgent need for
intervention. However, by this point AIDS had already damaged Malawi’s social and
economic infrastruchne. This belated recognition of HIVIAIDS as a major health issue is
one of the reasons Malawi is now one of Africa's most afﬂicted countries. AIDS related
diseases are a leading cause of death among Malawians and the links between AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria make the pandmic an inoeas‘ngly signiﬁcant global threat.

In response to  high prevale'ice of HIV in the population and rising mortality, the MOH
developed sophisticated Anti Reboviral- Therapy (ARI)  and is successfully
executing a national ART scale-up plan.

By the end of 2007, the scale-up had resulted in over 147,000 people ever initiated on
treatment with over 100,000 (68.5%) known in be alive and on neannent. This exceeded
the MOH target of 110,000 ever initiated. However, with a target of 90,000 (82%) alive and

on treatment, the mortality rate has been considerably worse than expected. Women
account for over 89,000 (61%) of those ever initiated and children account for nearly 12,000
(8.1%)4.

To date, the National AIDS Commission (NAC) estimatesthat 43.4% of adults and 40.3% of
children in need are receiving ARTS. The MOH recognizes this impressive ART scale up in
Malawi must be accompanied by aggressive HIV prevention strategies, both for adults and
for children (e.g. PMTCT). Without successful prevention efforts, the country will have little
chance of containing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

With a Gross National Income (GNI) percapita of US$230, Malawi ranks number 201 out of
209 countria in the world, according-to World Bank ﬁgures“. As a result, the MOH functions
with very limited resources, signiﬁcandy reducingthe impact it can have on the AIDS
pandemic in Malawi, and contributing in continual widespread infection.

b. Government Response

In order to effectively reversethe progression of HIV/AIDS, pregnant women are the critical
population group for success and must'be targeted in orderto reach a large portion of the
general population. The GOM fuiiy recognizes it must reduce the high level of new
infections through vertical transmission by providing a high quality package of interventions
to pregnant women. Their emoiment in the PMTCT programme not only reduces the spread
of the disease, but provides an entry pointto register HIV positive women and children into
HIV/AIDS care and treatment programmes. Vindiout'this vital entry point it is impossible to
achieve the critically needed increase in HIV/AIDS detection and imminent. The chart below
illustrates the commitment of the MOH to Maternal andChild Health Services and the
impressive scale up of the national PMTCT programme The historical perspective of the

Most data sources indicate that anywhere from 80% to more than 90% of pregnant women
in Malawi attend ANC services at least once during their pregnancia“. However, a large
percentage of these women do not access the mill-amof ANC, L&D, and FP semces,
resulting in limited uptake of all components of PMT CT care and treatment. Most Health
Centres face signiﬁcant diﬁ‘icutty in fatty implementing the guidelines due to a severe
shortage of resources and health personnel. Thisunderscores the need for systems-
strengthening along with conceivath implementation assistance.

_ The WHO has a broad four-pronged approach to the prevention of vertical tiansmission:
1. Primary prevention of HIV infection.
2. Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV.
3. Prevention of HIV transmission from mothers living with HIV to their infants.
4. Care, treatment, and support for mothers living with HIV, their children, and families.

With this in mind, the GOM has expanded the smpe and stats of the PTMCT Programme,
declaring the three-fold vision of theprogr-amme to be:

1. Bring about an HIV free generation in Malawi

2. Reduce paediatric HIV infection

3. Improve the quality of life of parents living with HIV
The MOH has initiated a national 5-Year Scale-Up plan to drive achievement of this vision.
The Objectives of the MOH PMTCT Programme areasfoltows=

o Offer routine HIV testing and counselling to all pregnant women, partners, and
families, and to all family planning clients.
Increase access to family planning services for HIV—positive WCBA.
Provide comprehensive, high quality PMl’Cl' care, treatment, and support to
pregnant and lactating women and their families.

- Strengthen the Matemai & Child Healﬂi (MCI-i) service delivery system through
integrating PMTCT activities in MG! and community services.

c. Challenges to the National PMTCT Programme
The MOH has identiﬁed the foilowing drailengs to successful impleme'itation:

Programme implementation is often slow due to deiayed disbursements of funds.
Shortage of staff at all levels.

PMTCl' data management is not aligned with the Health Managanent Information
System (HMIS).

o Weak linkages between maternal and child health for PMTCT to facilitate the
continuum of care leading to limited follow-up of WW mothers and exposed infants.

o Vertical HIV programme planning, implementation, and management has allowed
rapid expansion of HIV and other programms buthas ted to missed opportunities to
fully integrate PMTCl’ into MCH and other relevant sen/tea.

- Poor community mobilization including weak linkages between facilities and the
community, low leveis of couple tesh'ng and counselling, and limited PMI’CT uptake
limit enhanced support for women, chitdren and family members living with HIV.

- Scaling up provision of more efﬁcacious ARV regimens for PMTCl'.

Additionally the MOH has identiﬁed thefollowing. barriers and bottlenecks:
- Frequent shack-outs of HIV test kits.

Timely disbursement of funds from the Global Fund and partners to effectively
implement the PMTCT programme at the district level.

Inadequate infrastructure.

Insufﬁcient and suboptimal staff housing makes retention of technical staff difﬁcult.
Lack of involvement of male partners in PMTCT.

Inadequate laboratory equipment, supplies and services to wpport clinical care.

After extensive discussions with the MOH PMTCT
with implementing partners, and a '
CHAI has determined that the following gaps or
the low PMTCT coverage in Malawi:

infection and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies among infected women.

(2) Human Resource Challenges: Critical Shortage of Technical Staff
at Health Facilities9

The lack of adequate numbers of technical staff in health facilities is a major human
resource crisis in Malawi as indicated in the table below.

The WHO recommends that the minimum stafﬁng for a health facility consists of two
clinicians (doctors, clinical ofﬁcers or medical assistants), .2 nurses/midwives, and at least 1
environmental health ofﬁcer or health mslant. However, in Malawi, only 6% of the 901
primary level facilities meet minimum staff norms (see Table 5 above).

Conditions are not favourable for health worker retention in government service. Among
those who left government service, 39% left because of low pay and 35% left because of
poor working conditions’.

Currently Malawi faces an extremely high vacancy rate for nursing positions throughout the
country, and rural areas face the 'severst difﬁculty in securing technical staff. The shortage
of lab technicians who are critical tn l-ﬂv diagnosis, care, and treatment, limits the country’s
ability to perform lab tests such as CD4 counts, haemogobin tests, and liver function
monitoring. At the end of 2007, the government sector employed only 208 lab technicians
for the whole county.

The MOH has undertaken extensive PM‘r'Cl'lraining but many workers either have not had
PMTCT training or require Lip—dated baiting in rrnewith the new PMTCT guidelins to equip
them with the skills in testing, oomselling and staging. Sincethe numbers of staff at most
facilities is already sub-minimal, when a staff member is absent (e.g., for training) no testing
or counselling can take place The encasive work—load on me existing technical staff causes
extreme fatigue. PMTCT scale-up success will result in more patimts in care and on
treatment which will, in turn, create an even greater burden or: the already over-worked
health personnel.

(3) Infrastructure & Transport Challenges

The vast majority of health facilities were construwd prior to the onset of the HIV/AIDS
pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the number of people accessing health care still
fails Substantially short of those who need it, the infrastruchire capacity is currently
“bursting at the seams” and is often low quality, inadequately maintained, poorly serviced,
and in some cases, not ﬁt for quality health care service delivery. Often, there simply is
insufﬁcient space to meet current patient needs. Conditions are further aracerbated at rural
health facilities that lack electric power or a safe supply of running water.

The MOH’s PMTCI' programme has the goal of increasing the uptake of pregnant women
accessing HCT and follow-up services. To support this scale—up of PMTCT services there is
an urgent need to supplement in innovative ways both'the space available and infrastructure
quality at health centres and PMTCT sites.

Difﬁculties in transport, induding lack of all types of vehicles for transport of patients and
supplies, create a major obstacle to quality health care service delivery. As Malawi has a
largely rural population and limited mournes, health service providers with inadequate
transport are unable to offer laboratory, diagnostic, emergency, outreach, and other

services. The population (partiuilarly pregnant women and small children) are often unable
to reach the health centres when most necessary.

Compounding this problem, severely inadequate and poorly or'non-maintained roads limit
access even when transport is available. Universal access to transport within the project
area is essential for the provision of high quality PMTCT services, including community-
based and follow-up services.

(6) Challenges Related to Integrated Service [Cascade Linkages

The challenges identiﬁed to this point cannot be addressed in isolation. The linkages among
solutions need to bring about integrated service delivery across the entire PMTCl' cascade.
There are barriers or challenges to achieving this integration including facilities design,
“silos” in different segments ofthe health system, and stress by patients to different parts
of the system. The current system  many patients to make multiple visits with
separate appointments in different: parts of the health system. Because of distance and lack
of transport, compliance is often impo$ible

(7) Challenges in Community-Based Care and Follow-Up

The progression of HIV/AIDS in the nation has caused unprecedented and unparalleled
pressures on the heaith care system of Malawi, stretching its resources far beyond what is
feasible. In addition, the disease has placed severe stresses on households in the
communities, and has adversely affected traditional systems once in place that were
designed to care for those in need. A comprehensive approach tothe prevenuon of MTCT

(8) Challenges in Monitoring & Evaluation (use)

The Malawi MOH has a decentralized, larmiy paper-based M&E system with separate
registers and reporting tools for differ-art components of care. In addition, health facilities
make up their own paper registries where centrally designed systems are absent. Relevant
tools in use in different parts of the health system include:

Patient master cards
Patient health passporls.
Registers for Ante Natal Clinics (ANC), Labour & Delivery Wards (L&D), Under-Five
Clinics (U5), Family Planning Clinics (PP), and the ART Programme.

- Anew MOHPMTCTRegisterhasbeendeveloped buthasnotyetbeen pn‘ntedand
distributed in all sites.

0 New MOH PMTCT Report (See Appendix 6)

In addition, the MOH and its technical working groups (TWGs) supply other useful reporls.
These include PMTCT reports, EID reports, the HRH census, ART quarterly and annual
reports and ART (MS Excel) database, NAC Sentinel Surveys, and others. The major
challenge is that all these are separate data sources and are not tied into a single reporting
system. Likewise, there are typically no linkages between patients who appear in one
register to the same patient who appears in another register.

Manual copying, data entry, and analysis will be required in provide an integrated view of
performance of the whole PMTCT programme.

d. CHAI's Work In Malawi* 

CHAI began ils programmatic work in Malawi in 2006 and currently its activities fall into
seven key areas:

1. Policy advice, support, and technical assistance to the Ministry of Health (MOH)

2. Procurement and distribution of ARV and diagnostic: for paediatric care as
well as for Adult 2nd line therapy.

3. Paediatric nutrition services for the MOH’s Out-Patient Therapy Programme (OTP) 2
to treat children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) through Community—based 
Therapeutic Care (CTC) ’ i

4. Laboratory Services Programme to train Lab Assistants and to build, refurbish,
equip, supply and provide technical support for laboratories.

5. Paediatric programme development and supportof paediatric HIV/AIDS outreach
and services, technical assistance with paediatric clinical trials, and support for the _
MOH’s ART programme M&E.

6. Rural delivery of quality integrated health care senrios in partiership with
Partners In Health (PIH) in the Neno District.

7. PMTCI' policy and programme development and support including Early Infant
Diagnosis (EID).

CHAI has been engaged with the MOH to inﬂuence and help Write PMTCT policy and -.
guidelines. With the proposal that follows in Section III, CHAI is preparing to I 
engage in more intensive support. As partof the MOH's PMTCT programme, this ;
intervention seeks to demonstrate the ability to scale up high quality, effective, and

comprehensive delivery of PMTCT services in one or more focused districts, thereby

achieving a dramatic reduction of mother-to—child transmission of HIV despite

Malawi’s resource-limitations.

III. CHAI PROPOSED SOLUTONS

1. INTRODUCTION

CHAI will support the MOH in addressing the most fundamental elements of an effective
PMTCT service delivery system:

c The needtoreachandtestallpregnantwomen.
- The need in apand high quality services”.
c The need to keep all sew-positive mother-infant pairs in the continuum of care.

The implementatim plan will be guided as follows:

1. CHAI will operate within the guidelines of the MOI-E’s PMTCT Programme, and with
. the approval of the national and local PMTCT leadership. CHAI will work to provide
supplementary interventions in the focal area in order to assist the MOH to offer and
effectively deliver a fully oomprehaislve and high quality package of PMTCT services.

2. CHAI will support the Ministryof Health in delivering high—quality PMTCT services at
scale with increased retention. This will also support expanded HIV/AIDS testing,
treatment, and care in the focused districtto ensure delivery of the full continuum of
quality health care for women, children and men with HIV/AIDS.

Implementation of CHAI’s proposed solutions will follow a phased approach to assist scale
up in order to dramatically reduce MTCT. The phases, while conceptually sequential, will
overlap in the‘r implementation.

The ﬁnal phase is intended to drive sustainability of the PMTCT strategy and plan by
working with the MOH to document and distribute lessons learned. These will support
ongoing strategy development, planning, and management and will incorporate key
elements of the strategy into the county's national PMTCT plan. Support for PMTCT will be
institutionalized in the government system and ultimately reﬂected in the national PMTCT
budget.

The activities and interventions detailed in this proposal were developed in consultation with
the MOH Coordinator and Technical Assistant of the national PM'l’Cl' Programme, and also in
consultation with the DHO and the PMTCT Coordinator at the District Level. Once approved,
the project will become operational with the buy-in, approval, and support of the DHO, the
District Nursing Ofﬁcer (DNO) and the District PMTCT Coordinator (DPC) for the selected
dislrict(s). Concurrently, CHAI will maintain  toward local communities and health
committees to ensure their concerns are addressed by the programme. A critical element of
the strategy to promote local ownership of this effort will be the involvement of all health

workers through a whole site training approach to help ensure eventual sustainability of the
interventions.

CHAI believes that a key element of a successﬁil programme is setting ambitious yet
attainable targets. The primary thrust of CHAI‘ Malawi’s PMTCT support initiative is to
demonstrate the feasibility of effective and comprehensive delivery and increased and
sustained up-take of the full range of PMTCT services in this resource limited setting,
thereby attaining a dramatic reduction of'moﬂier-to—child transmission of HIV.

2. VISION -& MISSION FOR THE PMTCT PROGRAMME

 

CHAI’s VISION is to help  Maiawi drive toward

aduevementofan  through-a dramatic decrease
in paediatric HIV 

CHAI’s MISSIQ is to support ﬂue-comprdlendve and effech've
implementation of all elements of the ﬁnish-y of Health's PMTCT
programme in a selectecyhigh ptevalenoe. area.

4. SELECTION OF TARGET DISTRICT --MACHINGA

Malawi is made up of 28 districts, all facing signiﬁcant challenges in scaling-up the national
PMT CT programme. The MOH directed CHAI to select a focal distn‘ct not currentiy served by
other partners. CHAI Malan oondrned intensiveand eiaensive site assessments rn four of
these districts. It was readily apparent that all districts face similar challenges, and all

could beneﬁt from support. HIV prevalence levels vary signiﬁcantly by region with the
Southern Region having signiﬁcantly higher population and HIV prevalence. The Central
Region is more moderate, and the Northern Region has both signiﬁcantiy lower population
and HIV prevalence levels.

Consequently CHAI Malawi is proposing that the focal district for the PMTCT initiative be
Machinga in the southern region. Machinga District has the third highest HN prevalence
rate in Malawi, at over 22%“. There are four ART sites in the rﬁstricl: (Machinga DH, Ntaja,
Chikweo, and Namandanje), which might not be sufﬁcient forthe population served. Other
key factors make it an important but challenging target.

- The primary language spoken (Uriyao) is not the national language, although
Chichewa is also understood.

- The entire disﬁct borders Mozambique on the eastern side and a signiﬁcant number
of people from Mozambique obtain services at Machinga health facilities.

- Common Cultural Practiosz Early marriage for gins (child brides), polygamy, girls’
initiation into sex; women are often “second dass” members of society

o A large section of Machinga District surrounds Lake Chﬂwa and its ﬁshing district.

- Many patients oorne from neighbouring Mangochi District; also a lake district.

o A large percentage of the men in thisdistrict fali into two working categones that
both have signiﬁcantly higher HIV prevalence rates in Malawi. Namely, business
men who travel frequentiy and far extended periods; and ﬁshermen.

o The District Hospital is not geographically cenhai in the district (it is in the extreme

west), causing additional diﬂimlty for the transportation inﬁ'astructure.

Other than the District Hospital, ail health facilities in the district are mral.

Low percentage of deliveries in health facilities.

Health centres are not cunently previding CPT to any HIV+ pregnant women.

CD4 counts are tun-envy only available at the District Hospital.

ART: Only 1.2% of patients ever initiated on ART through PMTCT13

stVP is currently the only HIV prophylaxis used.

EID is not yet available in the district.

Using this data, CHAI has determined the potentiai impact of a successful increase in uptake
of high quality PMTCl’ interventions in the Madiinga Disbict. If resources for PMTCl'
services continue to be severely limited, as at present, 3000 - 4,500 infants will be infected
overthe nextthreeyears. Ofnote ismefactthatin 2007,thePMTCl' programme in

6. PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT

At all times we will keep in mind the two overarching goals of the MOH PMTCT programme
in section III “CHAI Proposed Solutions", Sub-Section 3, “Goals” and their associated
measuremenl: as repeated below.

1. Dramatically increase the percentageofpregmt women accessing the full
range of PMTCT servics

2. Signiﬁany decrease the mu: «vertical transmission

Measuring performance will also require simullaneously loose and tight controls. By this, we
mean we will strive to maintain tight and precise contol at a high level ofa very small
number of key, measurable results, but only looseountroi over secondary variables that will
not materially aﬁ‘ect the ultimate outcome and therefore are less important or meaningful.

Managing CHAI’s support of the Ministry's PMTCT Programme requirs using MOH reporting
data to help monitor the key indicators of success. These indicators fall into three
categories:

The indicators that follow are aligned with the eight strategic actions described previously.
Not all activitia and results can be measured quantitatively. Therefore, qualitative
measurements are also included.

a. Key Indicators of Success

Note: In the MOH PMTCT programme, several registers are used ﬁor M&E. These include
registers for Ante Natal Clinics (ANC), Labour & Deiivery Wards (L&D), Under-Five Clinics
(U5), Family Planning Clinics (FF), and the ART Programme In addition, the MOH and its 
technical working groups (TWGs) supply other useful reports. These include PMTCT reports, ‘
EID reporis, the HRH census, ART quarterly and annual reports and database, NAC Sentinel

Surveys, and others. Ali will be cited below as “MOH.”

b. Risk Assessment

There are many potential risks associated with the proposed interventions. CHAI will work
closely with GOM, MOH, District leadership and partners to minimize these risks.

 

 

 

Table 19: Risk Assessment
RISK ASSESSMENT _
_ Risks I  I ’ ' imitationstqilr’ingate'kis‘k'
1. Community sensitisab'on and male involvement Sustained and repetitive community
efforts may be insufﬁcient to counter centuries awareness campaigns

old traditions

Sustained efforts to obtain the assistance and
positive inﬂuence of local and leaders
Targeted interventions to provide incentives
for male involvement

 

2. Proposed infrastructure enhancements will be
insufﬁcient to deliver quality VPMTCr services

Utilize innovative and creative methods to fully
utilize available space

 

3. Interim stafﬁng efforts will be limited by
prospects for sustainability

Work with MOH and District Leadership to
optimize stafﬁng on a District wide basis for

 

interventions to enhancestafﬁng in PM'l'Cl'
services may be insufﬁcient to meet demand

provision of PMTCT services
Supplement and raise skill levels of existing
staff through effective menton'LcL
4. Given the existing environment with a critical Employ expert task shifting to optimize patient
national shortage of human resources, loads with ﬁmited resources

Utilize available expertise to raise skill levels of
all existing staff — technical and HSAs - to
create more efﬁcient patient ﬂow and less
time for start-patient interaction, while
offering the same quality of services
Incorporate technical devices for patient
education removing this burden from staff

 

5. Succasin inc-easing up-take of’PMTCT services
may overwhelm the system

Adopt a phased approad'r so that
infrastructure and other enhancements stay
ahead of increased Lip-take of services

 

6. CHAI support for the MOH PMTCT programme
will be partially dependent on successful delivey
of results by care partners

CHAI will maintain close interactions with care
partners and ensure that goals and
expectations are clearly communicated

 

7. MOH will be unable to sustain proposed
enhancements in infrastructure, stafﬁng and
resources

CHAI‘s intention is exit support in the focal
district(s) with enough infrastructure
enhancements in place to allow for
maintenance of the services. Every effort will
be made to increase up-take of services with
creative and sustainable human resource
interventions outiined above.

 

8. Despite demonstrating success in targeted areas
the MOH will lack the resources to effectively
scale up on a national level the full breadth and
scope of the services offered

 

 

Work with MOH to access additional ﬁrnding
(e.g. GFATM, PEPFAR) to sustain these efforts
beyond the time constraints of this iniﬁative
and to ensure trained leadership and
implementation staff are in place.

c. Monitoring and Evaluatron' (M&E)

The MOH is highly committed to an effective and comprehensive M&E process and reporting
system. The Ministry emphasizes that its goal for high quality M&E is to give PMTCT staff
effective tools to assist them in providing quality services and effective patient follow up,
rather than only serving central reporting needs. To achieve this, the MOH has established
clearly prescribed M&E and data requirements including data recording, collection, analysrs,
and reporting procedures.

CHAI will work with the MOH in the targeted area to. ban ensurethat data and M&E as
outlined by the national PMTCI' programme, is as comprehensive and accurate as possible.
CHAI will assist in enhancing the effective use of all M&E materials mandated by the MOH.
CHAI understands it does not have a mandate to go beyond the MOH’s well-deﬁned M&E
requirements or to impose an unnecessary burden on the system, personnel, or partners.
Any suggestions for M&E improvement will be passed on to the MOH for their consideration,
but CHAI will not independently introduce any additional data collection or M&E
requirements.

The Ministry of Health has deﬁned Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) as follows:

. Monitoring is a regular, routine, systematic collection and analysis of information
monthly, quarteriy and annually to track the progress of programme implementation
with the speciﬁc aim of improving sevice delivery.

- Evaluation is the systematic examination andlcr analysis of past decisions in order to
assess value, worth or impact, and to learn from them and improve. Evaluation takes
an objective lookattheaclivitiesperfonnedand identiﬁesthe reasonsfor both
success and faﬂure, and how your future work can learn from both. It is normally not
routine, but carried out at speciﬁed periods.

Monitoring and evaluation helps programme implernenters and service providers to:

Monitor the progress of programme implementation

Build on strengths in the implantation process

Identify areas requiring strengthening and take actions to rectify problems

Mobilize and utilize resources to implement programme activities, including
monitoring consumption of these resoixces

Evaluate the adrent to which the programme is having or has had the desired impact
Assist the MOH to mobilize resoumfrom treasury and from cooperating partners

The MOH recognizes the importance of maintaining complete records of patients in all
components of the PMTCI' cascade including records from adolscent youth friendly health
servrces. To do so, the MOH provides periodic supervision to ensure quality M&E. They
further require and recognize:

o Accurate recording of infannation in registrars, master cards, and health passpons
results in timely, accurate and complete information that can be analyzed to
generate a report on utilization of services by the target population.

a Record keeping and reponing of routine programme monitoring is useful to service
provrders at the facrlrty and program managers at district, zonal and national levels
for planning, management and resource  and allocation to health
programmes.

- Key PMTCT indicators for monitoring progress and quality of service deliv are
integrated into health passports and MCH registers and other compleme'igfly
registers sudi as HTC, family plaming, and STE.

The National PMTCT Programme mandates the use of the following registers:

HTC Register 0 Postwatal Care and Follow-up Register
- Antenatal Care Register 0 Under-ﬁve Register
- Matemlty Register - ARTRegister

The National PMTCT Programme requires the following data collection during delivery of
PMTCT services:

- HIV information is recorded in Women, :Oiild and Men Health Passports for every
patient who accesses services

- HIV information and other data is. recorded in ANC, Maternal Services,
Family Planning and Postnatal Services
Registers are summarized at the end of each waking day
These summaries are used for efﬁcient'care and follow up

use of funds.
e. Establishing Pathway to Sustainabitity

SuStainability of this project will be a high priority through all levels of implenentation. To
ensure we establish and follow a pathway to sustainability, the following will be key:

- The MOH fully understands that CHAI'S initiative to wpport the national PMTCT
programme is limited to three years and other sources of funding will be needed for
continuation and expansion.

- CHAI will ensure that all activities wﬂi only be implemented with ongoing concurrence
of the MOH, the DHO, the PMTCT Coordinator, the IEC and HMIS Ofﬁcers of the
District served.

- Throughout the operational stages of the programme CHAI will collaborate with in
consultation with the above personnel to implement activities that can continue to be
managed when the project terminates.

- CHAI will avoid hiring personnel who cannot be sustained by the MOH.

- CHAI will ensure that: the truerventions involving community mobilisation and basic

infrastructure are effective enough to have tong term impact, far beyond the
duration of the project.

- CHAI will ensure that systems induding M85, patient ﬂow and staff capabilities to

initiate ARV prophyiaids are ﬁrmiy in place, and capable of duration beyond CHAI and
partners’ involvement

7. FUNDING REQUEST & BUDGET

To support this initiative, CHAI requests funding from the  of  Kingdom of
Nomay for comprehensive PMTCT support in the selected district of Machinga. The 
is approximately $645 for each of 8,613 HIV+ mother—infant pairs in care, or $5.56 million
over three years (36 months) from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011.

Second District

If additional funds are available, CHAI proposes a'subsequent phase of this proposal to
support successful implementaﬁon of the MOH PMTCT programme in a second district. This
phase would commence in the second year. Additional funds would be proportionate to the

number of mother-infant pairs or pregnancies iii-the  Overhead oosls would not
increase as a result of adding the second district.

Appendix 12: CHAI WORK IN MALAWI

INTRODUCTION:

- The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (Cl-1A1) me into Malawi in 2006 as part
of the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative (CHDI) with a mandate to drive rural
growth and business development in three districts designated by the Government of
Malawi. At the time, HIV/AIDS initiatives were pursued under direction of the
combined CHDI organization. Prior to this time, from 2004, Malawi was a beneﬁciary
of CHAI's global work to reduce the cost of ARVs- for developing countries.

- People living in rural areas otter: ladtacce$ to basic health care. CHAI and its sister
organization in Malawi, me Clinton—Hunter Development Initiative (CHDI), have
teamed with Dr. Paul Farmer and his organization, Partners in Health (PIH), in a rural
health initiative to provide HIV/AIDS (are and comprehensive health care to people
living in the Neno District.

o CHAI, CHDI, and PIH are working with the Government of Malawi to address the
complex nads involved in provitﬁng care in areas that lack even basic infrastructure.
This work includes: training health care workers; recruiting and training 84 new lab
assistants; enhancing lab infrastructure; providing test equipment, reagents, and
sample transportation; improving the physical capacity of health care facilities
including a new District Hospital in Neno; building health worker housing; providing
sanitation and water; and focusing on integrated rural development and growth,
education enhancenent, and more G-lAI is also leading programmatic efforts in
treatment for severe acute malnutrition in Neno, has conducth all training in the
MOH CTC programme including for PIH dinicians, and continues to provide
supervision and RUTF for patient treatment.

CHAI began its programmatic work in Malawi in 2006 and currently its activitis fall into
seven key areas:

1. Policy advice, support, andtechnical assistance in the Ministry of Health (MOH)

2. Procurement and  of ARV anddiagnostics for paediatric care as
well as for Adult 2nd line therapy.

3. Paediatric nutrition services for the WDH'S Out—Patient Therapy Programme (OTP)
to treat children with Severe Acute Malnubitim (SAM) through Community-based
Therapeutic Care (CTC). Ci-lAI has had actensive involvement in scaling up
Community-based The-apeub‘c Care (CT C) providing training and RUTF for the MOH’s
Outpatient Therapy Program (OTP) program.

4. Laboratory Services Prognmmeto train Lab Assistants and to build, refurbish,
equip, supply and provide technical support for Iaboratories.

5. Paediatric programme  and support of paediatric HIV/AIDS outreach
and servroes, technical assrslance with paediatric clinical bials, and support for the
MOH’s ART programme M&E.

6. Rural delivery of quality Weed health care services in partnership with
Partners In Health (PIH) in the Neno District.

7. P_MTCT policy and programme development and support including Early Infant
Diagnosis (ED).

APPENDIX 12: CHAI WORK IN MALAWI PAGE 2
SPECIFIC PROGRAM ACTIVITIES & RESULTS

WW
- CHAI Malawi helps train health workers in Community Therapeutic Care (CI‘C) that
focuses on ﬁnding children with Severe Acute Malnubition (SAM). Funded by external
partners, CHAI also donates the Ready-m-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) essential for
treatment to care facilities throughout Malawi.
- The programme is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality among children, especially
those with HIV/AIDS
- CT C Program Support
0 3 Districts served direcﬂy by CHAI (Chiﬁpa, Mwanza, and Neno)
0 Health Workers trained
- 636 Health Care Workers trained June - Dec 2007 by CHAI in Community
Therapeutic Care (CHAI’s involvement in Cl'C started in May 2007) for the
MOH's Outpatient Thempy Program (DTP) for Severe Acute Malnutrition
(SAM) using RUTF.
- Another 178 trained in Jan and Feb 2008.
- RUTF Procurement & Treatment
0 17 Districts supplied by O-iAI (4 by Concern Wondwide); 6 Districts unserved.
o 135 metric tons of RUTF purchased since the start of the program
0 Over 10,000 children suffering from SAM have been treated using RUTF from
CHAI
- Supplier support — operations assesenent'tn reduce cost ofRUTF, all of which is
purchased from Malawi suppliers
- Challenges
0 Sustainability - Working with Disbict Health Ofﬁcers to have them incorporate a
portion of RUTF costs in their District Implementation Plans (DIPs 0r budgets).
This is a signiﬁcant challenge, short—term.
o Needfora stmngeﬂinkageand betterM&Etoshowthe mutual linkage between
nutrition and HIV/AIDS ART scale—up.

LAB ASSIST ANTS TRAINING

- Cuniculum development. With CHAI's support, the curriculum has been developed
for training Lab Assistants and approved for deployment at Malawi College of Health
Sciences (MCHS)

- Equipment and supplies for MCHS and District Hospitals in Neno and Mwanza have
been provided by CHAI

(A) LAB ASSIST ANTS TRAINING Him

0 84 successful applicants (82 positions ﬁlled) admitted to the Lab Assistant
Training Program at MCHS in Dec 2007 (funded and directiy supported by CHAI
(tuition, room & board; stipend).

o CHAI's inﬂuence in the paediatric area has involved increasing awareness and
importance of paediatric care, helping initiate an EED pilot, and promoting infant FDCs.
The impact of these efforts will felt overt-he long term.

- Fixed Dose Combination Paediatric ARVs (FDCs)

o No FDCs in MOH ART Guidelines. Limited use in Malawi
0 CHAI's efforts multed in a change in the 2008 ART Guidelines to include
paediatric FDCs with an emphasis on formulations for children weighing <10KG.

The guidelns are expected to be printed and disbibuted in May or June 2008
o This should have impor'ant quarlty of care impacts.

0 Training will need to take place in the future for changed ART options. Impact
likely to be limited in 2008

- Disaggregated Outcomes Reporting Initiative
0 Just approved following a lengthy review by MOH, NAC, and GOM ethics
committee, CHAI has launched a “Disaggregated Outcomes Assessment Project”
that is taking place from April-Aug 2008 using digitai imaging, data entry, and
analysis. This will establish a 2007 baseline and identify sentinel sites for annual

assessment that will provide more detail in future and should result in improved
measurement of outcoms of Malawi’s ART programme.

0 For the ﬁrst time since inception of Malawi’s ART effort, the MOH will know

have a backup record of all data from every ART site in the country resulting in a
signiﬁcant improvemmt in data security and availability.

Appendix 14: CARE PARTNERS

At the request of the MOH CHAI has targeted for this project a focal area that is currently
almost without direct NGO presence. In order to scale up the national PMT CT programme
the GOM works closely with all implementing partners including CHAI. CHAI, together with
other care partners, has been actively 'mvoived in the PMTCT and Paediatric HIV Sub-Group
Committee, as well as the Technical Working Group. All of these partners played key roles
in assisting the MOH in developing and ﬁnalizing the 2008 PMTCT Guidelines. Since PMi'CT
sen/ices in one district cannot be isolated from the servims provided nationally CHAI will
collaborate, on various levels, with several ofthe following partners:
