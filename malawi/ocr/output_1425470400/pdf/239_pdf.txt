Project Summary

Project Overview: The Trunk Road Rehabilitation Project: Blantyre-Zomba road is part of
the N orth—South spine linking the southern part of Malawi to the central and northern regions
and further on to Tanzania. The 60 km road is an important link on Route 29 of the SADC
Regional Trunk Road Network (RTRN). The project is to be implemented over a five—year
period for a total financial requirement of UA26.713 million, comprising UA25.53 million
for the Blantyre-Zomba road and UA1.183 million for the feasibility and detailed engineering
design of the Ntcheu—Tsangano—Neno—Mwanza road.

Beneﬁciary Participation: The project outputs will directly benefit the people of the three
districts of Blantyre, Chiradzulu and Zomba including residents of the two cities. The
majority of road users are commuters travelling between the two cities for work, trading,
agricultural activities and those seeking social services such as education and medical
services. Administrators and social workers will also make use of the road to provide
extension and outreach services.

Notable impacts on the beneficiaries will include increased economic activities due to
improved transport services with reductions in the cost of transport, travel time and improved
road safety and ultimately improve the living standards of the communities in the zone of
inﬂuence. There will be additional benefits from the project through acquisition of jobs
during construction and obtaining sub-contracts for supply of goods and services. The
communities along the road will also benefit from HIV/AIDS/STI and road safety awareness
and campaigns.

Project Rationale and Need: The project will contribute to the reduction of poverty by
enhancing economic activities in the area and hence achieve the objectives of the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) which is in line with Bank Group Country Strategy
Paper under Pillar I. The intervention has been identified by Government as first on the list of
priority roads for rehabilitation in the Road Sector Programme (RSP 2007-2011). The project
has a high economic rate of return and is environmentally sound and socially desirable.

Bank’s Value Added: Bank has considerable experience in the road sector in the region
including Malawi. The project has benefited from this experience in reviewing and
interpreting the scope of works and detailed engineering design documents; and ensuring
execution will be in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner. The Bank will bring,
throughout the project cycle, engineering, environmental and economic expertise and
experience to realize the objectives ad benefits of the project.

Knowledge Management: The in—situ recycling strategy adopted for rehabilitation of the
Blantyre—Zomba Road will contribute to knowledge generation on new techniques of best
international practice in rehabilitation technology. The project will also support generation of
knowledge through the capacity strengthening component.

TRUNK ROAD REHABILITATION BLANTYRE-ZOMBA ROAD PROJECT

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ADB
GROUP TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
MALAWI

Management submits the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan for
UA22.98 million to finance the Trunk Road Rehabilitation: Blantyre—Zomba Road and a
proposed grant for UA1.124 million to finance the Feasibility and Detailed Engineering
Design of the Ntcheu—Tsangano—Neno—Mwanza Road in Malawi.

I — STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives

The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS—2006-2011), the
country’s second generation poverty reduction strategy, identifies infrastructure
development and rehabilitation as one of the five themes for poverty reduction. The
strategy further identifies transport infrastructure development as one of the six key
priority—focus areas on which quick progress must be made to accelerate the attainment of
the MGDS objectives. The Results Based Country Strategy Paper Mid—Term Review
(RBCSP 2005 -2009) dialogue with Government reinforced this emphasis by highlighting
the need for future Bank intervention to focus on transport infrastructure to enhance
competitiveness and the servicing of other sectors such as agriculture, health and
education and is consistent with Pillar I of the Country Strategy Paper which puts
emphasis on internal and regional transport networks.

1.2 Rationale for Bank’s involvement

1.2.1 The Bank’s intervention is consistent with the country’s aspirations to improve the
transportation services. The Blantyre—Zomba road is part of Route 29 of the SADC Regional
Trunk Road Network (RTRN) linking southern Malawi to the northern part of the country
and further north to the border with Tanzania. As such the road has been identified by
GOM as first on the priority list of roads for rehabilitation intervention under the Road
Sector Programme (RSP 2007-2011) to improve the quality of transport services for easy
access. The Ntcheu—Tsangano—Neno—Mwanza road is to serve the south—westem part of the
country renown for its agricultural potential. The feasibility study will determine the most
economic option of upgrading the road for taking further to detailed engineering design and
preparation of bidding documents.

1.2.2 The Bank Group has extensive experience in implementing transport projects in
Malawi. The Bank has completed 18 operations, which have provided lessons used during
project design of this proposed intervention.

Comments on Donor coordination:

There is good co—ordination of activities of donors in the country in the transport sector
through a Transport Donor Coordination Group (TDCG) that provides a platform on
which the development partners discuss financing and implementation issues in the
sector. The group is currently led by the EU. Government has also set up a Consultative
Transport Forum with participation of Government stakeholders and donors to ensure
Government—led donor co—ordination.

2.2 Technical Solution Retained and Other Alternatives Explored

2.2.1 A number of alternatives were considered to select the most cost effective
solution based on best rehabilitation option, design life, traffic demand, costs and benefits
to the road users and the public at large. A DBST surfacing on 200mm crushed stone base
on 150mm recycled and stabilized existing pavement layers was retained as the most
technically feasible and economically viable solution.

Table 2.2: Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection

Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection
Asphalt Concrete 40 mm asphalt concrete surfacing I Not economically viable
(AC) on 200mm crushed stone base on
in-situ recycled, stabilized existing
layers.
Asphalt Concrete 40 mm asphalt concrete surfacing I Unsuitable for traffic loading over
(AC) on 100mm crushed stone base on design life
in-situ recycled, stabilized existing I
layers. I
Patch and Seal Patch existing surfacing and I Not technically sound
overlay with asphalt concrete layer I

The strategy of in—situ recycling of the existing pavement layers is the latest innovative
technology in road rehabilitation that minimizes exploitation of new material sources.
The normal specifications in road construction will be used to minimize risk of pre—
mature failure.

2.3 Project Type

The project is a stand—alone operation supporting the RSP that puts emphasis on the
development and improvement of road infrastructure to open up the rural areas for easy
access to inputs and markets, access to health, education and other social facilities and

services, at reduced cost of transport. The modality of intervention is preferred due the
special expertise required for the civil works contract for the most economic and
technically feasible rehabilitation strategy. Initiatives of basket financing in the roads
sub—sector (SWAp) spearheaded by the EU are being explored by the Transport Donor
Coordination Group (TDCG) of Which the Bank is part.

2.5 Project’s Target Area and Population

The Project road traverses three districts of Blantyre, Chiradzulu and Zomba. The
project road is approximately 60 km beginning in Blantyre City and ending in Zomba
City. The beneficiaries of the project include dwellers of the three districts, communities
along the road, business operators, traders and commuters. Outcomes include increased
economic activities due to improved transport services with reductions in the cost of
transport, travel time and improved road safety and ultimately improve the living
standards of the communities.

2.6 Participatory Process for Project Identification, Design and Implementation

The identification process was embedded in the national consultation processes
during preparation of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (2006—201 1) which
prioritised transport infrastructure. Project design has benefited from inputs and feedback
collected from key informant interviews, group discussions, observations and public
meetings in which a wide range of beneficiaries and key stakeholders including district
and city assemblies, civil society and NGOs; and development partners active in the
roads sub—sector.

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reﬂected in project design

Bank experience in the road sector has identified that (i) to avoid modification of
the scope of works during project execution the detailed engineering design documents
require critical review by the Bank and Executing Agencies during project processing;
(ii) high turn—over of staff in the Executing Agencies results in non—adherence to the
implementation schedule agreed to at appraisal; (iii) lack of familiarity by the Executing
Agencies to the Bank Procurement and Disbursement Procedures results in
implementation delays. The lessons have been taken into account during project design
through review of the documentation prior to the preparation of the project and advising
the Executing Agency on Bank requirements prior to project appraisal. As far as capacity
is concerned, the Roads Authority being an autonomous entity has experienced
improvement in the retention of qualified and experienced technical staff which has
improved its management capacity of road projects. The RA therefore has a stable
compliment of staff because it offers attractive remuneration and conditions of service. To
minimize delays in procurement and disbursements, the Field Office in Lilongwe will
provide and follow—up on required activities by the Executing Agency.

2.8 Key performance indicators

Six outcomes and outputs have been identified to be monitored in the Results—
Based Logical Framework. The output indicators will be measured during project
implementation as sections of the road are opened to traffic and after project completion.
The identified outcomes, include improvement of transport services, enhanced economic
activity, improved living standards, reduction in cost of transport, reduced vehicle
operating costs and travel time and improved road safety. The supervision consultant will
be responsible for the collection of baseline data at various intervals throughout the
project as means of ensuring that the intended targets are achieved. Implementation
progress will be triggered by ensuring timely appointment of consultant, awarding civil
works contracts; and timely compensation and resettlement. Main source of data will be
progress reports and supervision reports.

III — PROJECT FEASIBILITY

3.1 Economic and financial performance

The methodology for the economic analysis is based on cost benefit analysis by
comparing the “with” and “without “ project scenarios over a period of 15 years, using
the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM—4). A discount rate of 12%, a
residual value of 15% and rehabilitation period of 2 years starting January 2011 are
adopted. The economic costs consist of (i) the capital investment costs and (ii) the routine
and periodic maintenance expenses. The benefits consist of savings in (i) vehicle
operating costs; (ii) motorized traffic travel time for passenger and cargo; and (iii) non
motorized transport traffic travel and operation. The traffic and economic analysis results
are presented in Annex (B7). The summary of the economic analysis is presented in
Table 3.1.

3.2 Environmental and Social impacts

Environment

3.2.1 The road project has been classified as Category 1 in accordance with ESAP. The
ESIA Summary and RAP have been posted on the Bank website prepared in January 2009.
Major adverse impacts of the project are biological and physical disturbance to
vegetation, discharge of pollutants, dust, fumes and waste. Social impacts will include
disturbance to about 56 households, loss of agricultural land and crops, induced spread of
HIV/AIDS/STI.

3.2.2 Mitigation measures include use of standard equipment, appropriate environmental
designs, use of water to control dust, good catchment management to curb sedimentation
and inclusion of specific environmental clauses in the contract. Positive outcomes include
control of communicable diseases, implementation of road safety awareness and
campaigns and afforestation. The cost for enhancement are UA47,000 for road safety and
UA253,000 for ESMP implementation.

Climate Change

3.2.3 The road project would contribute, though to a small extent, towards global
climate change. During construction machines and equipment will emit C02 and so will the
case be during operation where an increase in the volume of traffic would increase the
emission to the atmosphere. The improved road will reduce traffic congestion and ease
traffic flow which will reduce gas emissions. Mitigation and adaptation measures include
tree planting along the road vicinity with community participation since vegetation cover
serves as C02 sinks. In addition, there will be control against over clearing of vegetation.
There will also be control over type and condition of machines and equipment that emit
fumes. Furthermore, Government will have to consider laws and regulations to control the
purchase of over—aged vehicles. Motorists would have to be educated and sensitized on
limiting vehicle idling and maintain vehicle fitness, over—speeding and vehicle fitness.
There will be need for strict monitoring and inspection of contractor’s plant and equipment.

Gender

3.2.4 While men and women will both be affected by the project, women will bear a
disproportionate burden. The expected negative impacts on women include dislocation,
loss of property and land, and increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Mitigation measures
have been developed and budgeted for in the ESMP. These measures will be further
supported by the inclusion of CBOs as independent monitors. The expected positive
impacts on women include additional employment opportunities (temporary and
permanent), reduced travel time, diminished transport costs, and increased access to
health and educational facilities for women and girls. The project integrates an economic
empowerment component, allowing for women business groups to strengthen their
financial and technical capacity as suppliers for potential construction works.

Social

3.2.5 The road project will contribute towards poverty reduction both during
construction and operation phase. Approximately 130 people will get direct employment
during implementation. In addition, employment will be created through sub—contractors
and suppliers linked to the project. The sub—sectors which employ an estimated 62% of
the work force (both in formal and informal sectors) will receive a boost from the road
project including: services, manufacturing and agro—based industries such as dairy
farming, poultry, horticulture, etc. The road will facilitate commuters traveling between
Blantyre and Zomba including those seeking employment and students.

3.2.6 During operations, positive impacts will include increased economic activities
which will increase income earning opportunities. There will be reduced time of travel
and cost hence improving access to markets for inputs, raw materials and products. There
are a few large commercial estates growing tobacco, tea and coffee, which will benefit
from the road. The road will ease access to social services such post primary education,
referral hospitals, etc. Negative impacts could also arise from the rehabilitated road.
Over—speeding on the improved road may result in an increase in road accidents. The
spread of HIV/AIDS may get worse among construction workers as they mix with local
communities and long distance truck drivers. Malaria may also be an issue especially if
campsite accommodation is not well protected.

Involuntary Resettlement

3.2.7 The project will affect approximately 56 households out of which 38 will require
to be resettled. The type of assets affected include residential and business structures,
crops, plants, and trees several commercial dairy farms will also be affected. Public
infrastructure such as walls and fences will be affected alongside public utilities
(telephone and power lines and water pipes). An abbreviated resettlement action plan
(ARAP) has been prepared taking into consideration that the number of households
requiring resettlement is below the minimum threshold. The resettlement and
compensation costs are estimated at UAO.253 million a provision of which has been
provided for in the project total cost.

IV — IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 Implementation Arrangements
Institutional

4.1.1 The civil works will be implemented in a single contract over a 24 months
contract period. The feasibility and detailed engineering studies will be conducted over a
15 month period which will include training sessions targeting the public and private
sectors to build capacity and expertise in undertaking environmental and social impact
assessments. The Roads Authority (RA) will be responsible for the execution of the civil
works and supervision of the studies. The RA is a legally autonomous agency responsible
for overall planning, construction, maintenance, and management of the country's core road
network. The RA has successfully supervised similar road projects funded by donors
including the Bank and has sufficient experience and capacity for the execution of the
proposed project. The RA through the Directorate of Construction will assign a civil
engineer to be the project coordinator with a minimum of five years of experience and
qualifications that are acceptable to the Bank. This is a condition of the loan. He/She will
be responsible for overall monitoring of the activities of the project, and serve as a
contact person for all the parties involved in the project. He/She will liaise with the
consultant, prepare and forward the quarterly progress reports to the Bank and liaise with
the Bank during the preparation of the Project Completion Report. He will in addition
collaborate with the RA Environmental Officer to monitor the environment and social
management plan.

4.1.2 The contractor will be responsible for implementing ESMP measures while
resettlement and compensation will be the responsibility of RA in coordination with the
District and City Assemblies. Limited capacity exists to follow up and assist the
vulnerable to resettle. Involvement of CBOs and NGOs would be important. The road
safety component will be implemented through a service provider that will as much as
possible utilize the services of the National Road Safety Council (NRSC).

Procurement

4.1.3 The Procurement Section of the RA will be responsible for co—ordinating the
procurement activities for the project. All procurement of goods, works, and related
services, and acquisition of consulting services financed by the ADF will be in

accordance with the Bank’s Rules and Procedures for the Procurement of Goods, Works
and Related Services and Rules and Procedures for the Use of Consultants, using the
relevant Bank Standard Bidding Documents.

Disbursement

4.1.4 The loan will be disbursed for two categories of expenditure including civil works
and consulting services for design review/supervision and Audit Services. The Direct
Payment Disbursement Method will be used for all payments against standard
documentation as specified in the Bank’s ‘Disbursement Handbook’.

Financial Management

4.1.5 The Finance Department of RFA through the Senior Accountant will be
responsible for the financial management and reporting for the project. The Department
has experience in financial management of donor funded projects, is fully staffed and
therefore has the capacity to manage the finances of the project. An accounting and
financial system using the accounting system package SUN systems is operational and
has enhanced accountability, managerial autonomy and financial control. A financial
management manual has been prepared to provide guidance on procedures and guidelines
on financial transactions. The financial management of the RA therefore is in line with
the new Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) which is based on principles of
transparency, accountability for restoration of fiscal control and good governance to
support economic reform. The Financial Department will open and maintain a separate
account for the project, and maintain all the financial records of the projects. Procedures
for project audit will be in accordance with Bank Rules.

4.2 Monitoring

4.2.1 An experienced consulting firm procured in accordance with Bank Rules and
Procedures will supervise the civil works contract and monitor the day to day activities
on site. The Executing Agency (RA) through the project coordinator will submit monthly
reports prepared by the consultant and quarterly reports prepared by the RA in Banks
format. These reports will include physical, financial, social and environmental
indicators, the project has achieved. The reports will also provide updated information on
project implementation, highlighting key issues and problem areas, and recommending
action plans for resolving identified bottlenecks. Copies of these reports will be reviewed
by the Infrastructure Specialist in the Regional Office in Lilongwe to advise the RA prior
to submission to Tunis. In addition, the project will be monitored through the Bank’s
field supervision missions (twice a year), and a mid—term review in the second year of
implementation to identify any major constraints facing the project and provide the
required corrective measures.

4.2.2 Based on the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), the mitigation
measures will be supervised by the consultant and monitored by the officers responsible
for the environment and social issues within the RA in collaboration with the Project
Coordinator. The RA will utilize its environmental guidelines for road works to ensure
the effective implementation of the ESMP. The oversight role of the Directorate of
Environmental Affairs will be sought on a regular basis to ensure compliance with
environmental standards. With regard to monitoring of environmental and social

mitigation measures would be through the ESMP and RAP which has monitorable
indicators for compliance.

4.2.3 At 85% completion the Bank and the Executing Agency will start preparing a
Project Completion Report for submission to the Bank as specified in the General
Conditions. This report, the consultant’s final project report and the Executing Agency’s
performance statistics and financial performance will form the basis of post—evaluation of
the project.

4.3 Governance

4.3.1 The Government of Malawi has shown commitment to fight corruption and
related crimes leading to improved transparency and accountability. In order to sustain
the fight against corruption, the Government of Malawi launched a National Anti—
Corruption Strategy in February 2009 which aims at bringing all stakeholders together in
fighting the graft. Further, Malawi is implementing a Citizens Charter programme with a
view to improve public service delivery, transparency and accountability. Through the
Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS), donors and government have also put the
anti—corruption fight high on agenda by incorporating corruption indicators on the
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) matrix.

4.3.2 Malawi is drawing closer to the fourth multiparty general elections in May 2009.
The Malawi Electoral Commission which is an independent body has successfully
conducted voter registration and received nominations for presidential as well as
parliamentary candidates. These timely preparations should help the Commission to
conduct successful elections that would provide an environment conducive for the
implementation of the project.

4.4 Sustainability

4.4.1 Government has identified transport infrastructure development as one of the
priority focus areas to attain the objectives of the MGDS and an RSP prepared as a
medium term action plan. To that effect an autonomous Roads Fund Administration was
established and has ring fenced financing (from fuel levies and transit fees) for road
maintenance. The Road Fund revenue has increased annually on the average by 18%
from US$7.4 million in 2000 to 19.27 million in 2007.

4.4.2 With respect to the project road maintenance, the contractor will be responsible
during the construction phase and defects liability period. The RA will be responsible for
maintenance of the road through finance from the Road Fund after completion. The
financial requirement for routine maintenance amounts to USD210,000 per year, starting
2014 and USD7.32 million for periodic maintenance in 2020. In 2007/08 the Road Fund
spent USD36.00 million for the routine maintenance of the entire network part of which
was from its revenues totaling US$19.24 million. There was a shortfall in the requirement
of USD16.76 million which the Development Partners supported to close the gap. The
fuel levy has recently been increased by 102% which has doubled the Road Fund
Revenues. On top of this Government is planning to widen the source of revenues by
incorporating road tax, overload fees and a portion of the car licence fees in order to
cover fill the gap in the periodic maintenance requirement. Development Partners,
especially the EU has earmarked Budget Support of EUR50 million for routine and

10

periodic maintenance and EURlO million for capacity building for 2011-2013. Thus with
Road Fund revenue and Development partners support sustainability of the project road is
therefore assured.

4.5 Risk Management

4.5.] Cost Overrun: The risk of increase in project costs due to the volatility of oil
prices and prices of construction materials has been mitigated by basing the cost
estimates on tender rates of recently awarded contracts and provisions have been made
for a contingency amount to cater for possible escalation of prices of materials, labour
and fuel. The bid documents will make provisions for the bidders to list special materials
that are sensitive to oil prices to compensate and reduce pressure on the contractor.

4.5.2 Counterpart Financing: According to the RBSCP (2005—2009) Mid—Term
Review, payment of counterpart financing which has been an issue on past Bank
operations has improved due to improvement of Government’s budget control
effectiveness and efficiency. Enhanced effectiveness and efficiency is expected with a
better management environment resulting from improved governance. Counterpart
financing is therefore assured.

4.5.3 Bank Rules and Procedures: The establishment of the Malawi Field Office
(MWFO) has provided an avenue that can provide information and follow—up on loan
effectiveness requirements and Bank procurement and disbursement procedures to ensure
that the project implementation schedule is adhered to. The staff at MWFO in
consultation with Head Office will be able to deliver support to the Executing Agency on
a daily basis both at pre—implementation and implementation stages of the project.

4.6 Knowledge Building

Knowledge will be built in the RA through counterpart training offered by the
supervision consultant on the recycling technique adopted for the project. The project has
incorporated a capacity strengthening component to support knowledge building in the
environmental and social economic field for both public and private sector personnel that
are involved in transport sector investment projects
