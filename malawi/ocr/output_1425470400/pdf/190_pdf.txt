local government strengthening for effective service delivery and achievement ofa high level of accountability for
development resources. By contributing to common outcomes and outputs, UNDP seeks to achieve greater

accountability with a view to maximize the impact of the resources available, avoid duplications and create
synergies, including by providing a platform for possible joint programmes.

UNCDF programme whose main objective is Poverty Reduction through implementation of the
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy for subsequent attainment of the Millennium
