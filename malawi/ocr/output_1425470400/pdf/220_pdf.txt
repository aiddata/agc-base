THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI

Food security programme for Malawi 2004 - 2006

i-’-‘.'_‘-J“3*-‘-‘-.fnﬁﬂ-‘-“--~-~-“I

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME

The “Food Security Programme for Malawi 2004-2006” consists of the provision of a total

amount of EUR 45 million over 3 years which comprise a foreign exchange facility of EUR 21.3
million and EUR 23.7 million of special commitments.

This ﬁnancing agreement only concerns the second year where EUR 7.9 million will be provided
to the Government of Malawi that will comprise of EUR 4.5 million of foreign exchange
facilities and EUR 3.4 million of special commitments. EUR 7.1 million will be managed directly
by the European Commission for Technical Assistance and support to NGOs.

The overall objectives of the programme ﬁt into the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy. Its
contribution will fall within the following goals: (i) Poverty reduction through sustainable
pro-poor growth; (ii) Creation of an enabling environment for pro-poor growth; (iii) Improving
the quality of life of most vulnerable; (iv) Improving disaster management; (v) Ensure
environmental sustainability and (vi) Increasing gender equality.

The project aims to reduce chronic food insecurity at national and household level through the
implementation of a revised FN SP.

To achieve the purpose over the 3 years, the programme is based on 5 components.

Result 1. Food Security and Nutrition Policy ‘(FSNP) implementation management is
improved

The revised Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FN SP), which was proposed for adoption in July
2004 and agreed at cabinet level in July 2005 will be the overall programme framework with the
aim to improve good governance in food security management. Its implementation will ensure an
effective partnership through efﬁcient inter-sectoral coordination between stakeholders and lead
to a strong ownership in policy/programme and ﬁnancial management in various ministries
related to FNS sector. The proposed programme will also improve the decision making processes
by increasing the overall FNS understanding through better data collection, monitoring and

analysis capacities. The Civil Society will be fully involved in the FNS Policy design and
implementation in line with the recommendation of the CSP review.

Result 2. Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) management is efﬁcient

The proposed programme will continue its support to the National Food Reserve Agency in order
to maintain and improve the management of the SGR and good governance in line with the
recommendation of the CSP review. The ﬁnancial and administrative management of NFRA will
be improved in order to reach the standard level 1809000. The physical stocks of the SGR will
respect the international standard of quality. The SGR management will be in line with regional
standard and the rules for release and replenishment of the SGR set in the standard procedures
will be respected. As a consequence food aid imports will decrease.

Result 3'. Institutional capacity in trade policy is improved

Coordination between GoM, private sectors and other partners in trade related matters for
agricultural products is an essential step to improve the institutional capacity. Institutional
strengthening of Ministry of Economic, Planning and Development (MoEP&D), Ministry of
Agriculture Irrigation and Food Security (MoAIFS) and Ministry of Commerce and Industry
(MoCI) will enhance the Malawian negotiation capacity in multi-lateral, regional and bi-lateral
trade agreements, especially regarding agricultural products.

Result 5. Nutritional status of vulnerable groups improved

The proposed programme will strengthen the capacity of households and communities to
recognise, manage, and prevent malnutrition. Initiated during the 2002 Food Crisis along with the

ﬁnancial support of ECHO, the nutritional support for vulnerable groups through supplementary
feeding will be maintained mainly to address the impact of the HIV/AIDS.

The foreign exchange provided under the programme must be justiﬁed by imports of eligible
food products. The counter-value funds generated by the foreign exchange are to be used for this
project support. The products eligible for import under this foreign exchange facility and the
eligible countries of origin for these products are listed below in Appendices 1 and 2.
