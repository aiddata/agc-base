ll Malawi is a country that faces widespread poverty, with a per capita annual GDP of around
€205. Income inequality IS the highest in Africa With more than 50% of the population livmg

} below the poverty line About 85% of the population live in rural areas and depend almost
I} entirely on subsrstence agriculture With an average annual income per household of less than

major food crop, and its over reliance on tobacco as export earner. .
In order to contribute to the sustainable improvement in the livelihoods of rural commumtles, a

including the poorest. It is based on a bottom-up approach, through consultations and active
participation of local communities. It will encourage business initiatives in the agriculture
sector chosen and implemented by farmers themselves.

providers, traders, credit facilities etc.) will be inter-actively involved in the process.

such as horticultural products using anti-dumping provisions, and to phase out import duties on
some inputs, thus supporting the development of agricultural diversiﬁcation.

Results 3 and 6 are closely linked to the upcoming Institutional Development across the
Agriculture—Food sector (IDAF) to be funded by the EU. The programme is currently in its

design phase and it is important that links to and synergy between the two programmes is
ensured.

2.4. Activities

All programme activities are scheduled to be completed within the planned duration of the

programme. The annual implementation rate by sector is given in Annex 2 of these Technical
and Administrative Provisions.

Inception phase:

Due to its complexity and ambitious nature, the programme needs an initial inception phase, of
six months, to establish a baseline from which to measure progress against plans and to assess

by two separate implementation phases.
Main activities planned for the two phases of implementation are as follows:
Phase I:

This ﬁrst phase will put into place the conditions to enable to carry out the second phase and
the process is to be demand driven and to be a bottom-up approach.

0 Formation of clubs and farmers’ associations.

0 Identiﬁcation of capacity building support, including the training requirements of
extension workers - to be provided by the Natural Resources College (NRC) and Bunda
College of Agriculture (BCA).

0 Identiﬁcation of the viability of the Horticultural Development Association of Malawi

(HODOM) in the areas of skills certiﬁcation and training, MIS management and
product market identiﬁcation.

0 Assistance to business initiatives at village level will be provided through clubs, and
will support the deﬁnition and implementation of small-scale income generating
projects related to diversiﬁcation of agricultural production. This will include the
introduction of new crops, improvement of irrigation technologies within current
wetland (dambo) areas, expansion of fruit and vegetable production, plus the
development of post-harvest handling, storage and processing of crops.

0 Assistance to capacity building will be provided to emerging associations/cooperatives
of farmers. It will be delivered on a cost-sharing basis after an initial assessment of

viability, membership and ﬁnancial management. Assistance will include provision of
ﬁnancial training, consultancy services and equipment.

to ensure that the contextual environment, within which the programme is set, remains valid.
Any revision will be agreed with, and approved by, programme stakeholders. An external

evaluation at the end of the ﬁrst implementation phase will also be carried out, the successﬁll
outcome of which will be the trigger for the second phase.

A set of indicators have been established to be used to measure the

performance/accomplishment of the activities at the end of phase I and will be used as the
trigger of the second phase.

3. IMPLEMENTATION

Technical assistance will b e p rovided to the programme in the form 0 f long-term TA. T he
areas of expertise will be: Programme Coordination, Land Resources Conservation

The respect of the following conditions by Government of Malawi will maximise the
programme impacts:

0 The Government of Malawi’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy is implemented
according to schedule.

0 The Government of Malawi in co-ordination with other projects and programmes
identiﬁes common clear guidelines to avoid duplication of efforts.

0 The MoAIFS shall determine and maintain a long-term strategy on agricultural
development as well a revised national Food Security and Nutrition policy.

0 The MoAIFS shall provide technical backstopping for the activities of the programme
as well as equipment and human resources.

4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

4.1 Monitoring arrangements and follow-up

An internal monitoring unit established during the ﬁrst six months will be staffed with three
ofﬁcers (one TA and two contract ofﬁcers). They will manage the establishment of the baseline
data sets relating to the beneﬁciary farmers and communities and set up the procedures of data
collection and analysis that will be required to monitor the indicators and measure programme
impact.

The PCU will encourage the beneﬁciaries to participate in the monitoring and evaluation of the
activities. Data from community driven monitoring and evaluation will be presented in the

one shall be an annual report. Activities and outputs will be monitored closely and the
indicators of outcome and impact will be documented and the reports will discuss the observed
trends.

There will be an evaluation of the programme at the end of the ﬁrst phase and the outcome of

this evaluation will be the determining factor of whether the second phase will be implemented
or not.

4.2 Reviews, evaluations and audits

External technical monitoring and evaluation reviews shall be undertaken on an annual basis by
an independent international team of consultants selected by the NAO. There shall be a mid-
term and end of programme review conducted by external consultants selected by the EU. The
mid-term review shall form the evaluation of the ﬁrst phase and the result will act as the trigger
for the second phase.

In any event, when total expenditure incurred by the direct-labour component of programme-
estimates is 6 200,000 or more, the expenditure has to be ﬁnancially audited before submission
of the closure report.

Audits must be carried out by approved auditors who are members of an internationally
recognised auditing certification association. Their job is to verify the programme’s accounts
and c ertify that the e xpenditure b y the d irect-labour c omponent o f t he programme-estimates
was committed, validated and paid in accordance with the programme of measures, the budget

An Audit provision is foreseen in the budget of this Financing Agreement. According to
Article 23 of the 9th EDF Financial Regulation, the Chief Authorising Ofﬁcer can use this
provision to organise an independent audit.

through the inclusion of environmental impact assessments in all technical and  _‘

 

The activities of the programme will address the issues related to family planning, especially
those lined to the crosscutting issue of HIV/AIDS where relevant.

3.3 National policy measures

The most important national measure, which has a direct impact on the success of this
programme, is the Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy. The effect and impact of this
programme will be increased if this strategy is properly implemented through selected
policies and objectives as well the adoption in 2004 of a revised National Food security and
nutrition policy which is already in preparation with a EU support

B.4 Institutional and management capacity .
The programme will be housed in the MoAIF S, which is recently undergoing a core funct10n
analyses as to improve its capacity to, amongst others, implement programs like the present

the MoAIF S technical professional staff based at Agricultural Development Division ofﬁces
research stations and the participating district ofﬁces.

’

through the use of external technical resources provided by other programmes such as
MAFSP, Public Works, Micro-Projects, Land Reform, MoAIFS Institutional Reform

support, 9th EDF Forestry Programme, and With other donor—funded projects working in the
rural sector.

In the ﬁeld of support to emerging farmers’ associations, initial assessment of associations
will lead to the exclusion of ad hoc associations that would try to derive short-term beneﬁts
from the p rogramme. On the c ontrary, the p rogramme will b elp clubs and associations to
develop at their own pace and to secure membership through the provision of value for
money services. Strong emphasis will be given to build self-sufﬁciency in HODOM, in

beneﬁts.
