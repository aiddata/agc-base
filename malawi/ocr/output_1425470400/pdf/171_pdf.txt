Dear Mr. Blessings,

Attached please find the invoice for €80,000 for the irish potato project and the invoice for
€335,000 for the sweet potato project.

Please kindly note that the bank accounts for the projects are different. The invoice for irish
potato continues using our Luxembourg bank account and the invoice for sweet potato uses
the new IP morgan account. I hope this is not too confusing.

Please let us know if you should have any questions or comments.

Best regards,

Michelle

Subject: RE: Contract amendment—irish potato project

Michelle,

Thanks for the email. Will be awaiting for the invoice for €80,000 for irish potato project. On the former invoice
of €335,000 please make some correction to reflect that this is full payment for the sweet potato project and
not the 1st tranch payment.

I will make an amendment to the original contract which will have to be signed by both parties to reflect the
additional funding (as per revised proposal sent by Paul Demo) . As soon as | get the €580,000 invoice. i will
kickstart this so tha we send you the amendment by end of the week.

Would appreciate ifl can have this today.

Regards
Blessings

We very much appreciate your support and communication for the preparation of the contracts.
