Factors ensuring sustainability
B.l Ownership by beneﬁciaries

This programme of support to the NAO’s ofﬁce was requested by the government of

Malawi in order to improve NAO’s capacity to effectively manage EC cooperation in
Malawi. The 2003 evaluation of the CSP stressed the n
of the Government to adequately '

implementation as is the case for the Nll’, training of key stalceholders in EDF
procedures to be provided by the support programme will ensure sustainability.

B.2 Cross-sectoral sustainability

_

By facilitating the furtherance of the Commission’s objectives in the area of natural
resource protection — largely through low direct impact activities to be carried out under
all EU-ﬁanded projects - , this project can help achieve this key objective. It can be
further achieved through the development of a programme to support NSAs and,
possibly, by the NAO Support Unit’s assistance in spearheading the identiﬁcation of
projects that could be implemented under the ECWEU Environment Initiative.

8.3. National policy measures

The national policy of the government is to improve economic governance and
management of public resources. The proposed project is also part of the larger
Government objective of strengthening the Debt and Aid Department in the Ministry of
Finance to ensure success with the Govemment’s efforts in taking the lead in prioritising.

implementing. reviewing and evaluating the flow and composition of external assistance
to Malawi.

The Debt and Aid Division in the Ministry of Finance has already started to facilitate aid
coordination and to strengthen aid management. It now also wishes to play a strong role
in designing external assistance programmes. The Ministry’s decision to further
strengthen the NAG Support Unit for this purpose is an illustration of that policy.

The challenge to formulate a more pro-active role in aid programme design is being met
through the formulation of a Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP), which
incorporates projects that are integrated into the Govemment’s Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as well as with annual budgets.

Similarly, the volume and timing of budget support needs to be consistent with the
Govemment’s ﬁscal programme under the IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF). It should also be integrated into the programme of the Reserve
Bank of Malawi’s (REM) for meeting the foreign exchange. requirements of the
Malawian economy. In implementing the proposed project for strengthening the NAG
Support Unit — so that it can effectively contribute towards the design, review,
implementation and evaluation of the EU-programme in Malawi - the Ministry of

Finance will be in a position to demonstrate that it is possible for Government to meet
that challenge.

B.4 Institutional and management capacity

The support programme will address the current lack of institutional and management
capacity in the NAO's office, in line ministries. Strengthening the NAO’s Ofﬁce to
manage EDF assistance will build capacity in the Debt and Aid Department in the
Ministry of Finance — which eo-ordinates official development assistance in Malawi- and

will also extend capacity-building activities to other departments of the governments as
provided for in the CSP/NIP.

B.S Complementarity and sectoral coordination between donors

By strengthening the Debt and Aid Department in the Ministry of Finance, the project
will also improve Government of Malawi‘s capacity to handle other donors' funds.

Coordination with other donors will be ensured through various channels such as the
Donor’Group on Financial and Economic Management and the Common Approach to
Budgetary Support Group (CABS).
