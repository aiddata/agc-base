PLANT BIODIVERSITY OF THE NYIKA NATIONAL PARK:

MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR CONSERVATION AND WISE USE

A collaborative project between
The National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Malawi and

The Norwegian Institute for Nature Research

PLANT BIODIVERSITY OF THE NYIKA NATIONAL PARK:

MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR CONSERVATION AND WISE USE

1. AIM

The aim of the project is to establish in Malawi the basis for management of the biological
diversity of the Nyika National Park by building up local technical capacity in biodiversity issues
and by simultaneously studying key questions related to the ecological factors that underlay
biological diversity in the Nyika ecosystem. The project will form baseline data for future

monitoring and is directed at two major issues.

The ﬁrst focus is on the compilation and organization of extant and newly acquired knowledge
about the biological richness of the National Park in a manner that this knowledge can be used
for planning of biodiversity management and monitoring. This component of the project will
support "the starting phase of a long-term activity directed at assembling and organising
information on biodiversity in Malawi that will be conducted at the Centre for Biodiversity,
housed at the National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens (Department of Environmental Affairs,

1998).

The second focal point will be on biological diversity from an ecological perspective. Within the
National Park and in the associated buffer zones, the focus will be on the regeneration of
woodland species and on the effect of collecting wild plants for food consumption, medicinal
use, and for fuel, and construction purposes in order to manage these resources in a sustainable

manner.

2. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

D To build up capacity in Malawi in compilation and organisation of data for management
planning towards conservation and wise use.

D To establish a system for assessment and monitoring of biological diversity in the Nyika

National Park, including its associated buffer zone.

El To build up capacity in Malawi in conducting research to support management practices for
conservation and sustainable use.

D To study regeneration along the woodland/grassland boundary, with emphasis on the role of
ﬁre and grazing to support conservation and prescribed ﬁre practices.

D To understand the effect of current harvesting of plant resources on the vegetation and ﬂora
in the Nyika ecosystem in order to reduce subjective decision-making on sanctioning quotas
for harvest.

El To promote expertise and knowledge transfer among institutions within Malawi and between

Malawi and Norway.

3. BACKGROUND

The core of the Nyika National Park is the Nyika Plateau, which listedas one of the most
important afromontane centres of plant biodiversity (Davis, Heywood, & Hamilton, 1994).
Together with the Mulanje Mountains, it is one of the high-diversity sites identiﬁed in Malawi
(Kamundi, 1998). Because of its isolated nature, the plateau holds a unique ﬂora with a
considerable number of endemisms (The Wye College Expedition, 1997) as well as small

remnant populations occurring at the border of their distribution range (Fuller, 1993).

The vegetation on the plateau proper contrasts with that of the hills to the north and south, which
are covered by Brachystegia woodlands (nearly 60 % of the Park) (Johnson). In 1978, the Park
boundary was extended to include all of the plateau escarpments and most of the north-east and
south hill zones. The major reason for the extension was to protect the water catchments of the
four major rivers originating on the plateau (Gordon, 1993; Johnson). These rivers are of major
importance to northern Malawi as a source of dry season water for irrigation (Johnson).
Recently, a 5 km wide ‘buffer zone’ along the Park border has been assigned to local

communities for harvesting (G. Mphepo, personal comm).

Despite its values for biodiversity conservation and for ecosystem ﬁanction protection, the Nyika
National Park, including the recently proposed ‘buffer zone’ lack an adequate management plan
and collaborative efforts to protect its unique biota and to sustainably use its natural resources.
Main constraints are insufﬁcient information about the magnitude and distribution of its
biological diversity, a poor understanding of the ecological processes that maintain this diversity,

and the lack of a scientiﬁc basis to establish harvest quotas.

By ratifying the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) the Government of Malawi has
committed itself to conserve and sustainably use this diversity. Despite the strong political will
shown by the government of Malawi (e. g. (Kabwaza, 1998), limited economic power and
technical capacity, lack of alternatives and rampant poverty threaten the fulﬁlment of this
commitment. Current funding for the Govemment-supported research institutions in Malawi is
too small to sustain extensive research on the biodiversity of the park. External funding for
research, capacity building, and development and implementation of management plans is

therefore required.

Future work on three main issues, i. e. compilation and organization of extant and new data,
research on key ecological factors, and assessment of the effect ofharvest on plant resources will
signiﬁcantly contribute to match the commitments of CBD (identiﬁcation and monitoring of
biodiversity (art.7); in situ conservation (art. 8); sustainable use of components of biological
diversity (art. 10). At the same time, a tight collaboration between the National Herbarium and
Botanic Gardens of Malawi (NHBGM) and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA)
will meet the commitment of research and training (art. 12); and of exchange of information (art.
17), as well as the CBD efforts for the establishment and implementation of the Clearing House
Mechanism (CHM).

3.1 Compilation and organisation of biodiversity data for management planning

Planning for the conservation of biological diversity requires identiﬁcation and knowledge about
its distribution. Not only biodiversity information for the Nyika is insufﬁcient for management
purposes, but also the extant knowledge is not available and organised to serve management

purposes for both government and the surrounding local communities and stakeholders.

Botanical reports about the Nyika date back to late 19th century e. g Whyte (1896) and Henderson
(1900) as cited by (Mill, 1979). Later, some intensive botanical collections have been carried out
in localised areas of the Park (Brass, 1953; Mill, 1979; The Wye College Expedition, 1972; The
Wye College Expedition, 1997; Williamson, 1979), together with some records and collections
of invertebrates and reptiles (The Wye College Expedition, 1997). The lists of higher plants are
suggestive of a high degree of endemism in the Plateau (Mill, 1979) but as the lists are from a

few localities, the extent of endemism on the plateau is likely to be incompletely documented.

4

Primarily collection, identiﬁcation and curation of cryptogams is very incomplete (Kamundi,

1998).

The proposed project aims at extending the surveys into inadequately known areas, at assessing
the spatial and temporal distribution of diversity and of the environment associated with this
distribution, and at compiling extant and newly collected information in a manner readily

accessible for management planning.

Currently, this knowledge is not organised in Malawi to serve management purposes. Present
activities at the NHBGM include: i) contributing with the botanical aspect of environmental
impact assessment, ii) carrying out in-situ and ex-situ conservation of indigenous ﬂora of
Malawi, iii) collecting ethnobotanical information and iv) providing information on the
conservation status of the ﬂora of Malawi (Kamundi, 1998). In addition, the role of the NHBGM
as a depository of biodiversity documentation in Malawi has been recently strengthened by its
designation as host of the National Invertebrate Identiﬁcation and Biodiversity Centre
(Department of Environmental Affairs, 1998). The efﬁciency of the activities carried out by the
Herbarium and the Centre would be signiﬁcantly enhanced by the application of modern
techniques for information organisation and management. This component of the project will
therefore serve two purposes. First, it will organise the data on biological diversity of one of the
two important biodiversity centres in Malawi. Second, it will act as a pilot case to establish the
basis for future work on biodiversity information management at the NHBGM and the at the

Biodiversity Centre.

3.2 The dynamics of woodland/grassland boundaries
In depth studies on key ecological factors associated with the maintenance of biodiversity are
also crucial for management decisions. Current knowledge of the vegetation of the Nyika Plateau

is primarily descriptive (Chapman & White, 1970; Dowsett-Lemaire, 1985).

Montane grassland covers a large area of the plateau (Jackson, 1969; Rattray & Wild, 1961;
Wild & Grandvaux Barbosa, 1967) with several patches of montane evergreen forests. This
occurrence of forest patches embedded within the greater expanse of montane grasslands attracts
studies that will lead to a better understanding of the forest-grassland ecotones which offer

several niches to a diversity of birds and animals.

Boundaries between grassland and woodland in grassland/savanna vegetation are usually
dynamics (Archer, 1995b). They result from ecological interactions between woody and
grassland species, particularly during the establishment phase (Barnes & Archer, 1996;
McPherson & Wright, 1989). Various ecological factors, typically, climate ﬂuctuations,
herbivory and ﬁre mediate the outcome of these interactions (Archer, 1995a; McPherson, 1993;

Weltzin, Archer, & Heitschmidt, 1997).

In the Nyika plateau these interactions are poorly understood. It is believed that ﬁres in the
woodlands prevent regeneration of woody species (Dewar, 1993; Fuller, 1993; Gordon, 1993). It
is also generally believed that forest patches on the Plateau were more extensive but have
receded due to the activities of Iron Age man on the Nyika i.e\-iron smelting on the plateau led to
a huge consumption of hardwood for charcoal and an increase in wildﬁre (Mill, 1979). However,
this view has recently been challenged by the analysis of Quaternary palynological data
(Meadows & Linder, 1993) suggesting that environmental changes, especially of the late

Quaternary have been important in establishing present vegetation patterns.

Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that ﬁre constitutes a key ecological factor of the Nyika
ecosystem. Prescribed ﬁres, aimed primarily at attracting wildlife, are currently applied in the
Park. Because of the belief that ﬁre represses regeneration of woody species, ﬁres are
deliberately avoided in woodland patches. However, the effects of this practice on the vegetation
have not been adequately documented. Some research has been conducted at the Park aiming to
assess the effect of ﬁre timing on plant composition (Anon., 1993). As the focus has only been
few target grassland species, there is a lack of a satisfactory understanding of the effects of

prescribed ﬁres on the vegetation overall. These issues need to be researched further.

Therefore, a study designed to determine the factors associated with the dynamics of forest-
grassland boundaries will be carried out with special focus on ﬁre and on plant-animal
interactions along the forest-grassland ecotone. One of the selected study objects will be a stand
of Juniperus procera that forms a localised community in the eastern edge of the Plateau. The
species of which there were valuable and extensive forests in Kenya (Fuller, ‘1993; Kerfoot,
1964), has a disjunct distribution and the isolated forest on the Plateau represents its most

southerly occurrence. From a conservation and scientiﬁc point of view, it is of great importance

6

that the ecological conditions that act on recruitment and maintenance of remnant populations

are understood.

3.3 Sustainable harvest of plant resources

There is no evidence of permanent human occupation on the high plateau (Mill, 1979). However,
settlements have occurred within the current National Park limits. In 1978, when the Park
boundary was extended, several local villages were resettled outside the new boundary (Johnson;

Ziegler, 1993).

There were two reasons for the extension. The ﬁrst was to protect the role of the Nyika Plateau
and its outliers in guaranteeing perennial water supplies to surrounding communities (Johnson).
By then, there was clear evidence of habitat degradation along the northern escarpmentpf the
Plateau as well as in the country lying ﬁlrther north (i. e. the ”northern extension”) (Ziegler,
1993). Secondly, several species of animals were known to live in this area and they needed
better protection: eland, roan antelope and zebra move from the Plateau down to the woodlands

during the dry season to search for better forage (Johnson).

Recently, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife has proposed to establish a buffer zone
of 5 km along the Park border where local communities may make use of natural resources
following certain regulations (G. Mphepo, personal comm.) These resources comprise to a large
extent plants (see Appendix ). Preliminary harvest quotas have been set by a tentative appraisal
of resource availability (Mphepo, 1998; Msiska, 1997). In order to establish harvest quotas for a
sustainable utilization of these resources, the effects of harvesting on plant population stands
need to be adequately assessed. There is a risk that plant resources will be overexploited and land

degradation processes will revert if the resources are not properly used.

4. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

4.1 The Nyika National Park

The Nyika National Park is found in the northern region of Malawi, lying astride Chitipa,
Karonga and Rumphi districts. The core of the park is the Nyika high plateau which lies above
1800 m above sea level covering, about 1800 km2 of which 70 km2 are on the Zambian side on
the west (Dorward & Dorward, 1993). The plateau is a shoulder of the African Rift Valley
system dividing two major faults marked by Lake Malawi and the Luangwa Valley (Zambia),

7

with the eastern and western slopes falling away sharply while the land to the north and south
descends through a series of steep hills and valleys (Carke, 1983).

The Nyika plateau constitutes an important watershed which is the source of some major rivers
in the Northern Region of Malawi, providing water for agriculture and domestic use to about half
a million people. In Wovwe River, a hydropower plant provides electricity for most of the
surrounding human population of Northern Region of Malawi. The stable water ﬂow of rivers
safeguards the ﬁsheries of Lake Malawi. On the western side of the plateau, the rivers feed the
Luangwa river-system in the eastern sector of Zambia. Conservation of plant diversity is
important to maintain healthy watershed functions, by regulating run-off, inﬁltration and
preventing soil erosion. The importance of the watersheds in the region for securing water supply

resulted in the extension of the National Park area in 1978 (Johnson; Ziegler, 1993).

4. 2 Methods

4.2.1 Inventory, mapping and compilation of plant biodiversity data

The development of new techniques and methods for geographical analysis has signiﬁcantly
changed the potential to organise spatial information for management purposes. These
techniques allow to analyse spatial distributions together with ecological processes at a wide
range of spatial and temporal scales by combining qualitative and quantitative features of the
landscape (Bridgewater, 1993). The advantage with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is
that it can be used to integrate data of very different character, i. e. vegetation type, soil type,
species occurrence, population size, community type, land use, satellite images, air photography,

etc.

In the initial phase the main activities will entail the mapping of the principal vegetation types
covering the Plateau. Data for this exercise will be drawn from existing topographic maps of the
150,000 and 1:250,000 series as well as the aerial photographs. The current features of
vegetation physiognomic units will be accessw from satellite imageries. The extent of areas
covered by the various vegetation types will be correlated with geological formation and soil
types. Maps depicting topographic features, geological formations, soil types and resultant

vegetation types will be generated by the GIS unit to be set up at the National Herbarium and

Botanic Gardens of Malawi in Zomba, Malawi, where staff from Malawi will be trained by

Norwegian experts.

These maps will be used to design a stratiﬁed sampling scheme of biodiversity. Species
occurrences will be sampled by selecting nested permanent plots within a grid covering the Park.
Nested permanent plots will be established as a basis for a monitoring scheme, i. e. species
dynamics at different spatial scale (Herben, Krahulec, Hadincové, & Kovarova, 1993; leand,
1995a; leand, 1995b; Herben, 1996). Species composition at each site will be used as a
bioassay to characterise habitat types. In addition it will be related to a series of such abiotic
gradients as soil type and pH, temperature, moisture regimes, topographic aspect and slope.
Systematic collection of plants will be undertaken in various vegetation types in poorly surveyed
areas. Sampling will be conducted by staff of the NHBGM, the Departmentwf National Parks of
Malawi and NINA, Norway.

Plant specimens will be identiﬁed in Malawi, Sweden, South Africa, and other herbaria. The
overall determinations will constitute the core material for the development of a comprehensive
inventory of plants and the creation of an electronic database for the National Park, which will be
built up in a GIS system. This database will be the basis for future organisation and management
of biodiversity data in Malawi. The proposed project will be a direct contribution to Malawi’s
National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan which has identiﬁed plant inventory, monitoring

and evaluation as priority for the country.

4.2.2 Dynamics of woodland/grassland boundaries

The effect of ﬁre and grazing on the regeneration of woody species within the woodland and in
the grassland will be assessed by establishing a series of experimental plots where grazing and
ﬁre regime will be manipulated. Survival of newly emerged seedlings will be recorded in
naturally occurring seedlings and in controlled sowing experiments. Potential sources of seedling
damage will be recorded. This experiment will aim at establishing the signiﬁcance of ﬁre as a

management tool in the Park and other associated ecosystems.

Recruitment in remnant forest patches, as in the case of the Juniperus procera “forest, may be

limited not only by unsuitable habitat conditions for establishment, or as a result of biotic

interactions, but also due to scarce seed production and/or low seed viability. We aim to estimate
the magnitude of the seed rain, Seed bank, and to conduct seed viability tests to assess possible
limitations to regeneration (Bakker, Poschold, Strykstra, Bekker, & Thompson, 1996; Schupp,
1990). Seed rain will be estimated by seed collection in traps. Viability and germination
requirements of seeds collected in traps, from tree crowns and from the ground will be
determined in the laboratory. A series of sowing experiments will be carried out to assess
microsite requirements for germination and establishment (Grubb, 1977; Silvertown & Smith,

1988; Milton, 1995).

4.2.3 Sustainable use of plant resources in the buffer zone

An ethnobotanical survey of a representative group of all communities around the Nyika plateau
area will be carried out. Interviews will be conducted using aquestionnaire to collect information
such as vernacular names of species used, purpose of use, plant part harvested, habitat sources
and general demographic information. Community forest proﬁling will be carried out using
participatory rural appraisal (PRA) to collect information on: community background and forest
history, community forest values and perceptions, spatial and temporal distribution, inventory
and classiﬁcation of useful resources, as well as forest products scoring and ranking. Where
possible, transect walks will be carried out with samples of local people in different areas of the

park to collect additional information on plants used. Respondents will be sampled from various

age groups.

Ecologically comparable areas with different intensities of human inﬂuence will be identiﬁed
with the help of recent air surveys together with land controls. A few key-resource plant species
will be identiﬁed either because of their value to local communities, or because of high
conservation value. Population studies aiming to assess extant biomass and/or population
numbers, as well as recruitment and productivity will be carried out in comparable habitats
subject to various intensities of human use. Also, various experiments will be set up to study the

effect of harvest intensity and timing on stand productivity and population recruitment.

5. ORGANISATION

The focal point in Malawi will be the National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Malawi
(NHBGM), in co—operation with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife, Forestry
Department, Department of Environmental Affairs, and University of Malawi. The NHBGM was
formed in 1987 to house all the representative herbarium collections in the country, and in 1998
it was selected among 10 other national institutions to host the National Invertebrate
Identiﬁcation and Biodiversity Centre (Department of Environmental Affairs, 1998). Under the
National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan Project (NBSAP), the NHBGM was also the
leader of the plant biodiversity component. The component identiﬁed inventory of Malawi’s
plants and capacity building for taxonomists as a ﬁrst priority for the country. This selection was
based on the NHBGM’s capacity regarding collection and museum services. In this way, the
capacity built at the NHGBM on biodiversity data management will "serve the National
Biodiversity Centre as well. The maintenance and expansion of these activities are in need of

considerable external support.

In Norway, the focal point will be Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), in co-
operation with the University of Uppsala. NINA will be responsible for the data base
management and GIS training, and will assist with expertise in the fields of planning, setting up
and conducting the studies on ecological issues, i. e. spatio-temporal variation of biodiversity,
woodland/ grassland boundaries, and population studies of useful plant species. The Department
of Plant Systematics at the Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University will assist with
plant identiﬁcations and with ethnobotanical studies. The Department has a long experience on

work regarding African ﬂoras.

Other projects of particular relevance to the proposed project where collaboration will be needed
are the GTZ Border Zone Project, and the GTZ Core Zone Project being implemented in
collaboration with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife. The former project is working
on community based infrastructure development in and around the Nyika National Park in
Malawi whereas the latter is zoning the area for effective management. The present project will
liase with these and other ongoing activities, e.g., Southern Africa Botanical Diversity Network

(SABONET), and SADC Biodiversity Support Project, both with funding from the Global

11

Environmental Facility (GEF) and implemented by the UNDP. This collaboration will ensure

that synergy is maintained.

6. ACTIVITY PLAN AND TIME SCHEDULE.

 

The project is planed to run for a period of 5 years. The ﬁrst group of activities to be initiated
will be those related with the assessment of broad-scale patterns from air photos and satellite
images in order to establish sampling sites for diversity monitoring and collections. Extant data
will be searched and compiled in electronic data base format. Also the sampling sites and the
experimental set up for the woodland/grassland ecotone and the resource utilisation sub-projects
will be established. These activities are planned to stretch over a period of approximately 1 year.

At a second stage, the core of the sampling and ﬁeldwork activities will be carried out. These
activities will include biodiversity records, ecological studies about woodland regeneration, and
ethnobotanical and harvest studies. This stage is aimed to stretch during a period of 2 years. The
compilation of the ﬁeld guide will also be carried out during this period.

12

The third and ﬁnal stage will encompass a third ﬁeld season for the ecological studies, data
compilation, writing up of doctoral thesis and publication preparation. These activities will
extend for two years.

7. REPORTING AND OUTPUTS

The capacity to undertake the above activities using local resources in Malawi is low. The much-
needed facilities are generally lacking while personnel needs training in data organisation and
manipulation for management purposes, biodiversity and ecological issues. To ensure the smooth
running of the project, expertise from Norway and other partners would work alongside local
scientists. Capacity building is necessary to enable Malawi to effectively implement the project
and ﬁll gaps in the ﬁeld of biodiversity management. A major output of the project will be the
establishment of a system of data organisation in electronic format which will constitute the core
of information management on biodiversity in Malawi. This will include equipment based at the
National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Malawi and training of personnel at NHBG, the

Centre of Biodiversity and National Parks.

The interaction and collaboration between local staff at the NHBGM and the Department of
Wildlife and National Parks, and staff from NINA, Norway will provide on the job training and

13

impart the necessary skills; in ﬁeld work and data analysis. This project would go a long way to
implement these aspects of the CBD.

Within the project, three MSc students and two PhD students ﬁ'om Malawi will be trained. The
students will preferably be attached to‘the local universities or universities in the region, but
attachment to universities outside the region may also be feasible (e.g., "sandwich"

programmes).

One of the outputs of the project will be a ﬁeld guide of the Nyika ﬂora. The guide will contain colour
plates and ecological information about ca 200 species (i. e. description of the habitat,
distribution, status, etc.). It will be the copyright of the NHBGM.

Other publications will be those related to the research conducted by graduate students and
scientists, in international journals. The project personnel will be available for any form of

communication about issues related to the project.

14

8. ECONOMY

The project will require a funding of approximately 14 million Norwegian crowns (ca USD 2

million) for the entire period of 5 years. A majority of the expenses will need to be incurred

during the course of the ﬁrst year or ﬁrst stage of the project.
