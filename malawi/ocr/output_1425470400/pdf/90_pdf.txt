1. Background to the Malawi Public Service Charter Programme (MPSCP)

The origin of the MPSCP lies in the long—term commitment of the Government of Malawi (60M) to
improve the access to basic services for all people in Malawi. Malawi is signatory to the African
Public Service Charter of February 2001. The African Union (AU) has during 2009-10 developed a
second generation Service Charter, which Malawi is expected to ratify as a member of AU.

The GoM has since 2009 developed the Malawi Public Service Charter. The Malawi Public Service
Charter encompasses a definition and summary of what constitutes Public Service, broader
services for which the Public Service has a measure of responsibility, the core values and principles
of public service, and citizen’s feedback mechanisms. It is designed to provide a framework against
which all public institutions (national and district level) will develop their service charters.

Despite the commitments of successive governments, Malawi continues to face challenges in
ensuring that public services are delivered efficiently. The challenges are more pronounced in rural
areas where about 85% of Malawi’s population live. According to the Welfare Monitoring Survey
2008, it is estimated that the poverty rate in Malawi is at 40% and that about 15% of the people of
Malawi live under conditions of extreme poverty.

One of the most notable problems for many poor families, especially in rural communities, is the
continued lack of access to basic services. However, basic services are essential, as they provide a
minimum safety net for the poor and are the prerequisite for human development and freedoms.
Their absence seriously threatens the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. Thus, despite
tremendous progress in adopting development-oriented legislation and policies and efforts
towards reaching policy targets, gaps remain in the delivery of basic services and this is particularly
apparent in rural areas of Malawi.

The MPSCP is one of several initiatives by the GoM to ensure improved service delivery to the
people who need it the most. The quality and targeting of services is crucial to improve the
livelihood of poor people in Malawi.

Food security is an example of an area where the performance of the local staff plays an important
part in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable groups. Service charters will be used for
guiding and support the local staff in delivering services that match the needs and produce
genuine improvement in food security for poor people.

A number of relevant Service Charter initiatives have already started in some public institutions,
for example passport services in the Department of Immigration. Likewise, a District level charter
Pilot Project is nearing completion three Districts: Salima, Ntchisi and Blantyre City particularly in
the areas of Agriculture, Education, Health, Water, Police and Social Welfare.

Whereas the pilot projects have been implemented by an NGD, the MPSCP is a government led
programme.

The pilot District level service charters in Malawi came about through a partnership between the
Malawi Human Rights and Resource Centre and the Danish Institute for Human Rights with
support from GTZ and Irish Aid.

 

 

During consultations with GoM throughout 2008 and 2009 it became clear that Government were
determined to adopt the concept of service charter and planned a comprehensive implementation
programme of public service charters in Malawi. While the initial service charter activities had
been NGO led, the formulation of the MPSCP throughout 2009 and the implementation of the
programme from 2010 is Government led.

The development partners GTZ, lrish Aid and EU have been actively engaged in supporting the
formulation of the MPSCP throughout 2010.

The MPSCP builds on the pilot phase and seeks to support and facilitate the introduction of Service
Charters in all public institutions. The MPSCP objective is to build a service culture in the public
service align the charters with budget, planning, monitoring and performance management
procedures and the decentralisation process and introduce mechanisms for public participation
and feedback.

The overall responsibility for the roll out of service charters in Malawi lies with the Office of the
President and Cabinet. The Chief Secretary has appointed a MPSCP Steering Committee chaired by
PSA Charles Msosa on behalf of the Chief Secretary. The PS for Reforms and the Public Sector
Reforms Management Unit (PSRMU) is assigned the day-to—day operational responsibility for the
roll out and management of the MPSCP.

The Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) provided technical assistance for the Formulation
Project of the MPSCP as well as The District Pilot Project since 2008. Development Partners have
provided funding for these projects via DIHR. The collaboration between 60M and DIHR has been
based on a Memo of Understanding (MoU). For the implementation of this one-year project in
support of the MPSCP an updated MoU between the 60M and DlHR will be signed.

Although the MPSCP is not formally launched it should be noted that a number of activities have
started. The OPC, MoLGRD, MoAFS, MoH, MoETS, MoWI Department of Immigration, et al. are all
in the process of formulating service charters. Moreover MoLGRD have set up a task team for the
roll out of District level charters and a cluster of 10-12 Districts are now engage in the initial
processes of service charter formulation and implementation.

During the first year of the MPSCP it will be of crucial importance to establish a smooth,
constructive and result—oriented dialogue between the partners of the MPSCP, i.e. the
Development Partners (DP) and the GoM. The institution of these arrangements will be an
important priority in forthcoming months. Coordination with DPs will be within all existing forums
of the MPSCP management structure, i.e. the Steering Committee and the Technical Committee
nationally and the MoLGDR Component implementation Committee and relevant programme
management structures at District level.

The MPSCP is ambitious and complex, and requires a sustained engagement to achieve the
programme’s objectives and the considerable number of specific outputs within each component.
The first year of the MPSCP will be guided by the implementation plan and will ensure the
following:

0 National level Public Service Charters for the selected sectors are developed i.e.
I AgricUlture, Health, Education, Water, and Local Government.
0 At least 10 Districts have formulated and are implementing District Service Charters.

0 Dialogue structures between citizens, District authorities and service providers are
established and operational in 10 Districts.

0 Monitoring and Reporting systems are established in 10 Districts.

0 Civic education is undertaken in 10 Districts.

0 A robust implementation framework for MPSCP is established, including dialogue
structures between DP and GOM, integrated financial and progress reporting in
compliance DP requirements and providing an overview of financial and in—kind
contributions of both DP and GoM contributions.

2. The rational of service charters

The GoM is party to the Africa Public Service Charter, which defines a framework to guide the
Public Service in Africa. This is mirrored in the Malawi Public Service Charter that includes such
principles as equality, neutrality, legality and continuity as well as standards on accessibility,
participation, quality, transparency and responsiveness.

The concept of Service Charters has in recent years been implemented in a number of countries
but most coherently in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Denmark and India. Spurred by the
adoption of the African Public Service Charter countries such as Ghana, Namibia, Uganda, Kenya
and South Africa have also introduced Service Charter Systems.

Charters are short, easy-to-read public documents that set out clear standards for service delivery
as well as a commitment to central values that guide public service delivery. Charters include
information on:

o The mandate and functions of the service provider
0 What kind of services the institution offers;

0 The standards of services customers can expect, including procedural standards on non—
discrimination, openness and others;

o Customer’s basic rights and responsibilities;
0 How to contact and communicate with the Institution; and

o How to provide feedback or make a complaint.

The approach of the GoM is to build a Services Charter System that also reflects constitutional
rights and guarantees. The approach seeks to integrate key lessons from the implementation of
human rights standards. This includes a focus on the accessibility of services, an emphasis on the
processes of service delivery and how they reflect such core values as equity, dignity, and
inclusion, and finally ensuring a firm basis in the Constitution and other relevant legal instruments.

The MPSCP will integrate elements drawn from the countries where the implementation of
Service Charters has been most successful including:

0 Ensuring that standards are feasible, realistic and linked to planning and budgeting;

o Linking government policy deveIOpment, service implementation and the system of
administrativejustice;

- Ensuring the involvement of decentralized structures and frontline staff whe I
charters;

 
 

 

0 Ensuring both institutional and individual consequences for non-performance according to
standards;

0 Ensuring ongoing monitoring of standards;

0 Involvement of the public both in the formulation and ongoing monitoring of standards; and

0 Ensuring an effective feedback and complaints system is put in place.

The experiences show that the introduction of Service Charters, when successful, will not be a
standalone activity, but rather the central part of a system that focuses on dialogue, monitoring
and reporting, accountability, performance assessment, and public inclusion. Reflecting this
multifaceted approach in the context of Malawi, the methodology of the Programme will ensure
that the Service Charter System:

o Is a mechanism for translating constitutional rights and policy priorities into simple and
tangible standards, thereby providing a national framework that assists the Government
to focus and deliver on its national, regional and international commitments.

0 Supports an integrated strategy for addressing and combating corruption;

0 Systematically strengthens the availability of information on public service performance at
district and national level. This has potential to enhance the capacity of Government,
independent institutions, civil society and the donor community to monitor the quality,
equity and efficiency of resource utilization in the delivery of services by the various duty-
bearers at all levels;

0 Provides a strong performance measurement and accountability tool mainstreaming
standards into sector monitoring procedures and strengthening the inclusion of the public
in monitoring and performance audits;

0 Structures the interaction between Local Governments, the National Local Government
Finance Committee (NLGFC) and Central Government through the introduction of
standards for service delivery in the allocation of budgets;

- is a tool for strengthening community empowerment initiatives by providing simple
accessible information on the quality of services as well as formal and informal
mechanisms for public dialogue, citizen monitoring and demands for accountability.

Poor services and service delivery are not just an issue of capacity and lack of funding. Poor
management and the ineffective use of funds increases the scarcity of resources. Due to weak
accountability mechanisms, low transparency and lack of community empowerment, problems of
poor services and corruption can remain unresolved. In particular the livelihood of the poorest
people is hampered by such circumstances. A rights based approach to service charters focuses
service delivery on poor people and vulnerable groups. Participatory processes and charters are
distributed in relevant languages and will also be communicated through other channels that
ensure the inclusion of all targeted groups regardless literacy abilities, gender, social barriers, etc.

The expected tangible results will be:

c - Better service delivered from public institutions to end-users.
0 Clear information about which services will be provided by each institution.
0 Channels for influencing the priorities in service delivery through participatory arrangements.

0 Institutions will be expected to comply with the standards established for each service
delivered

0 Institutions will increase responsiveness to end-user suggestions and complaints.

3. Status of the progress on service charters in Malawi

The MPSCP activities have already started. The MPSCP was formulated through a comprehensive,
participatory process with a broad range of stakeholders throughout 2008 —- 2010. Included in this
process were a number of planning baseline studies, study tours and desk research activities
undertaken. The purpose was to establish the strongest possible experience based foundation for
the formulation of the MPSCP.

Parallel to this a District level service charter Pilot Project was initiated in the districts of Salima,
Ntchisi and Blantyre City. The Pilot Project was initiated in Salima in June 2008. The two additional
districts were added late 2009 and are expected to be finalised by June 2011. One purpose of the
Pilot Project is to generate lessons learned that are specific to the Malawi context.

A Programme Support Document (PSD) was ready by March 2010. The Development Partners
(Dle, lrish Aid, GTZ, EU) jointly submitted a number of valuable comments to improve the PSD.

During a Joint Workshop held on the 9th June 2010 with all key-stakeholders a number of
programme revisions were agreed, including a budget downsizing of about 35%. The total MPSCP
five-year budget is as of now approximately EURO 9.7 million (USD 13.6 million). GoM has
committed funding of EURO 3.57 million (USD 5 million).

Due to changes in development partner priorities the MPSCP is not fully funded. Therefore it has
been decided to phase and re-sequence the programme. The Steering Committee for the MPSCP
in its meeting on the 14th September 2010 agreed to start the MPSCP in November 2010 and
approved the MPSCP revisions, the phased programming approach and the additional fundraising
required.

The MPSCP support document has been submitted to the Chief Secretary for final approval and
agreement to formally launch the MPSCP.

The 60M and DP direct dialogue has been ad hoc and recently a new coordination mechanism has
been agreed. An ongoing 60M and DP coordination will enhance the possibilities for improved
MPSCP internal coordination and implementation, as well as coordination with other
programmes and projects.

The further fundraising, will be needed and a clear donor coordination mechanism, which can
optimize available resources will encourage other partners to engage with the MPSCP.

The MPSCP has a defined programme management structure including 60M and DP coordination,
which should be fully, established during the first half of 2011.

3.1. The Pilot Project

The Pilot Project is nearing completion in three Districts: Salima, Ntchisi and Blantyre City and
includes the following steps:

- Formulation and promotion of the Service Charters.
- Implementation of the Service Charter Standards.

 

— Community empowerment and service provider accountability
- Monitoring and reporting process and systems

As such the pilot project examines the challenges of formulating charters at district level and
works with the basic structures for its implementation through district level processes. The pilot
Districts will be included in the first cluster of Districts for District level charters as part of the

MPSCP.

Although the Pilot Project will not be finalised until mid 2011 a number of lessons learned and
experiences can be extracted and used to feed into the refinement and further roll out of District

level charters.

3.2. Lessons learned from the Pilot Project

Lessons learned from the Pilot Project follows the above listed process stages of the service

charter implementation:

Guidelines for Service Charter at District level:
The stages for the Service Charter formulation and implementation needs
to be documented in guidelines, which can be consulted by the involved

actors at District level.

Need for involving a wide range of stakeholders very early in the
formulation process:

In order to enhance the public ownership, participation should take place
early.

Need for involvement of high ranking officers:

Mandate and priorities of district management must be ensured.

Need for periodic review of service charters:

Priorities and needs change over time. Service charters should be seen as
dynamic documents that are subject to periodic adjustments.

 

 

Implementation of
the Service Charter
Standards.

 

Need for involvement of high ranking officers:

Mandate and priorities of district management must be ensured.

Need for ensuring knowledge among staff about policies and

strategies:

The staff must be trained and informed about service policies and
standards.

Clear and understandable language in service charters is

important.

Need for sector staff involvement at all levels:

To ensure that an eventual Service Charter is not just a workshop paper, a
clear system of interrelation between sub-committee members and the
sector management and employees must be designed from the start,
stressing that they are acting as "representatives" to ensure knowledge
and input of all levels of staff.

Need for Staff re-orientation and motivation,

which is key to successfully implement a Public Service Charter. Some
organisations have incorporated a Performance Management system as a
strategy to motivate the staff to deliver. ln Salima, there is both a
monetary and non-monetary rewards to the performers identified through
the performance assessment they have put in place.

 

 

 

 

Need for involving a wide range of stakeholders very early in the

Need for involvement of high ranking officers:

reporting Process and Need for Monitoring of the performance,
Systems which is key at all stages and feedback is equally required. Salima

local assembly has set monitoring teams at all stages i.e district,
sub-district and the village level. Members from various
stakeholders constitute the teams.

Need for sector-specific differentiation:

Performance of the Public Service Charter has been dependent on
the sector and possibly past orientation i.e in Salima Health
workers have shown more remarkable progress than the security.
The explanation could be that health workers have always seen
themselves as carers of the people yet security workers may be
seen as protectors.

 

 

 

The MoLGRD have already started the roll out process. As part of this the Ministry task team has
participated in site-visits to the pilot Districts. The experiences and lessons learned have informed
the task team, and this knowledge will inform and influence the specific design and planning of the
roll out processl.

From this visit additional lessons learned have been compiled:

o More focus on empowering district level structures such as the Area Service User
Committees, and enhance community sensitization on services offered by sectors under
district councils and their respective standards if communities are to indeed hold Service
Providers accountable for services offered.

0 A comprehensive baseline survey focusing on customer perceptions on institutional
service delivery should always be undertaken to bench mark the service standard setting
process.

0 The District Commissioners’ office as the secretariat for the district council needs to
develop their own Customer Service Charter (CSC) to set the pace for the sectors under it.
It was observed that the secretariat do not have a CSC.

- Empowerment of Service User Committees and comprehensive community awareness on
services offered and their respective standards are key for communities to demand
services and make Service Providers more accountable for services offered.

0 Put in place a sound and sustainable mechanism in advance that will cater for staff
motivation and rewards system for best performance.

 

1 The site-visit report is attached in Annex D.

 

Lessons learned will be systematically compiled between December and April 2011. Combined
with this a research study, is planned to focus on specific cultural and traditional issues that have
implications for the MPSCP. To assure the participation and involvement of poor and vulnerable
people the programme will be adapted to cater for cultural needs. Feedback and redress
mechanisms will be designed to fit with traditional systems and maximise public access to the

MPSCP.

Moreover, it is acknowledged that the roll out is also a process of "learning". Therefore, the
piloted Districts will be included into the first roll out cluster of 10—12 Districts and will serve as

practical advanced experiences.
3.3 The MPSCP content
The overall objective of the MPSCP is:

To improve public service delivery and ensure that basic public services are provided equally
to all people in Malawi in accordance with well-known, transparent, accountable and
realistic minimum standards.

The MPSCP programme has seven components reflecting the multi-faceted approach to Service
Charters. The components recognise the existing mandates of the Ministries and institutions
involved and the critical role these institutions will play in institutionalising the service charters.
Thus, they do not reflect the introduction of new functions, but rather a change to the way
existing functions are carried out.

The seven components and their expected outcomes are:

1. Public Service Charters Management: The expected outcome of this component is that
Public Service Charters are formulated and effectively institutionalised within selected
sectors.

2. Capacity Building: The expected outcome of the component is that public servants in all
sectors are aware of service standards, have the requisite skills and competencies to
deliver quality services to the public, and are well motivated to perform according to the
standards required.

3. District Level Charters: The expected outcome of the component is that service charters
are developed and implemented at district level. Legitimate structures to champion,
coordinate and target district services are established and fully operational.

4. Planning Budgeting & Financial Accountability: The expected outcome of the component
is that service charters guide the preparation of plans and budgets, and that audits reflect
the relationship between financial allocations and the standard of service delivery.

5. Monitoring and Reporting: The expected outcome of the component is that monitoring
of service delivery at all levels of government is improved and communities are
empowered to participate in monitoring service provision.

6. Feedback Mechanism: The expected outcome of this component is that Citizens have
access to effective complaint handling and redress mechanisms to correct poor service
delivery at both service provider and district levels.

7. Public Participation: The expected outcome of this component is that service charters
reflect public priorities and communities active/y use them to demand improved services

3.4 The MPSCP strategies

Development Fund, the Integrated Finance Management and Information Programme, the Quick
impact Results Programme, and initiatives for Performance Audit. lnterlinkages have been created
to mainstream service standards into core government functions as well as into the

programmes.

Reflecting the methodology and the multifaceted approach taken in developing Service Charters,
the Programme’s seven integrated components address the following priorities:

0 Development of Service Charters for individual sectors;
0 Building a service culture through capacity development and incentive systems;

0 improving awareness of standards by both service end-users and service providers
through the introduction of district level service charters;

0 Linking service standards to planning, budgeting and financial accountability mechanisms;

0 Strengthening monitoring systems including the pubiic’s engagement with monitoring and
auditing;
0 Strengthening appropriate feedback and redress mechanisms; and

0 Ensuring and strengthening opportunities for public dialogue and participation

 

 

2 It should be noted that where overlaps exist, activities have not been budgeted within the MPSCP budget.

Components 1 and 3 ensure the formulation and institutionalisation of Charters at national, sector
and district level and the remaining components seek to align Service Charters and use them to

create linkages between, existing mechanisms for planning, delivering, monitoring and providing
feedback on service delivery.

For the same reason, the programme approach is decentralized to ensure that the Ministry or
institution already mandated to carry out the relevant functions implements component activities.
Each component has its own cluster of strategies, outputs and activities.

4. The implementation of MPSCP — need for support

The MPSCP seeks to coordinate and exploit synergies between GoM strategies, reform
programmes and ongoing development programmes. in itself the MPSCP and the implementation
of service charters in Malawi avoids creating increased demands for additional funding and

extended budgets. On the contrary, the programme should contribute to a more effective,
efficient and targeted use of available resources.

Using service charters as an inter—programme coordination mechanism bares a high level of
complexity . In order to establish a robust framework for the MPSCP implementation:

o More time and a structured engagement between the Government and development
partners is required to establish the MPSCP management structure. Apart form the
Steering Committee, which is in place, the Technical Committee and the CIC need to be
established.

0 Integrate the contributions from several donors that use a variety of modalities to provide
support to the programme.

0 Establish a structured dialogue between 60M and DPs. Ensure a clear, integrated
reporting framework for financial expenditure and programme progress.

0 Ensure Government approval and the formal launch of the MPSCP.

These issues will be addressed during 2011 and a fully agreed, completely approved and financially
feasible five-year programme will be put in place.

The programme in 2011 will initiate the roll out of the Malawi Public Service Charter Programme
and will complete the Service charters in the first 10—12 districts. .

5. The proposed Implementation Support Project for the MPSCP

This proposal is designed to support the implementation of the MPSCP and covers a one—year
transition period from December 2010 to the end of November 2011. The transition is required to
move from the initial pilot service charter programme to the national Malawi Public Service
Charter Programme and complete during the transition arrangements for coordination, oversight,
financing and structured engagement between DPs, the Government and other stakeholders. The
one—year project outputs will include:

o Initiate implementation of the MPSCP and complete the Service Charters in 10 - 12

Districts.
0 Establish a sustainable MPSCP implementation framework.

The contribution of Irish Aid will specifically support:

1. Implementation activities for the roll out of District level charters (MPSCP component Ill),
where specific Districts for the Irish Aid support could be decided and with a particular

focus on:

o The set up and implementation of local service charter structures for dialogue between service
users and service providers.

0 Local monitoring of service delivery to ensure the quality and targeting of service delivery.

a Undertake a baseline survey on service-user’s perceptions of quality and level of the services
delivered and their priorities for future service.3

0 Integration of service charters into District planning and budgeting process including all
resources available for service delivery.

The 10-12 Districts that will be covered with the time frame of this project are expected to be:
Ntcheu, Dedza, Karonga, Mzuzu, Salima, Ntchisi, Lunchenza, Kasungu, Mneno, Machinga, Blantyre
City and Zomba.

In addition, a number of districts, including Lilongwe City and Lilongwe District, have announced
their interest in getting started, which means that the first cluster might be extended. .

2. Technical assistance for developing a robust implementation framework for the MPSCP, which
includes:

0 MPSCP launched by government and cooperation arrangement with DP established.

 

3 A national baseline survey on service perception is also planned to take place in 2011. The survey
mentioned here will be at District level, but coordinated with the national survey. These surveys will serve as
basis for tracking the real service-user and service delivery impact of implementing service charters. The

surveys will feed into the further development of M&E systems. "id “gr "t .,

a Clear programme management structure in place and functioning.
0 Integrated financial and programme progress reporting in place and functioning.

0 Overview of possible links with other programmes established and coordination in place and
functioning.

0 Sustainable funding of the MPSCP in place.

The expected outcome of the project is that:

Service Charters are developed and implemented at district level in at least 10 Districts. Legitimate
structures to champion, coordinate and target district service functions are established and fully
operational. MPSCP implementation framework is established and fully operational.

This outcome will be reached as a result of the following:

Roll out of District level charters will be established throuqh the followinq outputs":

Roll out plan for District level charters is established with the MoLGRD

The activities for District level Service Charters are operational (component ill) as
approved by the Steering Committee.5

The project’s roll out of District level charters shall be in line with the national MPSCP, component
Ill approach, which is described briefly below. The expected outcome of MPSCP-component ill will
be reached through the following strategies, which in principle have a five-year time horizons:

integration of Service Charter functions into district level structures

Strengthened structures for downward accountability to ensure representation of local
communities

Development and approval of District Service Charters

Strengthened feedback mechanisms and community to service provider interfaces
Facilitate the integration of Service Charters into the district planning and budgeting
processes

MPSCP implementation framework shall be established throuqh the followinq outputs:

Establish a structured engagement between 60M and DP as part of the MPSCP
management structure.

Complete programme design and the MPSCP Programme Support Document with a formal
GoM launch in 2011.

The MPSCP management structure is established.

The MPSCP M&E approach is designed with a clear focus on monitoring the level and
quality of the actual services delivered to the service end-users.

A sustainable funding of MPSCP Phase One (and preferably also Phase Two) is agreed and
signed by the 60M and the involved DP.

 

4 These outputs are related to the proposed project, whereas the outputs described in connection with component
III are for the full MPSCP period.

5 The output is dependent on external factors such as other component’s activities carried out in accordance with
the overall timetplan, and funds / resources available.

6 It niust be noted that this project proposal covers one year. Thus, the indicated outputs under the described
strategies are for the full programme period and not outputs of the project.

 

6. A coherent, feasible ﬁnancial framework and management system is established; including
an integrated reporting framework on financial expenditure and programme progress that
meets requirements of DP involved and provides a financial overview of all contributions

(in cash and in kind) of 60M and DPs.
7. The potential overlaps and synergies between MPSCP and other development

programmes are identified and an understanding between 60M and DP on exploiting

interlinkages to improve value for money is established.
8. A detailed implementation plan for the MPSCP period from 2012 — 2013 is prepared.

5.2. Management arrangements

During the first year of the MPSCP it will be of particular importance to establish a structured
result-oriented dialogue between Development Partners (DP) and the GoM. This dialogue should
be established within all existing forums of the MPSCP management structure, i.e. the Steering
Committee, the Technical Committee, the Component Implementation Committees and relevant
programme management structures at District level.

The Steering Committee for the MPSCP will also serve as the Steering Committee for the
implementation of this 1—year project.

The day-to-day operational management focal point of the project will be undertaken by the
PSRMU, including the Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) and the National Technical Advisor (BTA). The
PSRMU will serve as secretariat for the Steering Committee and be responsible for delivering
financial and progress reports for the quarterly meeting in the Steering Committee. These tasks
will be undertaken under the supervision and responsibility of the PS of Reforms at the PSRMU.

The Technical Committee will be chaired by the Director of Reforms at the PSRMU. Members of
the Technical committee will include Chairpersons from the Cle.

The lead institution for each component of the MPSCP will chair the CICs.

The DlHR Copenhagen and the CTA, will operate as management focal point in relation to the lrish
Aid, and as such be responsible to the Irish Aid for the Quality Assurance QA of financial and
progress reporting of the one—year project.

5.3. Oversight arrangements

The oversight arrangements will comprise the following activities:
0 Quarterly reporting on financial expenditure and project progress to the Steering
Committee.
0 QA from DlHR every six months.
0 External audit of funds channelled through the OPC.
0 An annual financial and narrative report for the one year project
0 Danish General Auditor is overseeing financial management at the DlHR

Funds from Irish Aid will be contributed via DlHR. The DlHR will be the fund management focal
point. The DlHR will release and transfer funds to GoM quarterly and on the basis of financial and

the OPC for further channelling out to specific programme activities.

 

5.4. Timeline

A time plan for the one-year project is below. This

included in this proposal but equally important to
proposal.

time plan covers also areas, which are not
synchronize with activities included in this

A detailed time and implementation plan for the MPSCP is available and will serve as guideline for
the specific and more detailed action plans of the components.

5.5. Budget
This one-year project amounts to a total of€ 350,000.

The budget will cover support to the initial District level charter roll out, including development of
M&E on end-user results and technical assistance. The support will in particular target Districts
where lrish Aid is already engaged with other support activities. The budget will furthermore
support establishment of the MPSCP implementation framework, as well as support to establish

necessary connections between national level charters and M&E systems and District level
charters.

A budget summary is attached in Annex B.

A detailed budget is attached in Annex C.
